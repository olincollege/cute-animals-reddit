Beautiful family! May you make many more happy memories together.
It took me until the end of that to realize you really meant you do the heavy lifting. Cute card!
This is so sweet. Thank you for sharing. Glad you have this time with them. Happy holidays.
My grandpa is native and my grandma is literally the whitest person on earth so I feel like I never see grandparents that look like mine
Y'all look so cute! Enjoy this time with them.  All of my grandparents were gone by the time I was 20 and I would give anything to be able to have an adult conversation with them about life and anything and everything.
This is amazing! I live with my grandparents right now, as well (my grandma's got cancer), and I think I'm gonna cry when I have to leave. Good grandparents are the sweetest, most lovable people ever!
Why can I smell this house?
I lived with my grandparents for a semester in college ... It was the best 6 months of my life. Anytime I come back to their house and walk into what was my room there, I get overloaded with nostalgic sadness. I would do anything to go back to that time of my life...
Grandpa gets the mail! All day, every day.
I try to spend as much time with them as I can when I‚Äôm home and just try to set aside time for my friends as well. Ultimately they love me and want me to have friends and do fun things. Just remember that they don‚Äôt rely on you to live their lives. My grandma has a whole life outside of me that‚Äôs easy to forget about.
I‚Äôm burying my grandfather in about 12 hours, so this really tugs on my heart strings.  You‚Äôll never have all of the time with them that you want, but you can make it all quality time.  Enjoy the love that only grandparents can give and listen to all of their stories.
Which one are you
This is amazing that you make time for your grandparents. Too often they are forgotten until its too late. I have to know though, Do you really hate ducks?
Merry christmas! may you have a wonderful life!
I love the way you and your grandparents divided the tasks!  Somehow, I think Grandpa has it pretty easy, though.
I lived with my Grandfather on and off for 17 years.

My father was abusive and my mum arguably had battered wife syndrome. One day when I was 18 I rang my grandfather who lived 500km from me.

'I need to get out, can I move in with you?'
'Absolutely'

(or something like that it was 20 years ago).

Packed all my shit together and drove my 1961 beetle to the big smoke. The deal was I'd do the things he no longer could and a whole bunch of chores, and he would support me through university.

I had a lot of ups and downs but he always supported me even when he got pissy with my decision making. I had never had that before.

I lived with him in the last years of his life and was lucky enough to hold his hand as he passed.

He was the reason i went to and passed university, got my Masters Degree and had the confidence to move half way around the world to chase my dreams. 

Grandparents are the best. Cherish every moment you get to live with them and remember what might seem easy to you, could be hard on them because, well older. Stay patient and enjoy the experience. I wish you all much happiness and perhaps you'll get to live with them as long as I did mine!
Comet's what?
Your grandpa and grandma are holding hands for the photo. Too precious. You‚Äôre making their Christmas by doing that with them
Living with grandparents is the best. I wish mine were still around. But I still have all the good memories. And now I live in my most favorite house ever: their old house I grew up in with them. Cherish your grandparents, all time spent with them is priceless.
Treasure this time with them. So cute!
I love how your grandother looks unsure and somewhat terrified at this technology taking the picture and he is secretly gently taking her hand to reassure her. 

It's how I'm reading it as a total stranger.

Oh, and love the light tights ü§£
But why do you hate ducks Jill üòü
Omg hes holding your grandma's hand. I love this.
cherish these times
After college I moved in with my grandma for almost a year. It was the best year ever. She made us breakfast every morning, I'd take out her trash, we'd stay up late watching old movies and became obsessed with the craziness of the bachelorette series. It was kinda a sad parting when I got a real job and had to move. I still go visit her every Sunday morning for breakfast tacos. Grandparents are the best!
How is this aww related?
Her pants is what's up
They have the 1970s grandparents house! Dizzy Izzy had that. That‚Äôs what we called my mom‚Äôs mom who had really insane hallucinations after her husband died and was mean as hell. She came to live with us and would walk around in the dark at night. She‚Äôd open the curtains and point outside and be like look how sunny it is and it‚Äôd be pitch black. She crapped on the floor and told people my dad beat her. She screamed about seeing spiders on the wall one day and was hospitalized and had ECTs. It was fucked. She lived another like 10 years after that. She called and said she wanted me to drive to SC to see her so she could be close to me for once. She died the next day.

Anyway, your grandparents look great!
Cute!
This is so heartwarming
Is that a Santa lamp? Or a Santa statue on the lamp pedestal?
never mind - take your upvoteüòÅ
Those leggings are the most Christmas item of clothing ever.
This makes me want to cry, it's so wholesome! Have a lovely Christmas!
They probably loved that you wanted to do this ‚ò∫Ô∏è
So festive! These Christmas cards will definitely earn a spot on the fridge instead of going out with the recycling after New Year‚Äôs Day.
You look exactly what I imagine a redditor looks like.
Adorable family!
How is this aww related?

Holy moly it isn't Christmas though

Love it
SHOES ON CARPET

WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE ???!!!
r/cringetopia worthy
So many nostalgic details here: the good ole wood paneling, ceiling fan that‚Äôs so low ya gotta such a little to get by, the vented door of the utility closet, etc.  I can just feel the carpet under my toes.

But what I love MOST is how their hands come together.  There is such ease in how they‚Äôre holding hands and yet, you can almost see how much he adores her and how much she trusts him to be the leader despite any dementia or difficulty.  

That was a nice little glimpse into what must be a very beautiful time and family‚Äôs holiday.
hi jill i like ducks
Ever see that episode of Rick and Morty where Rick injects Morty with something that gives him a super powered arm?
Do u rlly hate ducks?
LOVE IT!
Embrace every moment- especially meals and holidays
I love how your grandpa looks like he has no idea what's going on but is doing it anyway for you two. :)
I too want to have grandparents who didn‚Äôt criticise everything about me and how im doing everything wrong T.T
This makes me smile cherish every moment with them Grandparents are a real treasure. 
I lost my nan to cancer in August and my Gamps is dying of cancer also he was taken to hospital last night and we dont know if he will come out. So seeing this really touched my heart.
IDK if it's just me. But you guys look like cut out boards
I really hope everyone on mobile zoomed in on your grandparents' hats lol.
Enjoy this time with them.  I suggest recording a ton of videos, pictures are great, but the videos are the real memories.
O
Good granddaughter Jill.
I would like to ditch my family and join this one!

Let me know when theres an opening.
Oh man, that classic wood paneling  of the late 70's/80's. 

I love it and I love that they still have it.
I did the same thing. Don't feel bad when you leave.
This is so wholesome
Damn, I wish I could move in with my grandparents
That is SO awesome! What an amazing team! Love your Christmas card picture!
I‚Äôm Australian and this is the epitome of what I think American cards look like I LOVE IT
This is wholesome af
Hey, I have those same lightbulb pants!
kinda sounds more like a r/sadcringe than a r/aww
Grandma looks like she‚Äôs always cooked for many but barely ever ate much herself. Reminds me of a friends mom who was the most amazing cook/baker/butcher in the kitchen and basically cooked all day everyday for her large family. Herself? Never ate a plate of food in her life, just grazed all day, drank coffee, eventually she was okay with admitting she wasn‚Äôt much for food, in general, but absolutely loved to cook and feed people and loved to do it really well. She made so much stuff at Christmas she‚Äôd start giving me my box of goodies early December, one to take home for my folks as well, then do it again half dozen times more as the season progressed. She was awesome. Your Granny reminded me of that lol.
I love stories of inter-generational living arrangements - we make our own family and we can have beautiful, symbiotic relationships. Love it. Happy holidays to all of you!
Aw cute! Join us over on r/randomactsofcards and spread the card cheer!
Beautiful. Cherish the time you spend together. I miss my grandparents so much. I wish I had spent more time with them!! Have a great holiday!!‚ò∫Ô∏è
Nice! I like grandpa's hat!
This is fantastic being able to live with different generations of your family. Grandparents can provide that mature perspective that‚Äôs quite different from ones own parents.
Ok
You can feel the pain in their eyes man. Getting that old has to suck
What is with grandfather's and their joy of getting the mail? My grandpa will race you to the mail box and has his special letter opener
This is wonderful. My Gram was my everything and died on my birthday two years ago. I dread holidays now but your post made me smile!
Please tell your grandpa I love his hat

Please don‚Äôt hate ducks :(
You go girl! You're living the dream, I also moved in with my grandparents two years ago and it was great we made a great team but then my grandpa passed away a year ago, since then things hasn't been so smooth like they were. From someone who misses his grandpa as words cannot describe, please, enjoy them and take great care of them. May your time with them make for some great, cherishable memories.
My mind immediately went to my own Grandpa so I assume that Grandpa gets the mail because he wants to do a bunch of other things but isn't allowed to. 

"Gonna mow the lawn"
'Are you insane?! Sit down."
"Gonna take out the trash"
'Grandpa no! Sit down!'
"Well at least let me get the mail"
'... fine yeah go get the mail'
Why does everyone kind of look photoshopped into the picture?
I love your leggings. I need them in my life!!
Nice Christmas light sweats üòÇüëçüèªüòä
those pants are lit
Oh my god, their house is giving me such nostalgia for my own grandparents‚Äô old home.. right down to the wood paneling. Enjoy every minute you have with them!
Merry Christmas! This will be the first Christmas for me without a grandparent and seeing your post was a very bright spot in my otherwise gloomy evening. You make a great team!
This is so lovely! I wish I had the chance to have done this with my grandparents üò≠
I want a 90s sitcom of this.
Getting the mail. I cant wait until that's my only job of the day.
Very handsome family.
His biggest delusions surround his childhood. He thinks he was a child genius that taught his school from the age of 5. Also that he went to work for Washington DC in elementary paddling a boat in world war 2 that picked up pilots that had to eject from their planes. I do still ask them lots of questions bc even if his stories aren‚Äôt real I love to hear his enthusiasm when recounting them and how proud he is
I‚Äôm sure your grandpa isn‚Äôt as useless as you make him out to be. He probably devoted his entire life to his work and his family. Give him a little more credit.
... but why do you hate ducks?
Christmas tree is already up, before Thanksgiving?
Merry Christmas. I like your Christmas light pants
[removed]
That's very nice of you......I hope somebody takes care of me down the road
I love that they are holding hands.
I wish I had close grandparents. Grandma on my dads side died before I was born and step-grandma was a bitch until my grandpa died and she disappeared with his money
Love it. If it were ever necessary, I'd live with my grandparents/have them come live with me in a heart beat. They're the best people. They inspire me to be a better person, and the way they look at each other really shows what true love is!
I love your leggings!
i love you all!! grandparents are the best people in the world
Dream team
But why does Jill hate ducks?
I absolutely live this! Wish I had the relationship you do with my late grandparents or even my own parents. But it makes me happy to know good ones exist out there!
Why are you wearing shoes indoors, which are clearly meant for outdoors? :>
I love the wood on the walls. Reminds me of my grandparents house.
I'm incredibly happy for you! My cousin moved in with our grandparents many years ago. They helped get him back on his feet. Grandparents are amazing.
So this is what love is
Aww that‚Äôs awesome!! Enjoy it and don‚Äôt take it for granted
You are proof that there are special people in the world.
So sweet!
Shitter's full!
I‚Äôm sure they appreciate your help and company.
One of the sweetest things ever! You won't regret it. They definitely are grateful. Blessed family!
This is so sweet. I never knew any of my grandparents on either side - as they died when I was very young. Though my parents have told me lots of stories about them. My husband‚Äôs grandpa lived to be 102 and he grew up as an orphan on the streets of NYC who later became a cop and than a teacher. I wish I had met my husband earlier because I would have loved to record his stories/life experiences. üò≠
Stay blessed all of you.
I, too, am a grown up who lives with my grandparents (they live downstairs, as the front stairs are a bit too much for them) and I love it so much! We are the best team and I love them with all of my heart. I'm so happy to see other people doing this! Spend as much time with them as you possibly can!
Geez this is so endearing. I heard there's a service that helps college students find empty nesters to room with and the results have been overwhelmingly positive. There's a synergy in the whole intergenerational thing.
This is just so awesome and wholesome! I hope you all have an awesome christmas:D
Honestly, living with parent/grandparent is underrated.  If you can work out the boundaries issue, it is so worth it.
Im pretty sure grandpa does a lot more... like pays for everything!
Coming from a culture where living with parents and grandparents is a common affair, I can assure you this is going to be the best time of your life.
Grandma's Boy 2: Grandma's Girl
Sweet
Just noticed them holding hands. This is so wholesome!
‚ù§Ô∏è
But what's wrong with ducks :(
Why do you hate ducks?
Oh my goodness, i just noticed your grandparents are holding hands. So wholesome
Is this a real picture? I have so many questions
But.. the ducks?
Walmart Cobie Smulders
Awwww, bless your little family!
At first i thought grandma's thumb was grandpa's pinky haha
This is so precious!! I miss my grandparents so much; enjoy time with them a little extra for me, please! Also. Those tights? Yesssssssss. üéÑüéÑüéÑ
Real blessing! Merry Christmas in advance.
I wish I could‚Äôve done this with my grandparents! I shall try to bring up sending family Christmas cards to my parents. We‚Äôve never done them and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like to do.
I live with my grandparents too. Makes me happy when I come home from work and watch MeTV with gramps all night.
My heart is melting, what a lovely family.
You know when u see something ..and go..yup..this is the best thing i see today..congrats ..this is the best thing I see today
The wrapping paper I had as a child is on leggings now?
Just putting it out there you are very cute grandparents too
0-0 We see who wears the antlers! >.<
Is it me or does everyone look photo shopped in?
Wtf
Grandparents have been saving the day for abooouuut 70,000 years now
This makes my heart happy. I took care of my grandparents as well and it is truly a gift to be a caregiver for them.
Adorable!
This is the best thing I've seen this week.
Good for you OP, cherish them while you can. I live with my grandparents as well, same situation. Grandma does everything lmao
Go Gramps! Get that mail!
Jealous
I don‚Äôt know you guys but I love you all
Darling!  Enjoy the time with your grandparents!  My dad, cousin, and I rotated living with my grandmother as she needed more help- so many special memories together during that time.
So those pants are the best pants ever and why you hate ducks
I‚Äôm really happy for you
If you're good to them, your presence is probably adding years to their lives. Be good to them.
I really miss my grandparents.  I wish every day I could spend more time with them.  Cherish and love this time for everything it is worth.
Great story I love it! I just spent the day with my two granddaughters. Merry Christmas to you and your grandparents. I bet there so happy to have you.
Ugh grandpa holding grandmas hand just got me <3
Who clicked the photo, OP?
Since grandpa gets the mail and grandma does everything else what do u do ?
I hate my family and I‚Äôve been a real butthole grinch about the concept of centering your life around your family lately, but I read this 3x and teared up with a lump in my throat. This is so wholesome and beautiful and what intergenerational bonding and love and family should be. Full circle of life shit that encapsulates what it means to be human. Sorry if I‚Äôm rambling. I‚Äôm just so glad I got to see this before bedtime. Thank you for sharing this goodness!
Anyone ever tell you you look like JaidenAnimations?
Man I have the same wall paneling still in my house. Very 70s.
Beautiful combination and what a way to spend quality time with wholesome family members and a different generation! Well done and enjoy!
Are you American? Because this is how I imagine every American grandparents.
wearing shoes indoors on a carpet...
This is why I love the internet! I am so happy for you, and your grandparents!
So beautiful. Wish my Nannas were still here.
I miss my grandma :(
ITS NOT DECEMBER YET BAH HUMBUG FUCKERS
I might be way off, but looking at the picture and looking at the comments for some reason seems really off to me. Uneasy.
Can I move in with your grandparents too?
You have a lovely welcoming smile
 What a beautiful family
oh i bet youre eating GOOD!
This is such a wholesome thing. I love it.
The best summer of my life was spent living with my grandparents.  Nothing is better than spending time with your grandparents who love you.
Love the sneaky hands holding. So adorable üòç all the love for all of you
Bless yalls hearts
Op, why do you hate ducks do your grandparents also hate ducks?
This is nice...More of this please.
This is adorable ‚ù£Ô∏è
this is so wholesome i‚Äôm gonna pass out
Are all the people who tried to demonize the guy who shared a picture of his brother with Downs Syndrome going to do the same with this pic?  

If we aren't allowed to be happy to see a photo of someone with Downs being happy, what makes this photo any different?
Lovely. Merry Christmas!
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Lol rip your dms ;) happy holidays to you and yours!
Team!
Grandparents are literally the best thing ever. I miss mine greatly.
Our gran moved in with me and my husband last month and it's been awesome. Shes a millenial in an 80 year old body. Love her to bits. Americans gotta move away from retirement homes being the norm and go back to bringing old people into their homes. It's cheaper and she helps around the house, too. Not to mention we get to have her around to hang out with.
[removed]
That's so heart warming!
That's a hella of an alpha man
I looooove those leggings, where did you get them?
Asdgvb
Teamwork makes the dream work
Happy xmas
That sounds wonderful made me smile
Cherish your time with your grandparents.
Not a meme but ever so wholesome.
I really love that they are holding hands.
Y'all look adorable
Why do you hate ducks Jill.
This is wonderful. God Bless you and beautiful family.
haha so funny
nice
Get a life. Then live it to its fullest with all your family. Same to the rest of you out there.
Your grandparents look midly confused, but you look so happy!
Your family is awesome. I think you are so fortunate to get the opportunity to live with them. I never had an adult relationship with any of my grandparents, and while I will always cherish my childhood memories. I regret not being able to know them as an adult, I missed an opportunity to really learn about my family‚Äôs history, and our story. 

This has always bothered me, it has always felt like something was missing. I don‚Äôt think it will ever go away. 

Happy holidays to you and your lovely grandparents, you are all so lucky to have each other.
This is really sweet.
‚ÄúNovember 17:  Today the Christmas cards began...‚Äù
What a wonderful family! Cherish and love every minute of it. I have nobody to spend my Christmas with. And no one to call my own. This makes it so much special to see this.
My grandparents house has the same oak wall design! Never thought I‚Äôd see it anywhere else.
Aww this is a great photo! Enjoy them while you can. You will cherish the memories later in your life.
Love your tights!!
Precious family. You're fortunate to have each other.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Sounds like you two are overworking him. Maybe get the mail for him on sundays haha.
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
You have made a lot of people‚Äôs Christmas a little better with this lovely, simple photo.
My favorite part is your grandparents holding hands! So cute. Really made me smile
This is so sweet  Alexa play despacito.
This is great. How it should be, IMHO. We‚Äôre meant to live together and support each other
Grampa is low key holding grammas hand for this picture, and my goodness!! üò©üò©üò© That is the sweetest little insignificant move!! It really reminds me of my grandparents and now I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying!! üòÖ‚ù§Ô∏è I love this
Wholesome af
Obligatory "you're cute" and "what did ducks ever do to you?" üòÜ
So sweet. ‚ô•Ô∏è
I envy the fact that you have the chance to do thas-sadly I never did. Enjoy the time!!
I live in a multi-generational household too.  It is so awesome.  Living with multiple adults is difficult because we all want things our own way and have to negotiate that.  But sharing responsibilities is amazing! It makes me wonder what idiot created stupididea of people moving out as soon add they're adults.
Love your pants
Precious.
They're lucky to have you and you're lucky to have them!  I just moved my 81 year old dad in with me in Sept and its great!
It is an experience you will never forget!! If you are interested in the family genealogy at all now is the time to ask the questions. Make videos of them talking or just doing stuff around the house. Will mean the world to you later when you can still see and hear them. My experience anyway :)
I am glad you are spending time with them my only living grandparent is in Cuba I have not seen her in a while and my granddad passed away three day after my birthday so I am genuinely I'm happy for you no sarcasm btw I am genuinely happy for you you guys make a cute family üòä
OP you're cute af, happy holidays.
What a beautiful photo xx
Wholesome post. Thank you. 

But am I the only one to misread your username??

I am sorry.
Why do all of you have shoes on inside the house?
I love that they are holding hands
You guys are so cute! I love the way they‚Äôre holding hands <3
This is so sweet. Makes me miss my grandparents.
Grandpa going with the Swanson red and black. Lucky boy.
Why are you wearing boots?
Your grandparents are adorable!  Cherish each moment with them!  All mine have gone to heaven!  This is a very cute pic!
You guys are very sweet
Why do you hate ducks? They're the good ones, Geese are the evil ones.
I want to know the duck(s) story
I'm just curious as to how busy you stay doing technology to use your word.
I just moved in with my grandparents a month ago too! My grandpa is mostly blind but he's also the one who gets the mail and makes sure the doors are locked. I also do the heavy lifting and most recently the raking.
Beautiful family positive vibes
It‚Äôs adorable that he‚Äôs holding his wifes hand.
Okay I know this is wholesome but your grandparents look like they could be in resident evil
I love this
It's probably great for your grandma's mental health. Having a purpose, to be needed, often is what keeps people going.
I love that they are holding hands:)
I envy you! Never got the chance to enjoy my grandparents :( They all died when I was too young.
Aww your grandpa is holding your grandmas hand how cute
Love them as if everyday is their last, I no longer have my grandparents and I miss them all the time. I wish I had the opportunity to live with them.
I love you
Why do you hate ducks?
I would like to subscribe to a newsletter in which you three routinely take holiday photos, but for [really lame or obscure holidays](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/fun/).
Looks like a fun bunch
I feel grandpa is being overburdened with the chores
I have that exact same smoke detector
Where can I buy those pants? Asking for a friend.
You know, if op changes just one letter of their username, they'd have a totally different username... Ehemmm
Love this! So encouraging to see support and respect for our elders that most other countries have engrained in their culture. Time for the boomer view that their parents and elders are disposable to stop. That said, they are at that age now so... #fightageism
You've got some guns on those arms!!

Are you a body builder?
you guys are so cute‚ù§Ô∏è
I feel a you look like joke building.
This is my favorite wholesome post.  Sounds like I'll use it as my Christmas cards.
So wholesome
Fancy Pants!
This is wholesome af.
This is lovely ‚ù§Ô∏è
American Gothic Christmas
Bless you!  üí´
Thank you for sharing, this brought a smile.  Hope you guys have a wonderful xmas.
This just made me smile big!
You go girl!
So sweet !
Lived with my grandma from 13-21 y/o and she‚Äôs my best friend! Moving out of her house was the hardest thing ever because she became my mom and she lived in a big house practically by herself so she started having really bad anxiety :( We set up cameras and extra bright lights everywhere so she feels better but I‚Äôm married and 25 y/o and I still miss everything she did for me like cooking, cleaning, and saving me from my everyday issues haha. Cherish them while you have them and make all the memories you can!
May ur grandparents live long happily
Pro-tip: living with them will not be easy all the time, but you won‚Äôt understand how much it means to you until you don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt. 

Ask about their youth and adolescence, the good and bad and record what you can on your phone so you can expand their legacy however triumphant or trivial it might be..

I have these recordings i made of my grandpa telling me about Wwii experiences that he never told anyone including my grandma or anyone else, and since he‚Äôs passed away listening to them brings me right back to hanging out with him.. it sounds cheesy but it‚Äôs comforting in a way and is also a reminder to be open and honest with the ones you love.
It warms my heart to see grandchildren care for and love their grandparents. 

Honestly, my pawpaw is very lonely. I know he kinda brought it on himself, he wasn't much of a grandpa for my cousins who are older than me, and not for me either. He had a drinking problem. But now he's 93 years old, sitting in a home. I don't think any of my cousins ever visit him. Me and my bf goes to visit him from time to time, and it makes him sooooo happy. During high school I used to clean his apartment every other week for extra cash, but I continued to clean it after graduating and getting a job, just to hang out with him. I'm really happy we've connected now after all these years. I really love him. I should tell him that.
I can smell this picture and it smells comforting and now I miss my grandparents.
Dude - Live it up. Caring for my grandma before she died is something I am incredibly proud of.
I think I'm in love with you!
Hey don‚Äôt give grandpa a bad wrap
great looking grandparents, but instead of sending out cards you should send out those tights.
Ask your granma for me,what she eats,so skinnyüòçü§ó you are lucky to have them. I grew up on the farm with grandparents,best years
You guys look ready for anything!!
Nice
This is very lovely. Thank you for sharing.
Such a pure post with not a hint of pretence. Just 3 family members enjoying xmas together. It's beautiful
I love this!!! Congratulations on being broad minded and loving! My mom lives with me and my husband. Our youngest daughter and her husband and their son also live with us. Someone is always at the house to see to my mom, and my mom loves to help with her great grandson when she can. Your grandparents are very blessed to have your help and I love this picture, and this post. +1 and wish it was more.
I love this so much.
That's so awesome that your grandpa is holding your grandma's hand, I hope to be that sweet when I'm that age!
I love this!  Grandparents are the best.
Great looking family, and you are very pretty.
Who pays the rent?
You are slav now
Love every bit of this and ... it‚Äôs nice to see the grand kids just helping out and making sure life is good for the grandparents who I‚Äôm sure woulda gave you everything... anyways love this and I miss my grandma ... appreciate every day with her cause their personality is one of a kind :)
Looking Cool ... Merry Christmas üòçüòä
As someone who didn‚Äôt know any of their relatives past my parents I envy you! 

Happy holidays:)
The level of depth i could go into how much i love this post is most likely a novels length. Something i do have the desire to do, but don't have the time. To put it simply, i love everything about this post. It makes me very very happy, thank you for sharing.
I wish i had a granpa. :/
That's a beautiful story. A united household working in harmony.....
You really do look like an amazing team. So beautiful to see youngsters having good relationships with their older once. Much love ‚ô°
Nice
Looks photoshopped for some reason.
This is absolutely stunning ‚ù§Ô∏è
You guys combined are 305lbs.
Very cute. What's wrong with ducks by the way?
This is so lovely!
I loove this. I wish my grandparents were like yours. I wasn't that lucky...
I love hate Reddit for these threads. Got me real conflicted and settling in isolation.
You guys üòç
You madlad having a Xmas tree up this early!
These are okay boomers
I‚Äôve lived with my grandpa the last 5 years. Although challenging at times I would trade it for anything. He looked after me when I was younger, I‚Äôm repaying the favor. Cute family!!
I did the same thing when I was 18 and going to university. 3 months turned into 3 years and they became my best friends.  I treasure that time with them, I have all their stories they told me, inside jokes etc.
Before my grandfather passed away and I was living on the other side of the world I encouraged my cousins to spend as much time with them, to get the stories and learn from them.
My situation is not too different from yours I‚Äôm living with my parents and I often do most of the manual labor in exchange for living with them, once I have a job I‚Äôll be paying them rent.
Wait, which one is you?
Perfect family.  Enjoy!
it's not directly visible but the warmth and happiness you brought to these people hearts is unremarkable
I love this so freaking much.
I miss my grandparents SO much (I had 3 sets, too, because my dad was adopted at 10 and in the equivalent of what an open adoption is today).

Grandparents are the literal best!
What's on his hat?
More happy memories to come!
You rock!
Long live the Santa family !
This place has so many nice people
Beautiful!!! This warms my heart!
Beautiful family OP! I also moved in with my grandparents a month ago. Living in the countryside now, it's so peaceful and they're awesome :)

God bless you all and Merry Christmas to ya
Awe, he's holding her hand ‚ù§. Very sweet.
Aww
I miss wood paneling. It was such a large part of my life, up until I had to sell my childhood home a few mo the ago. 

Cherish this time with them. You‚Äôll miss it when you‚Äôre older.
Enjoy every minute of it. I've lived across the hall from my grandparents for 8 years - the last few I've tried to help a little more than before as it was getting harder for them. My grandpa died a few weeks ago and I miss him terribly but I'm so happy I got to see him pretty much every day for 8 years!
I hope u guys continue to enjoy eachothers company and bond, do as much while u can!
Those leggings are awesome
Great team! üòä
This picture made me all warm and fuzzy inside.  I think it's the xmas spirit creeping up.
So your granny has always been your grandpa's legal slave?
ur grandma kinda hot
Cherish them, lass. You don't realise what you have until it's gone. I miss mine something fierce.
Merry Christmas and may ducks shit on your grave.
That's a good initiative
Enjoyed reading this thread. 
Thanks for sharing & contributing fellow Redditors!
Am I the only one that thought they were cardboard cutouts?
This is probably going to bother some, which is by no measure my intention, so please forgive me in advance, but I really couldn't help thinking "American Gothic" when I saw this picture. *ducks & dodges*

Kudos to you for choosing to be with your Grandparents. I'm sure it will be a wonderful and rewarding experience.
You look so sweet! I'm sure they're happy to have you!! Help them lifting the heavy stuff! But I'm sure your grandpa tells you not to worry though :D
Im beginning to think all grandparents have the same carpet and wood paneling lol. This pic gave me nostalgia.
Nice.
That rug and shoes inside, very american.
Jill, you are awesome!!
You guys has done fantastic
Family is best! Good on you! Learn grandma's recipes! I bet she has some great cooking skills!
So cute . Happy holidays to you and grandma and grandpa
You look like Bugha from fortnite
I love this, the photo, the sentiment and the teamness of you all. I wish you the best
Why move out from the parents house just to go to *their* parents? Something happen?
He‚Äôs holding their hands <3
I guess Gramps likes caring for you but... Don't you think you're overworking him?

Jk. To quote God: "if y'all do y'job right, no one'll even know y'there."
I love this ! You have a beautiful family.
So whens the first season coming out??
This is so cute!
That's so cute!
So adorable!
Finally, no animals in the post to /r/aww
Very nice of u to take care of them!
You look lovely! Happy holidays team perfect!
Am I the only one thinking they look like cardboard cut-outs?
ugogurl and grandparents
After zooming in on the DVD collection and seeing Christmas with the Kranks, I'm smiling twice as hard. Wholesome.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the care and love you.
That‚Äôs a righteous pair of leggings.
You guys are precious together. Glad that all of you make an awesome team. Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas!
How is Grandma cool with shoes in the house?
that's cute
I live with my grandparents too, my Nan has Alzheimer‚Äôs and vascular dementia and Grandad has a list of issues but it‚Äôs pretty much fine but is 85 so I‚Äôve come to help him out with my Nan who isn‚Äôt super with it anymore.

They basically brought me up so it‚Äôs really the least I can do.
Ur a gem for loving ur grandparents! Very rare these days!
I don't mean what I'm about to say in a way that is hurtful to you -- I promise! You really really look like a chubbier Robin from How I Met Your Mother and it's mind of freaking me out.
I can see Canadians from a mile away
Yeah i bet pops could deadlift more than you
I love that your grandparents are holding hands. That makes my heart fuzzy and warm.
I'm getting real American Gothic vibes, but mixed with Disney's Up
Dream team üéÖ
I almost got to live with my grandparents during college and it would have been awesome.  I bet it would have helped them live even longer.  Keep having fun!
So very wholesome. I lived with my grandmother on my mums side for a lot of my high school years and into my early adulthood. She passed away 2 years ago and I find myself regretting I didn't treat her better and looked after her the way I should have. She was the sweetest lady who lived to the age of 98. Cherish your grandparents while you can.
As someone who has lived with grandparents while finishing up my undergrad studies- this is an amazing thing! I enjoyed every single moment with them, they taught me and inspired me every single day. You are one of the lucky ones :)
I sent 3 years living with my grandmother im very happy i did . She fell twice in the time i was there i don't know what she would have done if i had not been there.
that sneaky hand hold he's got going is so cute.
This is my favourite post of the season. I don't really have family and this makes me really happy to see ‚ù§Ô∏è
Your Grandad looks a bit like Harry Dean Stanton.
I like that they are still holding hands after so long.
Shout out to the family.
Btw you guys have the hat swag going. I like it.
What a great picture and lovely story. When I left my abusive ex husband,  my daughters and I moved in with my mom. We planned to stay 6 months and wound up staying 3 years. We're still here and while it has its challenges, I'm so glad we have each other.  My mom has recently had some health issues, and has had 3 surgeries in 3 years.  I'm glad I was here to help her.  I work full time and she helps me with my daughters. I think our culture is moving back to extended families living together ( due to the economy) and it's wonderful.

Give your sweet grandparents a big hug!
This is so sweet! OP please look after them! I have no grandparents left, and I really regret not seeing some of them much before they passed away. I kept telling myself I'd go visit my Grandad John "soon" or "when I have enough time and money" since he lived at the other end of the country. He died before I could make it down there. Please please everyone who reads this, learn from my mistake ‚ù§Ô∏è
I want grandpa's job.

Merry Christmas belated and early.
I moved in with my grandparents a few years ago too. I helped out around the house to do whatever they couldn't or wouldn't. Then I ended up getting a new job and moving across the country. I called them fairly often but I also made a lot of excuses as to why I couldn't come back just yet to visit. My grandma ended up passing away before I had the chance to see her again. I thought I had all the time in the world and it was ripped away from me in an instant. 

Please, listen to all the replies that are reminders to cherish moments you have with them both, and don't pass up any chance to spend time with them. Judging by the cool card, it looks like you won't.
That's pretty awesome.
Love the jam jam pants
I‚Äôm hoping my son will make this same choice with my mom when he‚Äôs older. I think it would be good for both. You all look amazing!
This is so cute omg
I thought grandpa had a weird thumb pinky for a sec
U should wear a red coat too, then it would be the dream team
You sweet girl, this is wonderful!
This really warms my heart. I was raised by my grandparents before moving across the country so this really brings me back. They‚Äôre still going strong but I miss that time with them.
Free rent
This made me really happy. Your grandparents must be extremely happy they get to spend more time with their grand daughter
That is a wonderful Christmas Card picture. I hope you have many years with your grandparents.
OK Boomer
Nose slide in ski-jump?

I love you 3000.
What a fortunate position to be in.
This is so awesome. Within the past year, my grandfather who has dementia and heart problems has been put on hospice. My sister moved down to live with them, my mom retired and moved up here too, and my husband and I have been here for 3 years to help too. Rallying around our elders in the times where their bodies are weak is so important . I love the pride you have that you are able to live with them and help where needed. You have a beautiful soul. Happy holidays to you all.
Will you send me a Christmas card?
This was the situation I found myself in about 5 years ago. It's just me & Granny now, but I've cherished every moment getting to spend time with my grandparents. Please know they're loving every minute of it too, & tell them you love them everyday. Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays to this perfect team!
So who is that person in the background?
how sweet :)
Love this! I lived with my grandmother for 8 years (moved out in 2007) and those were some of the best years of my life.
That wall board behind you and the tree. My grandparents had the exact same walls in their house, and I've never seen them anywhere else in my life. Now I'm missing them. They were really good people and super fun to hang out with.
Doesn't seem like a balanced character roster
Grandma OP
I love this picture and that you all are sending Christmas Cards, it would definitely stay on the fridge all year at my house :)
You kinda look like Tawny from Even Stevens
Give them a hug for me.  My grandma and Papa Joe both had forms of dementia, but they were a part of who I have become.  I miss them so much.
I love this! Great job - your grandparents probably truly love having you around.
Love the pants!
You guys are the spirit of Christmas!
I love it!!
Anyone notice that gran and gramps are still holding hands? Just go back and check it out.
I love that they're holding hands. It gave it a whole heaping extra dose of 'aww'.
Grandma's TINY hat T.T
This is so damn wholesome! Wish I was on your Christmas card list!!
So lovely, I wish I could go back in time to do this. Please realize the chance you have and cherish such time, every single minute.
Merry Christmas :)
Relationships like these are of the up most importance! Ask a lot of questions about their lives growing up during morning coffee (I've found it the best time for long and detailed conversations. I guess it's all the caffeine and thin pretzels that amps them up!)  Then grab yourself a journal and start dating/writing all this information and the stories! Its beautiful to have their memories for the future/current family and you can even create cute gifts for them from their life stories! Its one of my favorite things to do with my Nanna! Enjoy your time together! ‚ù§
I loved living with my grandma! I lived with her most of my life. I just moved out again at age 30. I miss living with her.

I would handle the technology and bills and stuff and she would be the handyman.
I love how they‚Äôre holding hands.
Beijing: what are you gonna do? sanction me?
Dude I'm gonna have a grandchild like you some day
Blast from the past, we had the same wood paneling where I grew up. I‚Äôm sure they appreciative help:)
I lived with my great grandmother for two years while I was in school. Even though I told her not to, she was up every morning at 6 to cook breakfast for me. The only time I heard her cuss while I was living there was because she woke up as I was walking out the door one morning.
I love her so much.
Beautiful!!!!
Cute. Good for you all.
This is just awesome, I love this story.
Did anyone think that grandpa was just standing next to two cardboard cutouts of his wife and granddaughter?
Very cute. But the real question is: Why do you hate ducks?
My wife always wonders why I'm so nice to her grandma. I didn't really know my paternal grandparents, and I was pretty much estranged from maternal grandparents through my parent's divorce. I even missed my grandma's funeral (which I heard was a shit-show anyway due to arguing). Anyway, I wish I were old enough and financially-able to help them when they were alive. So now I do all I can for my wife's grandma now.
That‚Äôs great and all, but why does Jill hate ducks?
Shoes in the house AND on carpet!? Oh lord, forgive them for they do not know üò©
I wish more than most anything that my grandma was still alive to move in with. I miss her so much, every day. It‚Äôs been nineteen years since I lost her and my heart is still shattered. I love you, grandma.
This is so cute and wholesome!
Damn wish I this with my grandparents. Cherish it OP. You all look very happy
So pure.  Makes me wish my grandparents were still around.

I wish you all a happy holiday season, and may you spend many more together!
Where did you get those tights!!!
This is wonderful!
What an Awesome picture

Bless this dream team!
And you do enough smiling for the three of you
Good you will be a great help for them in this age, as one grows physically weak it's impossible to do certain things after sometime, no matter how much willpower one has.

Have a fun Christmas.
Love the hats :) hope you all have a great Christmas:)


But Jill why the duck hate?
Beautiful family!
Your grandparents are lucky to have you as their granddaughter! This is so sweet.
I love how they're holding hands
Why do you hate ducks?
Great pants!
I love this so much! My grandparents were the the very best people in my life, I wish I had had the chance to live with them. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday!
I love this so much! My grandparents were the the very best people in my life, I wish I had had the chance to live with them. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday!
Enjoy minute you have with them. Grand parents are the best. Even when they are difficult people. Those will be some of the defining moments in your life.
I bet you get the best home cooked meals.
Great pants!
so wholesome.  

there's hope for humanity yet.
Oh so cute! Love your Christmas leggings. What a sweet photo . Grandparents are the best. I chose to live with mine when things got a bit rocky with my family and it was a great decision. I can totally sense the love in this photo.
this is so wholesome i almost cried
üíñüíñ
Can she make me a chocolate chip cookie? I need that in my life please.
Family without drama. So sweet!
Can‚Äôt love this enough!!
I just moved in next door to mine. It's been nice to create new memories now that I'm out of college.
And that‚Äôs all it takes to have an efficient team! Congrats lol but really it‚Äôs so cute and I‚Äôm so happy for you guys to have such an awesome relationship ‚ù§Ô∏è
Quality content!!
Grandpa is a pilot?
Thank you so much for all that your doing for your grandparents! My grandfathers memory isn't the same as it used to be and my grandmother cant do everything herself, so Ive done the same and moved in with them for tech support and heavy lifting. Godspeed and keep up the good work!
I hope y‚Äôall having a good time
Y‚Äôall are lovely. Seasons greetings!
So wholesome , love this.
My mom died recently. I feel your pain.

I‚Äôm glad to see you love your grandparents enough to take on that responsibility for them. It‚Äôs a great sacrifice that you will feel good about for the rest of your life.
man, I love this! thank you for posting this, it's super heartwarming.
There goes another elf
Thank you for sharing this and loving your grandparents. I am sure they love you very much.
I miss my grandparents.  This makes me smile. Enjoy this.
But why do you hate ducks, Jill?
This made my heart happy.
I know others would have said this but this is seriously **Awesome!!!**
I love those tights. I want them. What a cute family. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Awhh so precious & cute, I wish I knew my grandparents & were this close with them
That‚Äôs so cute! And good for you helping out your grandparents!
This is so sweet. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday season!!
That is an adorable picture.
Enjoy your grandparents! They seem like wonderful people.
This is really heartwarming! What a fun crew.
Adorable
Merry Christmas to your family! :)
This is the most heart warming thing I have ever seen. I know they love having their baby girl around ‚ù§Ô∏è
Happy Holidays!
Best holiday wishes to you and your family!
‚ÄòGrandma does literally everything else‚Äô lmao this tickled me for some reason.
I respect you a lot!!! I currently live with my grandparents and they are just the greatest people ever. I love them so much and always encourage me to do what I want in life. Grandparents are just the greatest <3
You all look very nice
They‚Äôre holding hands ü•∞
I miss my grandmas so much! Enjoy them. Looks like you three are a great team. And a lot of love there too. So beautiful!
Sounds like a great team! Best wishes and happy holidays to you all!
My favorite part is the way even after all those years, your grandfather is still reaching for your grandmothers hand.
This is the cutest thing! It is so sweet that you are living with them! I love Grandparents!
This is so weird haha. We're both from Texas and your grandparents also look exactly like mine. So much that when I was browsing this sub I scrolled past this pic and thought to myself "wait are those my grandparents?!?" lol
I did this for my mom and dad. Some other relatives helped, but it‚Äôs still a lot of work.

It‚Äôs not easy. You are better than most people! God bless you !
Wow you all look so happy ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love your leggings!

 Give your grandparents a hug from me. I just lost my gran recently and even though I know she isn't in pain anymore I still miss her :(
I love your pants
So cute
How lovely !!!
Love the Christmas themed leggings.
So, what's your deal with Ducks, huh Jill?
This is a beautiful Christmas card picture!
Lucky to have eachother
I lost my grandmother last year around this time and one of the things I regret is not taking enough pictures. Keep enjoying the family time which looks and sounds awesome.
Great looking family! Have a great holiday season
I would like a card please
Fucking love this picture!
This was me with my grandparents when I was in college and grad school. Best memories ever.
This is awesome! So cute. Enjoy the time you have with them. I miss my grandparents quite a bit.
Someday in my life, i hope my only responsibility is to get the mail.
What an awesome situation and will be some of the most cherished times of your life. Merry Christmas!
I think you are cute
This is how you become the best version of yourself. Bravo!
I miss my grandparents
#squadgoals
Solid team.
I NEED those leggings
Pretty sure that same wood paneling is in every grandparents house in the US
Divine
My grandma, grandpa and my father passed away whem I was 2 years old. I feel so happy for you, if you see this give them a hug from a stranger on the internet :).
So sweet! I love this. I lost my grandma earlier this year and it‚Äôs coming up on one year since we got the cancer diagnosis. This makes me miss her immensely.
Are they holding hands?
My grandma‚Äôs house has the same paneling!
How adorable!
A lot of older people hate having to move out of their homes but it gets too hard for them to maintain their properties or do a lot of stuff on their own. Having grandkids or kids move in is a great win/win situation for people on budgets. I love this. :)
An early merry xmas to you and your grandparents
You are all so cute!!!  This was a lovely post.
I love that he‚Äôs holding her hand. üòä
This is so sweet and it reminds me so much of my dad‚Äôs family. You guys are adorable.
Merry Christmas to y'all!
I love this a lot. So crazy sweet.
So wholesome! I know you're probably underappreciated but to me you're the best!
The spirit of Christmas,when you spend your time with your family..
Idk but the fact that they are holding hands melted me.  üíûüíû
You guys are adorable!
That's an awesome photo for the cards! All the memories you're making will be worth it!
What does your grandma cook that blows your mind? I learned all my cooking secrets from my gram. I'll appreciate that forever!
Grandpa knows what's up.
This is tremendous. My heart üíì
You all look so festive!!  Love your leggings and your Gram‚Äôs little hat!  Just noticed your grandparents are holding hands. That is so sweet (I teared up a little) !   Best wishes for a wonderful holiday season!  ‚ù§Ô∏è from Florida
This picture(as well as each one of you) is super freaking cute, lol definitely made me awwwww 11/10 would awwww again lol
Wow. I‚Äôm married and have a house and my grandparents have passed away, but in another life I would have loved to have lived with them at my current age. It‚Äôs a bummer to think that many of the years I got to spend with my grandparents I was too young to care deeply about them.
What a blessing to have this time with them. Something I've never really had with mine. I'm so happy for you, you're the cutest family ever.
Treasure the life. Classic photo. X
Dang. This feels so "home-y". It's giving me nostalgia for some reason. I'm not you and those aren't my grandparents.
Ahhhh!! This is amazing. Now I have to go dig out pics of Thanksgiving and Christmas with my grandparents. Mine were kinda the opposite - meaning that my grandmother had dementia and my grandfather did just about everything.
I wish I had this kind of relation ship with my grandparents :(
I‚Äôd marry you.
So awesome to be making memories you‚Äôll cherish forever.  I know they love having you there!
Mary Christmas!
This is really sweet. I love that you're able to help and be with them, something special about grandparents. My Nanny passed away last year right before Christmas, and it hasn't been the same without her. I miss her so much and still can't believe she's really gone. Cherish these moments and time with themüòä
Those are some happening leggings.
How cute, and damn you can move in with me any day lol
Why does Jill hate ducks?
Also, this is adorable.
Adorable, I hope to live in Multi generational home one day.  You're living the dream!!
You're adorable! I'm glad you are all happy together
That looks like the quintessential grandparents house.
Not all heroes wear capes, some wear elfs‚Äô hats.
Shit this is awesome
Sorry. I am literally touched by this post.üòå
I love your pants! They are electric!
 Nice pants
This!!!! is a good reason to ‚Äúmove back home‚Äù.
This is how a family should support each other, if they can, if they want.
You make a beautiful family OP, thank you for sharing.
Your grandmother is gorgeous. I hope to look that good of I ever get her age.
You guys look lije a fun bunch. May i ask why you moved in with them? Is it a financial issue or do they need care & assistance? Or both? Or just for the heck of it?
Just putting this out there you are very cute
The internet loves you. I love you.
Your grandma is B-E-A-U-T ! Let her know that when grandpa is around ... Hope you have a wonderful time !
Awesome!
Niceee
Cutest holiday card ever! Well done for your initiative ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
You're a good person
You're lucky to get a chance to live with them! Look at them holding hands! :D
I absolutely love this. I grew up with my grandparents from 1 and a half years old. My parents weren't exactly solid. Anyway, my grandparents have always been my rock and with my grandma passing away this year, I gotta hold on extra tight to my grandpa. Brought some joy to my season, thank you.
Op is a saint

Aww your grandpa holding your grandma's hand. That's wholesome!
This. This is so beautiful.
How much do you pay for rent?
Welcome to r/popular lol
You're pretty cute
I'm sorry but I have to ask .. why do people in USA have shoes on inside? - also, they may not actually be American, but it's just a stereotype I've heard alot of tlmes and I never got a real answer
Do the fucking dishes
The picture looks photoshoped.
That long ass title tho
Shut up it's still no nut november
Okay boomer
so, grandpa ain't pullin' his weight? lol
Love those pants!!
you look like a mix between Dan Howell and Michael Reeves
[deleted]
You guys look great!!!!
The hand holding! üòçü§ó
What a great team!
Win win win.
Adorable
Hug your grandma and grandpa for me, and tell them how much you love them.
I have those fleece leggings!!! Fuck yeah Aldi!

the grandpa looks so confused or he can't smile because of the teeth
This is wholesome content
WHY do you guys wear shoes inside the house??? ü§îü§îü§î
It's so lovely you're moving in with the grandparents. I know it's different in the USA from my part of the world (where generations often live together), but loneliness is common everywhere. There will be times when you feel exasperated at their stubbornness in certain issues, just be gentle and explain things as gently as you can without making them feel useless. And that's my second point - Elders hate to feel they are useless or dependent, they love it when they feel they have contributed, even if it's just to count the number of envelopes or whatever. Hope your holidays are warm and loving!
Hey emily
They look so much like cutouts in this picture
:)
Mentally ill loser stop being a mooch bum get a job and your own home
This is adorable OP, happy holidays
Sending you guys all the love in the world ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
That is very awesome üòä and heartwarming!
Sounds like fun :)
That seems to be a formidable team. I don't know whether to be impressed or intimidated by this show of force.
Wow
Nice smiles
This is the content I look for, wish u lots of luck omggg
I'm gonna print this out and put on my fridge (in a non-creepy way).
I love you guys!
Awesome. Capitalism is anti family atm
I think I might be hacked.
Nice to see the Boomers and the Gen Z getting along well.
Can I get a Christmas card? I've never gotten one ü•∫
