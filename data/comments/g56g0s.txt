“So what we looking at here?”
I'm too cynical to believe this isn't a trick but it's adorable anyway.
Awww they are homies
Who says you have to be a dog or cat person why not both
[removed]
Cat is about to explode
Puppy: "...awwww friend, my best friend ever, you look like you need a little hug right at this moment. I will stay with you as long as you need".

Cat: "Do you FUCKIN' see my tail moving! HUH! DO YOU? I KNOW you know what that means. 10 seconds...that's all you have. 10 SECONDS!"
Straight out of a disney movie
Well, here we go. Dogs putting their paw on another animal is a show of domination. Not necessarily aggressive, but not the super cuddly stuff you think you're looking at. The cat's tail is wagging way too fast, it's definitely pissed off and about to slap that dog.
The cat is not happy
/u/vredditdownloader
"It feels like a long time, but don't worry - hooman will be back soon"
Isn't that a dominance move by the dog. I know when when some other dog at the park tries that with my pup. My boy does not take to kindly to that
u/vredditdownloader
"don't let them bullies bother you, I'm here for you friend"
The cat's about to slap the fuck out of that dog
Don’t cats wag their tails when they are upset? Lol
Don't quote me, but I feel like I read somewhere that cat tails only move like that when they are agitated lol.
Cat is a bit nervous tho. 
This reminds me when I am angry at my boyfriend and he still sits next to me and hugs me. I like it, but I am still nervous.
That cat is NOT HAPPY
I like how the cat genuinely looks like it's annoyed but doesn't do anything.
Judging by the cats tail, I think this one is at least half real. That cat really does like that pup
i'm pretty sure when cats swing their tails it means they are angry
As optimistic as I can be, that cat tail wag was an indication that only 2 more seconds would be tolerated before all of this feline’s aggression would be unleashed upon this poor, unsuspecting canine.
I concur.
That cat, is about 2 seconds, from unleashing hell, on that dog. Just say'n.
This is so sweet, I now have diabetes.
Watched video... can confirm.

That cat's tail is still twitching... Expect claws in dog snoot shortly after video cuts off.
Bruh WTF, I hate democracy xD

[Link to same video I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/fdxb4w/lets_gaze_out_of_the_window_together/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
I would upvote this video 43,792 times if I could.  LOVE.
That’s cat’s tail is telling me a whole different tale.
I agree.
I bought coins just for this
*In Morgan Freemans voice

And thus began the peace for which both the Felines and Canines had so desperately fought over for eons. A war which begun so easily, was thus ended so equally. But both sides entered this fragile peace knowing full well, that peace is a fragile thing, and that they needed to deny their inner most nature, millennia of hatred and instinct, in order to maintain it. This is the story of that peace, and the struggle to maintain it.
I’m usually a sadist, but this video made me a happys real quick.
This one sparks joy
MY GAWD! Impressive. Take my upvote!
Awesome, cuteness!
Their tails just need to hug
This post still needs more upvote!
Who said dogs and cats can't be friends.
This absolutely beats Schmiddywarbenyankermamjemsen, who was #1.
That is the tail-twitch of an exasperated cat lol
That's one pissed off cat.
It warms my heart to see them as very good buds:’)
Awwww
adorable :) 

so, I am fairly new to the cat business and my cat is twitching his tail a lot like this cat. can anybody translate what it means? the cat in the video obviously is not upset but watching something. I have a hard time interpreting because to me twitching tail meant angry so far.

the cat I got is 8 years old and was not very pleased to change the owner, sorry servant. so I had a lot of angry twitching in the beginning but he is doing it a lot although he seems to have accustomed to his new home after 3 weeks. just never knew a cat with that unstable of a tail so far. anybody got some opinions on this? asking for my cat friend
Dog: "I miss master, I hope he is okay!"

Cat: "Our slave is late."
Dog: you are my best friend, I want to be right next to you and look at what you're looking at forever 

Cat: you're annoying but I suppose I will tolerate you.
Cat is agitated, says the tail
That tail tells a different story... lol.
But still a beautiful sight.
Cat: come up here, fool.  
Puppy: whoa this so much better, mate.  
Cat: told you. now let's watch these stupid fuckers protest the lockdown by spreading the virus.  
Puppy: at least their dogs won't get it.  
Cat:  I got 9 nine lives...
isn’t that the tail signal of the cat is showing it is annoyed?
[deleted]
People let me tell you 'bout my best friend! 🎵
The cat merely tolerates the pupper
That cats not happy
Cat looks pissed...
Oh my GOSH. Sometimes my dogs sleep with their heads on each other's butts, and I thought that was cute, but this is on another level.
This is the kind of odd, weird friendship I need in my life.
If their tails curled together my life would be complete
If u look at them through the window you’ll see the pet Co logo
I agree. That is all
>The greatest video ever. That is all

Alright thems some pretty big words 

*clicks*

>Repost 

I don't know what i expected
No video filmed vertically will ever be the greatest.
How indecent of you to spy on a cute couple
this is some homeward bound shit right here
Its like the guy who is good with everyone he knows and the guy who hates everyone he knows get along well and are good buddies.
This is straight out of a Pixar movie and you can't convince me otherwise.
Mine do this, but not nearly as cute. They just enjoy bird watching together.
Sometimes we find friendship in the craziest places.
When's the movie with Ashton Kutcher, and Jennifer Lawrence as voice overs for the cat, and dog come out?
This is just a example of bros being bros.

I (we :S) have a black cat too, that dog was in serious trouble if he/she did that to mine.  
I can't even touch him sometimes, damn crazy cat.
That’s not how I expected that video to go.
Gonna tell my kids this was Good Omens

I thought the dog was gonna have the cat's tail slapping his face then I realized it's /r/aww
I didn't believe the title, but I also can't argue against it
Super adorable!
That last line was a joke...
*southern accent* I hereby declare this the greatest video we have ever seen in these United States. Not only is the cuteness level beyond, but teaches us life lessons as well. That is all.
This is what Disney movies are made from
You’ve got a friend in me
I though the dog was gonna push off the cat at the end
Reddit taught me to expect...i've been tricked, backstabbed...and quite possibly bamboozled

Ahhh if only their tails had wagged in sync that would have been the icing on the cake !
Maybe if not vertical
Can someone tell me about the cats tail is it happy or annoyed?
That cat is annoyed.
That made me smile. Thank you
i was really expecting the dog to push the cat
I want someone to hug me like that while I sip some tea haha ><

And that I have friends.

Thats not the case.
That cat is so stiff.
This is making me miss the homies
BROOOOOOOO. THIS IS SO FUCKING CUTEE
“You got a friend in me” starts playing *
This is just pure, unconditional friendship.
*What are we looking at?*

**Shutup**
Who else was waiting for the cat to sabotage the poor dog?
 While friendship is indeed an instrument – for the good and for  spiritual growth, we recognize in interreligious friendship more than  the instrumental relationship

Isn't it a gesture to assert dominance from the dog?
So cute bff
Cat thinks the dog is just a weird cat lol

And yet through all the mayhem of 2020, small slivers of moments when one could take a breath and enjoy a nice little video of two friends enjoying the scenery together appeared every so often.
"When you're the best of friends"
The old cartoons always show cats and dogs as mortal enemies and could never get along. This video shows otherwise.
I want these 2 crazy kids to have long happy lives with each other

Ahhh this bought a smile to my face good start to the day
This happened once with my dog and cat, except my cat started licking the dogs balls and then my uncles. It was sooooooo hot
Is the cat a little confused about what he saw? I wonder why the dog wasn't embarrassed then? Maybe the cat saw another cat on its territory, and the dog does not care?
Is that Dobby?
awwwwwwwww

Interesting how many cat people are here. first thing I thought was how  much shit that dog was trying to start by putting his paw on top of the  cat like that. in dog lingo, ridiculously antagonizing. two way street
Hanging with his support bro.
Cat dog best friend forever
Look at all the things to pee on.
I love how the cat at first is agitated because you can see their tail swishing, but it gradually slows down and accepts it. Fuck, that's so cute.
This is against nature. This may be the reason for all the apocalyptic events that are happening. Brace yourself people.
Humans are animals; animals are just animals.
That cats mad. Not cute. That dog is bugging the cat
Friendly up every thing
Why's the cat wagging it's tail instead of the dog? What kind of sorcery is this? Is this a trick of some sort?

He was gonna hump

You are correct!!!!!!

That's a pretty annoyed tail wag
This makes a grown man cry
I totally though the dog was going to start humping the cat.
So cute. Your pets are grate. Very nice pup protecting friend the kitty.
And then they fricked
That is such an heart warming video. Thank you
ADORABLE!!!
Dobby?
It really is a great video of two best buds
Cut to soon, dog was about to taste some claws

This video was taken after the great Feline-Canine War ended. Animosity lingered between the two nations for many years, but time heals all wounds. Now, generations later, cats and dogs can finally just be friends.

This is getting ridiculous.  Even the cat has a comfort dog.

Have to believe the cat the setting up the dog to push him out the (tenth floor) window.
Well their tails aren't forming a heart, so it's not that good of a video. :P

Title is  accurate.
Aww it's April and Andy!
Cat owners know that cat is annoyed.
That cat is not happy about this situation.
I hate to write this, but dogs wag their tails when they are happy but cats wag their tails when they are angry or irritated.
That kitty tail tells a different story...
I feel like I’m the cat. Like, hey, thanks for the friendship. Now fuck off.
That is not happy tail from kitty.
So cute 😍

Watched till the end so I could see them link tails. A bit disappointed.
Anyone thinking this is an angry cat tail doesn't know about tail hugs.

E: *wow* a lot of y'all don't know about tail hugs.    
Protip: if you've never gotten one it's because *you're not worthy.*
