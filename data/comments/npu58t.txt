If that's all you have to go through for that then that cat needs some huge rewards.
Not sure if this was cooperation or flashbacks.
That‚Äôs amazing!! My cat turns into the Tasmanian devil  when I come at him with a syringe of meds.
‚Äúohhhh fine just do it quick‚Äù -that cat probably
First time I had to give my kitten medicine and she did just that I was horrified. I thought I broke her. Thanks for the adorable confirmation that my kitten is fine!
Some say that cat is still mleming to this day.
When just the thought of the medicine makes you taste it and gag
We have to wear Kevlar gloves to give our cat his meds.
Knows the best way to get down that stuff down.
I have to hold my baby in a fuzzy sack so she can't claw the shit out of me when I give her her antibiotics.
growing up my mother, an RN for atleast 20+ years has told me, "you should go in the medical field youre so caring you'd do great"  
BUT ----  every pet ive ever had to do anything like this to i do choking back tears cuz im afraid im hurting my furbaby and im afraid they will no longer love me and grow to resent me.  


  
i am a 30 year old man with a wife and kid.
What a good kitty!
How?
Sometimes we need 3 ppl to give my cat some medication.
I would pay good money to understand what's going on in that cats head at that exact moment. Someone invent a cat thought to human speech machine please.
Pavlov's cat.
Fofinha! ü•∞
What language is she speaking? It feels like I should know it (I speak Italian as a second language, and can grasp some Spanish), but it just feels off somehow. Am I having a stroke or something?
I had a diabetic cat who passed in 2019. I used to put him on my coffee table and give him a teaspoon of wet food to distract him while I gave him his insulin. He learned immediately that when I got out the syringes, he was getting wet food, so he‚Äôd run to the coffee table and wait for me. <3
My oldest cat (going on 17) has always had a very distinct attitude.  Without any malice, he will make it very clear with bites and scratches if you try anything he doesn't like.  He's a sweetie, and loves every human, but don't cross him.  He went into kidney failure a year ago but thanks to giving him Sub-Q fluids every three days, he's still with us.  The first six months were a horror.  I had to armor myself with multiple jackets, including a hood protecting my ears after one bloody bit of cat revenge, while my SO (he's a nurse) injected the fluids.  And then he just calmed the heck down and let us do it.    


One day, total evil...the next, calm cat.
Better than my cat! Liquid or pills even with copious amounts of treats, he spits meds everywhere!
I've never seen a cat this well behaved!
Translation:

Let's take the meds?

*Purr*

Good! Let's take the meds? Hmm?

This one... Well done! Now the other one. Well done! Cutie!
Oh shit, here we go again
I had a cat that would take a pill without a problem.  You would just put it down in front of him or in your hand  and he'd take it without issue.  Only cat I've ever seen so this consistently.  Unfortunately he died very young with FIP.
That is not a cat. It may look like a cat, but that is not a cat.

I should upload a video what it takes to give my cat meds. The first thing I'm carrying is an emergency supply of my own blood, and that's just for starters as those terrifying claws cut through chain mail like it was made of paper.

This after chasing the basterd around the house for 30 minutes, finding spots I didn't know we had in the house.

Tuna flavor my ass.
If you look closely, the guy (or someone else) appears to be rubbing the cat's "licking spot" prior to giving it medicine. At the base of some cats' tails is a super sensitive spot that, when rubbed, causes them to start licking and meowing uncontrollably. Not all cats respond in this way or even react at all.
What a cooperative kitty! Mine tries to run and hide every time I ask my daughter hold her so I can ‚Äúdose‚Äù her. She pathetically creeps under the bed or heads for the basement door. She definitely knows when it‚Äôs coming! She‚Äôs not impressed by the chicken flavor they add.
Had a diabetic kitty who would run to the kitchen when you said "medicine time" and he'd crouch down for his injection.  Of course he got a treat afterwards. Same when I checked his glucose level.  Just sat there purring away as I poked at his ear.  He never gave me any trouble with any kind of medicine, right up to the end.  I miss that dude so much.
Of course he is happy, all she does is say "let's do drugs?"

On a loose translation
I have to wrap my cat in a blanket and sit with my legs around him on the floor to give him meds. And he‚Äôs a lap cat who loves cuddles. But not when there‚Äôs meds involved!
My cat had to get a pain medicine via syringe.  The first 2 he was not happy. 3&4 he knew what was up and was kinda looking at me like.  Hey how bout some more of that feel good juice.
when I was watching my moms puppy she was on like a pill for something at the time (I don‚Äôt remember what, an antibiotic I think?) she told me to wrap it in cheese to trick her to eat it 

When I was preparing it I dropped it on the floor on accident and she just licked it up.....

Then the next day I just went up to her and put the pill on the ground and she vacuumed it up.....
as someone that needs to deliver liquid gabapentin to their cat every night, this is absolutely incredible.
My cat needs pills often and she's learned that that pill is going in no matter what, so she might as well just eat it.
But what were the chances that the cat speaks Portuguese..? I'm amazed.
I wish I could achieve this. I have to wrangle my 15 yo cat to give her her meds.  We both HATE it. I feel mean, she doesn't trust me for like 24 hrs after :( .
I wish all cat's were this easy! My Mom's cat will hide for a week after getting one syringe of medicine. üòù
It looked like he had to rev the engine to prepare for that.
Jeez what a smart cat. I'm always blown away by how intelligent pets can be.

Poor lil fella!  My cat broke his foot a few years ago, and had I to give him liquid pain killers every 8 hours.  At first it was a struggle, but eventually I think he got hooked on them cause he‚Äôd anxiously limp over to my for it when I brought out the bottle.
Once I had to give my cat a pill and I was trying to think of a way to get it into him. So I put it on the counter and stepped away and he walked over to it and ate it.

Aww‚ù§Ô∏è pretty sad is that my first guinea pig died because he dint want to eat medicine
I WISH my Yorkie was so cooperative with his oral meds
I wish my budgie would do this.  He screams and runs away frantically trying to hide. üò≠
I have never in my life had my cat agree to give oral meds like this. It usually takes a purrito and excessive fighting.
Good kitty.
They must put some sort of flavoring in them because when my cat had surgery and needed antibiotics and painkillers she loved the medicine.
I wish mine was this cooperative.  It's a small chase every morning, even though he knows he gets treats afterwards.
My cat surprisingly adapted well to medicine. He hated it at first but by the end it was so easy.

Wow, that is a remarkable level of trust for a cat. That lady should be really proud of her achievement at bonding with that cat. I've known loving cats and owners but few would be as patient as that good girl kitty.
I can't even bring out the flea drops, unopened, without my cat acting like he has smelled the most offensive smell in the universe. *I literally have to open it in a different room*
That‚Äôs how I look when I drink my coffee when it‚Äôs too hot.

Aww! Good kitty deserves good kitty pets
Such a great cat, very impressive. I‚Äôve never had a cat that took medicine like that
Kitty after the two doses: "Hey can i stop now? Tell me when"
My cat drops copious amounts of drool for 20 minutes, if she even gets a hint of the taste of her medicine.
How can I save this video? THIS LOOKS SO FRICKING CUTE
My 16 year old cat has figured out that I believe she'll swallowed her pill after 3-5 seconds. I'll come back to her bed a few minutes later and see she spat it out and sat on it. She's an old bitch, but I still love her.
This is obviously fake. No scratching, no blood, no medicine puked on every soft surface of the house (carefully avoiding wipeable surfaces.) I don't believe this is real.
If only my cat was this compliant! Every time I have to give him meds, I'm worried one of us is going to be seriously injured. üò™
I can just hear her now ‚ÄúOh here we go again‚Äù
Can relate. My cat needs her kidney medication every day. She takes it nice but not as expertly as this kitten :)
I love kitty
I used to give my cat Ranitidine for his upset tummy, and he lapped it up happily. So, when the vet said we had to give him Atopica for a skin condition I thought ‚Äúno problem‚Äù. 

Nope, no way, not a fucking chance! 

That stuff must have tasted like the arse of a 3 month dead rat because he resisted it at every turn. Even at one point learning to keep it in his mouth then spit it out as soon as you let go. Put it in his food? He could smell it a mile off. Mix it with a strong flavoured treat, nope. Ended up just being a headlock and forced to take it, then holding his little mouth until he swallowed. I really didn‚Äôt enjoy doing that. 

When I actually had to start injecting him with insulin every 12hrs (as a result of steroid treatments), he would lie down, and would even purr as the syringe went in. 

But Atopica? Nope.
How?????
I lost my best friend freedom to cancer. When I gave her meds she would do this but she would twist and turn. Even the purrito method was rough. Really miss her a lot.
What a good baby!
lucky bastard. my cat has kitty asthma and just got prescribed an inhaler..... i don't see this going well :-(
What sorcery is this?! I've been giving my cat pills daily for years now and he still fights me every time. Spits it out every time.

How?!?
My cat did this but she really loved the taste of her gross tuna flavored compounded meds
Pet the damn cat, though.
Smelly cat smelly cat what are they feeding you
Aww good kitty.
"oh yeah, gimme a second to get the mechanism working"
Am actually kinda disturbed
Animatronics are getting so life-like.
LOL, I love how kitty starts before the medicine does.
We foster lots of kittens and semiferal momma's. Iv got scars. So many scars. I wish our cats would be this easy.
I recall giving that pink shit (for the tummy) and the clear shit (for pain) to my cat in late stage renal failure.  Sub Q saline as well.  He was such a good patient.  RIP Blimpo.
My Thundercat just passed away after a battle with lymphoma. She was also grey like this kitty. This reminds me of giving her her steroids so much I could cry. Cherish the time you have with them.
That cat did better then my 4 yr old...
What a very good kitty
My kitty when saw this coming kept tilting her head in the opposite direction or flatly walked away. Needed two people to hold her and then her mouth wouldn‚Äôt open. Lol
Why are they taking that medicine? Hope theyre doing okay :)
That's just a video in reverse.
I'm sorry to say, but did that person sound like a female sim having a conversation with another sim?
My God i wish my cat was this chill when he needs meds
My cat isn't this accommodating, but ever since we forgot her steroid one day and she felt the effects of not being on them for the first time in a while she's much easier to catch on pill day
Omg please teach me your ways. I have to basically mount my cats to give them meds.
My cat's vet gave her pills that I was split in half and "hide" in her food.

 hahahahahahahahaha

I wish my cat was like this one.

My cat found where I had it in her wet food, and even after letting sit in her food for a while so it got soft , she still found it and pushed the food that had her meds in it to the side with her nose. There is no fooling my cat.

My cat pulled out a gun and held us hostage until we agreed to do things her way. The house is hers now, in exchange she doesn‚Äôt have an ulcer. True compromise
I could only hope.....I suit up in 3 layers to give my 5 lbs cat her liquid meds.

This cat is an angel.  Giving meds to my cats is a torturous and usually futile endeavor.

"VAMO TOMAR REMEDIO?" I never saw a cat liking medicines before, im scared about that
**HOW** did you **ever** get your cat to be so co-operative!?!
That cat definitely associates the syringes with feeling better from the medication. It's funny because it reminds me of when you put a dog above water and it starts paddling.
I give my cat freaking Prozac pills every day to make her stop pooping outside of the box. She used to fight me, but now I practically toss the thing into her mouth and she just takes it.

I made sure to associate taking her pill with pets and getting fed. She's a lard-ass so the motivation of impending food is plenty to make her positively associate the pill.
For all those pill givers with horror stories, try using pill capsules. 
It hides the taste and also makes things a bit more slippery.
We give a pill every evening and since we started using capsules it‚Äôs a lot less drama and stress for the cat.
I wish my kittens were this chill.  They flail like furry tornados and claw me up long before the flea meds or laxanip comes near them
I am AMAZED. AMAZED. Did your cat just start doing this on their own, or did you train them somehow? If so, HOW?
That is incredible. I have to wrap my kitty in a soft houseboat so only her head is sticking out, open her mouth, and then spritz it in. I have so many scratches from failed attempts (no bites though, no teeth!). You've got a great cat right there!
Still.....the BEST I've ever seen a cat take medicine.
Hehe stupid cat.

That cat looked traumatized,  my opinion may not represent the actual feelings of the cat just my impression.

"Oh God, oh God... ffs, Karen, just get it over with already! I have world domination to plan, toy mice to destroy... nobody's got time for this!"
My cat used to fight medicines, acting completely possessed. After a few weeks of battles something clicked and he realised the fight was worse than the medicine. He would then take tablets from the palm of your hand.
What a good girl!!!!
my cat takes prednisolone in pill form - which I'm a pro at now so I much prefer it.  Sometimes tho the vet had to give it to me in a liquid and I fucking hate shoving the syringe down my cat's throat.  She hates it more than I do and often she'll produce a shit ton of saliva and it'll like bubble out of her mouth and she'll drool everywhere.

Pill takes about 0.5 seconds to shove down her throat, usually so quick that she can go right back to sleep if she's asleep. I'm a practiced pro.

OMG! That is just awesome!

Whats that language? It sounds like Arabic but idk
Poor kitty.  My cats hate their medicine.
His face makes it look like he cant even control himself while doing it lol
Do they have a sardine-flavoured medicine?
Sweet baby ‚ù§Ô∏è
HOW?!?

Any can I've ever had to give something like that too, has fought the whole thing, and needed to be turned into a burrito before I could get the syringe into their mouth.

Aww even though he didn‚Äôt do this, I‚Äôm reminded of my old kitty Bear. He was a blue cat too, and very sick in his later years. Had to give him medicine all the time. üòî
reminds me of that guy who tried to sell me a rona vax in the street
That's a damn good cat.
poor sweet baby. i hope s/he will be ok.
What a smart Kitty
Me and my monkey
Is it that simple .. we had to give medication to our devil and all hell break loose .. my wife and I had to plan the place position and timing to get the medication done and believe me we always felt we need more hands

Gotta take your medicine one way or the other. Orally might be preferred
If only my blue russian was so well mannered like this one, mine is a fucking demon, no kidding he is like a mischievous problem kid who does anything he wants and likes to hit other cats for no reason, and I usually call him silver bastard.
What a good kitty
Awwwwww
Oh my goodness this is SO cute and funny and I have a gray boy that looks just like that
Good kittie
What a sweetie! Our Very Old Feisty Lady runs away (the best she can - she's 20 years old) and makes it impossible to give her the medicine.
What cute kitty is she a Russian Blue?

I swear, cats and compulsive behaviors. Fascinating.
What a good cat!! I'd have been cut to shreads giving my cat medicine. I have past scars to proof it.
My puppy also does this phantom swallowing for her meds! She definitely doesn‚Äôt love it but so happy she cooperates.
My cat loved getting her meds, she would lick the stick afterwards as well haha
"Boys will be Boys"
You are a cat Jedi. Truly impressive!
HUE HUE BR
Wow textbook Pavlovian response
Aww bless its soul. That was an instant flashback back and you can tell that baby is thinking, "here comes that nasty ish."
This made laugh way more than it should have lmao!

Pretty much how it goes when giving anything to cats hahaha
Why does she speak in the language of Hollow Knight?
Good kitty
This bitch has 4M karma

Lol. My cat knows the drill too, except for us the drill is a SQ injection in his neck skin. He knows when it's time and turns into a furry little football. Pulls his neck way back and hides all his limbs. Makes it a giant pain in the ass to stick him, but it's kind of adorable
My cat does this if you scratch her at the base of her tail
Wish my children would do this üôÑ

POOR baby!  I had to do that with my cat for about 6 months...she NEVER got used to it.  Her kidneys died on her and then she finally died...she was 16.  I miss her so much!
What language is this?
Niceeee
tell your cat he can chill
Can we trade cats? Mine hears the pill bottle and runs full speed away from me.
Maybe the meds are because the cat does that.
Ain q coisinha mais linda
Awwww yeeeeesssssss gimmeee gimme gimmeee those sweeeeeet ass drugggssss.

Before my cat died from kidney failure I had to give him iv fluids I swear he was enjoying it
Kitty broken
I hope the cat is faking it, otherwise it may be an indicator of neurological damage.

Im the same with wingstop ranch. Syringe and everything
That's hilarious üòÇ I thought it was going to be a reversed video at first, until NOPE, the syringes actually do empty into his mouth. What a goofball!
What a good kitty!
Hes kinda like NOOOOOOO
Lol, this is soo great!
This made me laugh. Leave it to Reddit
I need that sweet kitters to instruct mine!

At least she swallowed it, such a good girl. Our girl would drool like a saint Bernard for a long time after getting her meds, (pills or liquids) and just make the biggest mess.
"Vamo tomar rem√©dio?". Ao som dessas palavras meus cachorros j√° estariam a 2 km de dist√¢ncia usando uma capa da invisibilidade, meus parab√©ns pra coragem da sua gata kkkk

What a goodest kitty !
Got a 20-year old gentleman who loooks just like your cat, and I wish giving him his kidney pills was half this easy. Gotta sneak up on him when he's sleeping, wrench his jaws open, then drop the pill in. Pretty rude, if you ask me.
Looks like PTSD to me

And why did she not get a treat after? (Something I say after almost every cute animal clip on this site.)
This is too cute.

If you have a hard time with liquid meds or pills, ask if they can make a transdermal ear gel.  That works great.

I wish my cat was this accepting when he's given the meds THAT HELP HIM LIVE smh
Wow! Impressive!!!
I wish my dog was that cooperative. She had to get a battery of tests for stomach issues and was put on pills and liquid meds. If you‚Äôve never had to hold down a lab/boxer mix (even at half strength) you are missing out on nothing. It became the running joke that her sheer hatred of meds is what got her back to full strength so quick.
I have to wrap my cat in a towel like a cat taco to give medicine, and still only get about 50% in
The little darling!!!!
I feel like cats of this breed are super super chill. My buddy has one same color, that like off black, shade of grey and she is literally the most polite obediant cat ever. Yeah she gets into mischief but she's super sweet and you can pretty much do anything with her and she just loves the attention.

Almost acts like a dog too, they take her on walks with a leash.
Ugh I wish my cat was this easy
Best. Kitty. Ever
This lady does not know how she good she has it. Fuck. My cat won't let me do it without some blood sweat and tears.
Portuguese! O gato intende bem!
Such a good kitty. I hate having to give them medicine.
My cats take off running when I grab even my medicine bottles. They hate taking medicine.
That‚Äôs a well behaved and cooperative cat.
... And here I have to slip meds into babyfood like some weird, bad date. 

It works though, in our house babyfood is met with joy and suspicion.
When I go to the cupboard where my little dogs medicine is kept she gets up and runs to hide!
My dog has to take pills every morning and my dad has to open his mouth and put the pills in his mouth. My dog sits there and let's My dad do it because he always gets like 3 treats after it's done

I still can‚Äôt bear the taste of my meds, this cat, however, can.
I cant believe she didn‚Äôt run away
I just love this!!! I wish my kitty would take her meds like this!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I love that even thought I can‚Äôt understand the language (I think it‚Äôs Portuguese?) that the inflections of talking to your cat sound the same.

What a good kitty omg
Wow. Unbelievable.  I have two genetically feral cats and would have to trap them and put them in a towel to do that.  They have convinced me to never house another cat.  At 16 years old this has been a long haul with two basically wild animals in the house who no one can touch or look at except me and only if I meet their exhausting list of exacting demands of how to pet them, and any little noise or waft of air will cause them to panic and do a giant cat claw burn out on my leg.  They can only go to the vet for emergencies.  They have been spayed and one hat a foot abcess. 

The vet doesn't want to deal with them either.  Literally one vet visit in their life and they are totally healthy at 16.
