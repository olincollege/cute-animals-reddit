That‚Äôs what mine did! Asked to take him out to the play yard at the shelter so I could see how his personality was. It was a long walk through said shelter, and he stopped every 3 feet to turn around (the shelter worker had him on a leash) to make sure I was still following him. As soon as I got him outside, this gargantuan shepherd/rottie mix just flopped over in my lap and I rubbed his belly. You go to the shelter thinking you‚Äôre going to pick out a dog, but you don‚Äôt realize that they pick you. As soon as I saw his floppy tongue, I knew he was mine forever. I love that dumb dog so much. 
PSA: if you are looking to adopt from a shelter, please PLEASE don't overlook the more retiring animals. They may be stressed, sad or tired and look boring in their cage, but if you can take them to a different room away from the others you may see a totally different animal. :3

Edit: I appreciate the gold! 
Awwwww so happy! Her (His?) little face broke my heart in the beginning :( Thank you for giving her a forever home!
Omg these remind me never to take my pup for granted. Just called him over for some tummy rubs! 
‚ÄúIn the arms of an angel...‚Äù *record scratch* ‚ÄúImagine me and you...‚Äù
For a pet, getting adopted must feel like winning the lottery to us humans.
What a change in demeanour!! So cute!!
One of my worst memories as a kid was school trips to volunteer at an animal shelter. We'd each walk a dog for a few hours around the park and some side streets.  I remember the absolute joy those dogs had telegraphed in barks and physical acts, and the sorrow and disappointment that same dog showed once they realized I was walking them back to the kennel and not home.

Almost 20 years later I still think about it. I know that the walks they had brought joy into their life, but was it really enough to offset their going back to the cage after? Did they ever find a forever home? Or did they live out their life in a series of hope and fun, and despair and lonliness?

Think about it the next time you buy a dog from a breeder, and not a shelter. I'm on my 7th shelter dog, a few at the same time, and will have many more. I hope you do too.
We adopted a 3 month old from the Humane Society in October. He's just over 6 months now and I was looking through the photos of him from the day we brought him home and it's a totally different dog.

Similar expression. Head down, quiet, cautious. Now he just runs around and barks at himself in every window and mirror in our house.

I really wish anyone getting a dog would get one from the shelter. 

They deserve a good life too its so unfair.
My lovely DIL rescued a dog like this. And every day this dog makes me so happy despite the skull cracking she gives me jumping in my bed in the mornings. I fed her boiled chicken and virginia ham today. Not too shabby. I love her very much.  She's getting old now. I see it. As I am. And I plan to spoil her for the rest of my life.

Had to do community service at an animal shelter for something very minor. 

It's the worst thing ever. Walking passed dogs cages while they clench their paw on the fence hoping they're lucky enough to *be set free from the confinement of the cage*

I said fuck that and went to work on a farm, oh and I adopted a good boi from there before I left. :)
Aweee! Yes! Dogs know when a human has saved them. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre so loyal and loving and protective.
If I had one wish, it would be that all dogs lived happy lives in a loving home. That is all. 
[deleted]
Ahh this is sweet ! Our dog came from the shelter and she was so depressed. I went and visited her 3 or 4 times before the adoption was complete (I had a young son and wanted to make sure she was okay around him) and she was pretty disinterested in me. Sort of shy. But her eyes lit up whenever a volunteer she knew was near, she had a spark and greeted the people who took care of her with joy and you could tell she was a great dog in a bad place. We brought her home and her demeanor totally changed and she‚Äôs such a happy and grateful dog. 
[deleted]
Such a happy dogo.. Good on you for adopting ! 
Such a pleasure to see a happy adoption story! (I'm pretty tired of all the purebred puppies and their "proud" parents.)
It's amazing what a little love and freedom can do. That's a dog that will be forever grateful for being given a chance at a real life.
I WISH I COULD TAKE THEM ALL HOME!!!!!
This made me cry. I use to work at a county animal shelter and people like you are why I still have some faith in humanity. Thank you so much for adopting this puppers (to whoever adopts from shelters)! They all deserve forever homes. ‚ù§

Edit to add: You saved him. This dog will be the best friend you ever had. 
People need to get their dogs neutered and spayed. 
People who buy puppies for Chritmas only to abandon them 2 months down the track should get locked up and made to feel like worthless slime..
I would expect it to be a little bit cautious after 30 min. But this warms my heart.
Makes me cry happy tears!!!! üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è
I wish I could upvote this 1000 times. This is why I rescued. This is why people need to rescue. Dogs are not themselves being cooped up in a 4x4 cell surrounded by constant noise. They have incredible personalities despite how they may act in a kennel. If anything, rescues are MORE appreciative and you can genuinely recognize the love 

I'm on a miserable business trip I didn't agree to for a company that has the communication skills of a drunk special needs toddler with a head injury sitting in a hotel room three miles away from where my contact said it was supposed to be and this? This video put a ***HUGE*** smile on my face!
All dogs deserve the 30 minutes after being adopted shot
I'm currently waiting to pick up a rescue in a few days after finally owning a home. Might get another soon as well.

After being to the shelter several times, it's heartbreaking to see so many of the sweetest and wonderful animals not having a loving home. 

Please please try visiting your local shelter if you're looking for a pet. There is just so much love these guys have to give.
One of the best feelings in the world is bringing home an animal from the shelter. They KNOW you rescued them and they are forever thankful.
I can't say this enough: Please adopt.
No body wants to be in prison haha 
It always puts a smile on my face when people adopt rescue pets.

adopt (v.)

c. 1500, a back-formation from adoption or else from Middle French adopter (14c.) or directly from Latin adoptare "chose for oneself, take by choice, select, adopt," especially "to take into a family, adopt as a child," from ad "to" (see ad-) + optare "choose, wish, desire" (see option (n.)). Originally in English also of friends, fathers, citizens, etc. Sense of "to legally take as one's own child" and that of "to embrace, espouse" a practice, method, etc. are from c. 1600. Related: Adopted; adopting.
A pupper that is comfortable being on his back around you like that is a very good sign and special. He really trusts you right away. Take good care of him! 
I dont get how ppl can say they hate pitbulls....i dont trust those people 
This video made me, a 33 year old man, cry like a baby. The look of hopelessness while lying in the kennel, to the pure joy he experienced with his new family.... I hope he brings you just as much joy as you‚Äôve brought him. (Or her, not sure which pronoun I should be using) 
Good for you, OP! Going to the shelter is the worst. Some dogs bark, some jump at the cage doors, and then there are those who look so dejected and hopeless. I wish I could adopt every rescue and stray animal in the world.
God Bless you!! Your loving act changed the life/heart of this animal 
anddddd I'm crying
Just amazing! Makes me want to cry üíï
He was really selling it....
Thank you so much. I know that dog will tell you foe the rest of it's life, but I wanted to say it too.
Rescuing my lil hippo from the shelter has been what o considered one of the greatest moments of my life. We are building each other's confidence and trust, she is experiencing love for the first time in her life and I have opened my heart back up. Adopting or rescuing from a shelter is not for those that are not prepared for unpredictability. Everyone told me I was basically insane for rescuing a pibble, but she has proved them all wrong.
The best part is, he/she don't even know they're being adopted yet. They could just think this is a walk, imagine how happy they will be once they realize they have a forever home!
Trying to not cry. FML. I want to adopt every single dog in a shelter :( 
Both of my dogs are from animal welfare. I real think it should be illegal to breed and sell animals when there are still animals in shelters. 
I'm 6 hours into an 8 hour drive to go pick up a doggo from a family who cant keep her since she doesn't get along with a "pure blood" English Bulldog they got about a year ago. Husband said they have to get rid of her, after they got into a tiff and the lab punctured the wife's hand while she was trying to break it up. Wife got 3 tiny stitches and so now the Lab has a "bite" record and if she went to the pound she'd probably be put down.

I have been looking for another black lab for a while at my local pound and humane society, with no luck, after my doggo Sabrina passed away a few years ago after 14 years of loyal companionship. When the wife sent out an email to all the teachers at my sisters school she let her know I was interested. The wife really wants her to go to a good home so she even offered to drive her all the way to me or at least meet me half way, I don't mind the drive and my sister just moved into a new house so it gave me a reason to come see it and my grandmother who I haven't seen in a year.

I'm really hoping it all works out, she's very attached to the little girl and know it's going to to be hard on here, I'm going to meet her later today and pick her up on Saturday to drive her home on Sunday. Any advice on how to make it easier on her? 
Pibbles are some of the most handsome expressive dogs, I love them so much it scares me.
My friend went to adopt a dog. I went with. Saw a Belgian Malinois cowering in the corner. An owner had this dog for 11 years before unexpectedly dropping this dog off. (How and why!?) It was a no-kill shelter, so this old dog had remained at the shelter for over 9 months. The whole staff loved her, but no one wanted to adopt an old dog, with heart worms to boot. She looked so sad that I asked if I could take her for a walk. The moment we got into the yard, a dog jumped at her (there was a fence between) and the old dog pounced and snarled at the other dog. It was rather frightening and the dog remained stiff and unsure. She pulled at my heartstrings nonetheless. I adopted her. The staff cried, I cried. It wasn‚Äôt until we got home that she let her sweet personality out. She was such an amazing, beautiful soul. Only lived 10 more months, but I loved her as much as possible for those 10 months. Before she passed, she degraded quickly. Fully active to barely moving within a week. When I had to put her down, I REALLY cried. I was heartbroken, but I‚Äôd do it all again. 
"In the arms of an angel...Who let the dogs out!"
I love when pits smile!
This is the best.   
anytime I see these videos I have to go over to my dog and give her a big hug and snuggle. We rescued her too, although not from a shelter but a home, and she really is forever grateful. 
We weren‚Äôt even looking for a dog and it was just so meant to be and every day I‚Äôm so thankful we found her!
Thank you hooman
That is so great. God bless you. 
I love this so much! 

I adopted a shelter dog almost five years ago and it has changed my life. He is the love of my life. Seeing the change in him from the day I adopted him to now, I know I always want a shelter dog in my life. The joy he brings is immeasurable. 
My heart hurts. 
I‚Äôm in the er. Apparently I just destroyed all the joints and shit in my shoulder. The pain is unbearable. And this shit made me smile big.  Thank you. 
/r/BeforeNAfterAdoption 
Everyone should adopt.
MY HOOMAN MY HOOMAN!!!
*just another one of those dumb humans staring at me and then leaving me*

>Gets adopted

*Oh my God, you're my hero, I love you, also please don't stop rubbing my tummy. Thanks*
Adopt, don't shop. And don't breed either
Haha that‚Äôs so awesome! The pure joy and relief spewing from him is heart warming. Thanks for giving him a happy home. 
I need a subreddit for before/after shelter pets
After: I am **NEVER** getting tired of this!
All they want is love and in return they give it back 10 fold
I WISH I COULD TAKE THEM ALL HOME!!!!!


I fucking love it
So cute!! Congrats on your new pup!

My stepdad picked out our dog specifically because she seemed so docile at the pound. Imagine his chagrin when she tore around the house at lightning speed the second we got home. Love her to pieces.
That is an absolutely beautiful pit
That's a beautiful pit. My pit is currently upstairs with my mom and I've been calling for him for the last 5 minutes and he's just ignoring me. I just want to scratch his belly and tell him he's a good boy. :(
Leaned over the give my rescue pittie a big pet after seeing this touching video and he simultaneously farted directly on my leg.

The joys of dog.
dogs were literally bred to be the companions of humans. it's so gratifying to see the poor doggo finally have meaning to his life
D'awww!
Omg, my heart hurts to see that beautiful dog in the beginning and when watching him/him being truly loved by you. üò¢ amazing!!!!
Bravo. Good for you
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Awesome!!!
Heart melting
Is this in Kansas City?
This makes me so happy!! 
Watching that on a loop is like [Ralph Wiggum](https://imgur.com/gallery/Wx9mZ) with the mailbox.
You're doing god's work. Enjoy your pupper.
So happy you gave this good doggo a home! He/she is so excited 
Doggos are just amazing. 
üò≠
Omg thank you for posting this!!! So cute! My dog was just like that when I adopted her :) adopt don‚Äôt shop!! 
r/beforenafteradoption would like this!
In the blink of an eye, life changes. How wonderful!
I am so fucking happy watching this
Thank you. 
I'm losing my house I have a beautiful reverse brindle boxer of 7 years I have to give up I'm literally breaking :( 
My pup gave me the same exact look at the shelter, so happy this pup found someone to love him/her like it really deserves 
Cried.  So so happy for him!!!! Bless you and may you both have many many years of happiness!
I had this same moment/experience in 1996 when I adopted my Pittie boy from the local shelter. He was one of the best things that ever happened to me. We were a match made in heaven for 14 years. I hope you find the same joy.
I loooooove pitties! (Ok, and all other dogs) ...but owning a pit is like owning an insanely happy. yet sensitive, version of Zuul from Ghostbusters.... 
Aww I have two pound dogs, and I love this! Good on you, and good for her!
All Da yubbas for your new Furbaby! Just had to move spur of the moment and I'm trying to fight for mine. (Hubs signed a no pets lease anyway knowing that both were literally born in my lap, have 2 chronic diseases, with all associated issues including infertility and he lost a testicle to infection a few months ago) they are my ONLY chance at babies, they ARE my babies and it is killing me. Idk how he could do this to me and say he cares for them too. It's my fault, they have severe separation anxiety and after only a week my oldest baby (3 yrs) has worried a bald spot on her back close to her tail. I spewed a bunch of bullshit and bought us a few days and they are almost happy in a single room made out to be a kitty playground,  but they have always had their own room plus rub of the house and now they are back to one room and may have to go to another tiny room at my parents' and I know from a prior vacation that they can't deal. They don't eat, they lick fur bald. I'm such a bad Furbaby Mama, but I'm still so pissed at their DaddyMan I want to hit him.
Thanks for letting me rant. I'd give pics if I knew how. Xoxo, Reddit! 
Awwwww that poor sad face made me cry. 
Ima wake up and this thread will be locked in the morning 
Look at the joy! "Let's play! You guys are awesome! Can we get ice cream? Ohboyohboyohboy!"
This makes me so unbelievably happy to see. Thankyou to everyone who adopts dogs out of shelters! <3
He didn't know his life will change that hour
Adopt Don't Shop!!! 
Commit everyone you know to boycott pet stores and Class B dealers (Dog Dealers/Puppy Mills)!!! I LOVE THIS!!
Really warms the cockles of your heart!
I hate all those shelters that lock them in cages. There are cage free sanctuary/shelters/rescue places (see Cat house on the kings) - and the animals atleast live a happy life (and are all adoptable.).
there's no reason keep all the animals separate like that.
I've got 2 shelter pups.  I'm so glad this pup was adopted.  I'm always so afraid these dogs won't get adopted because of stereotypes and bad press.
Gonna go cry like can't-save-every-cat-song lady
Awesome, so glad to see people rescuing dogs in need!
It's sad then happy.    He came right to life.   I can't watch many clips like this
I'm so glad I got mine. She's my baby but she's also a handful and I used to see people return their dogs at the shelter for less and it was heartbreaking. I just keep thinking: it gets hard to handle, but I'd never give up on her. I'm so glad that I got this handful rather than someone else because Idk if my collie, pit, lab mix would do well without me running her mornings and nights. Or taking her to doggie daycare, or night hikes, or agility training. She's a great dog but a lot of time and effort. I think about someone returning a girl like her and I just feel sick. 
This is so heartwarming. <3
/r/MadeMeSmile ;)
‚ô°. the shelters in NY are nothing like this one. the dogs are kept in tiny ass cages in which they sometimes don't even have room to stand. heartbreaking 
That cutie probably only lasted 30 min at the shelter before someone took her home!
You really turned her life... Upside down.
That would be horrible, having newspaper all over the ground and sliding everywhere... :( 
If only this was people and not dogs. 
[Every time I'm watching one of these](https://media1.tenor.com/images/956b93309b412474c24eb1537637dd88/tenor.gif?itemid=7395151)
mine was sitting in a puddle of her own urine, with a sign on the door saying she was too sick to go outside. we adopted her and let her run outside with her sister. They have been in love ever since. 
Yay for thousands of years domestication 
True facts. My cat freaked the eff out all the way home when I adopted her, screaming her head off.... but, within 15 minutes of being in a warm home with comfy pillows, not surrounded by tons of other cats, she curled up, started purring like a motor boat, and gave me tons of nuzzles as if to say "thankyouthankyouthankyou"

She's been a (chatty) love bug ever since....
Thank you for adopting your dogo! Shelter dogs are the best!!!
/r/MadeMeSmile 
Getting a dog for me is going to be a long term plan as waiting for when I retire as don't really have time now. However my SO is not a dog fan so I plan on talking him into fostering as I know he'll fall in love with at least one!
When im older an have the money/time im going to spend my time adopting old dogs from shelters and caring for them until their time, i want every one to spend their last days with joy and not in a cold shelter, maybe ill adopt a puppy and an old dog so they can be friends
This made me so happy
I can't stand seeing animals suffer. :( Humans can be so cruel.
Yup that‚Äôs the spot 
You are awesome, whoever you are. 
I‚Äôve had a shitty week and this put the biggest smile on my face. Needed to see some cute ass shit.
Thank you for adopting!
This was exactly my good girl when I adopted her. Now i need to pet her
Aw man I wasn't planning on crying tonight. I'm gonna go cuddle my puppy. üò≠
What a good boy 
Thank you for adopting

EVERYONE ADOPT DONT SHOP LOOK AT THIS PRECIOUS BABY AND HOW HAPPY THEY ARE TO BE LOVEDDD
For everyone here saying how bad they wish they could adopt a good dog like this one, you can make a shelter dog almost as happy by volunteering at your local shelter. The more volunteers they have, the more time each volunteer can spend giving these good boys & girls the attention/affection they crave.

Source: I volunteer at a cat shelter. Yes, shelter cats want affection too. I volunteer at the cat shelter because my dog is fabulous & my 2 cats at home are both complete assholes. This way I get the best of both worlds.
Shelters are like prisons for dogs.
When I fix my health issues and rediscover financial stability, I'm going to adopt so many goddamned dogs.
Pitbulls are very emotional. They need lots of love and attention!
I‚Äôm not crying you are 
Omg did I need to see this after hours of reading the thread about the worst thing you've read on Wikipedia. Thank you for posting, thank you for adopting. Just thank you tonight. 
You did the right thing. Good stuff OP. 
If this doesn't deserve gold I don't know what doed
Pitbulls are the bestest boyes and girls youll ever know! 
Breaking New: a group of onion cutting ninjas have escaped and are terrorizing unsuspecting reddit browsers.
Honestly shelters can be very depressing. But, if we do these things with the dog's happiness in mind, I suppose it *is* better to take them from an unhappy place to a happy place rather than taking away from a place where it's already happy.
This is adorable.

I rescued my sweet girl last July. She was just as happy and am happy to have been her second chance.


It looks so sad at the start. I wish every dog had a good home and family (though I know a lot of these shelters do their best).
There aren't that many adoption places where I am, and the official ones have really onerous requirements like having an interview and then having them assess your house.
"what is your dumbass looking at?"

*giggles* stop it dumbass stop it! 
*In the Aaaarrrmmss offff the AAAANNNGGGEEELLLSS*
Pits are such sweet babies.
Always adopt.
my dog donuts came from the shelter, i had him for 7 and a half years. was the absolute sweetest dog alive. he made it to 8.5 years old before cancer took him. i am absolutely  devastated. and although i am not ready right now, seeing this made me think for a moment that i will someday get another...they truly are the best dogs.  

[little snuggle beast](https://imgur.com/a/qKKdz/ ) - he would come and push his nose right into me all the time. it‚Äôs been a little over a month and for the most part i‚Äôve stopped  crying, although seeing this this morning hurt. 
Pit bulls = the best
We really don't deserve dogs
My ex fiance got me a black lab pitty for my birthday a few years back. While I'm not the most active person , he seemed to match my tempermant and energy perfectly. He'll have spouts of energy and want to play , then he'll just be perfectly fine just laying on my feet while I do computer work (read: gaming). He is 100% love and I die a little inside every day that I leave for work because he watches me out the window as I leave. 

Dogs are the best part of life, I swear. 

Edited for pictures of pup. Mines the bigger one. The other is his younger brother, my grandmother's dog. Hiro! https://imgur.com/gallery/iaGUT
So jealous--I wish someone would adopt *me* and take me home ("shelter"=~work cubicle). I've been sulking and whining for years and years--no luck!
When I got Fionna, she was sad, skinny, had been in the kennel for three months straight, and just wanted anyone‚Äôs attention. When she got home, after exploring for a couple hours, she discovered all the unused toys from my moms dog. She went wild, destroyed about half of them in a few hours. Then it was bedtime and she cuddled up right next to me. 

Gotta remember to post something like this later today

I wouldn‚Äôt mind if this whole sub started doing these before/after adoption posts
Man I don't want to seem like a dick or anything, but...you guys always seem to have the most depressing looking shelters nearby.

The one we've gone to has two sections (different small buildings) for dogs: small and big.  Sure, there is a back room for staff that I honestly don't know what goes on in there, but the dogs have a room inside and a decent play area outside.  The ones where they have a small room like that is better than nothing, but...well, social animals need other animals, man.
She was in a pit of despair. But then realized her new home was no bull. 
I never comment on anything but this made me cry. Years ago, I adopted a Great Dane from an outdoor "shelter" where the one paid employee would put dogs in a box, back his truck up so the exhaust fit into a hole in the box. You can imagine what happened next... And this would unfold in front of the other dogs, poor things. The guy told me this Great Dane was too mean and would bite me, lost cause. She was old, underweight and covered in scars, recently had puppies. Again, lost cause. As soon as he got the gate open she hid. I bent down on my knees, eyes down, spoke softly to her, eventually making my way to where she cowered. I got the leash on her and took her to the car. She JUMPED right in and we got the hell out of there. Her shyness totally changed when we left. She only lived around 3 years after but I never had such a faithful, loving dog and I've had plenty of good ones before and since. Please consider adopting, you might be really surprised what they overcome when they're given a second chance. I know in my heart she was as grateful as I was. 
Thank you for getting a bully! They are truly amazing dogs when loved like a family member. Enjoy the years of happiness to come!!!

Pibbles really are viscous, I see

Can confirm, have a snuggly goofball 
Cute pibble!
I have a pittie just like this and she has resting sad face. Basically does this transformation multiple times every day! 
It makes me so happy to see pit bulls being adopted even with that awful Super Bowl ad!! They‚Äôre just the sweetest babies ‚ù§Ô∏è
Pitties are the BEST! So sweet, loving and playful. They have an awful reputation...but I think people like us are helping to dispel some of the nonsense. I have 4! Seems like a lot, but they are my pride and joy. They coexist peacefully with my 3 cats. When they snuggle up next to me and I can hear their little hearts beating, and feel that warm doggie breath...I'm in my happy place. God bless pitties! 
G O O D B O Y E
I couldn't adopt this kind of dogs. I'd always fear that one day any abuse he might have suffer from its past life would haunt him and he's turn on him. Since staff / pits are often owned by assholes / retards / abusive pet owners, even more so the abandoned ones the odds would be too high for my comfort.  
These breeds are ruined for me because of the "image" they have. All I see looking at one is a ball of violence in disguise, I can't go past it. I'd be paranoid to have one under my roof who's probably been abused, beaten or neglected. Both for my safety and the safety of visitors / neighboors.  
So I'll pass on these scenarios, no idea how you all can repress this fear.
Put bills are the same as every other breed, just strong, like many other breeds. I don't care what anyone says. A dog starts with a pure heart. 
Imagine what goes some adopted kids‚Äô minds...
That‚Äôs a good looking pit. 
don‚Äôt adopt pitbulls they‚Äôre so aggressive hahaha /s
Most resilient dogs ever, wish I could adopt them all!
The amount of misinformation in here about pits had me thinking i was in r/politics. Reddit might be one of the least informed places on the internet.... 
[removed]
[removed]
I have a special place in my heart for pits because they are so abused by did fighters and used by the media to SENSATIONALIZE.  Yes pits have the strength to do great harm, but they are not born viscious.  Just like any animal if you abuse it, it is more likely to be aggressive.  Generally pits are lovable and affectionate. THANK YOU OP for saving this baby.
I know I am walking into the downvote storm, but fuck these dogs. and fuck this obsession with pits. If you need a companion - get just a dog. don't be on a lookout for a pit. 

fuck these dogs.
Pit bulls are the most loving doggies. All they want is snuggles and lovey doveys ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
One of these ate a kid not long ago near where I live. Family had brought in a friend‚Äôs dog. 

http://kfor.com/2018/01/15/dog-that-killed-3-year-old-oklahoma-girl-had-only-been-in-home-for-two-weeks/

I know it‚Äôs a complicated issue. But it‚Äôs just me and my young one. I‚Äôd never risk his safety even a little by bringing a pit I didn‚Äôt fully raise and train from a pup into our home. Might not even then. Would just rather not bring in a living thing capable of eating our faces but not capable of reasoning and communicating. Might not even if it could! I‚Äôd be too busy pulling an E.T. Go home or selling it and getting rich.

I feel like I'm living the life in the first part of the gif. 
You dun good!
Adopted dogs are always the best
This makes me very happy. Good job OP :)
nice video liked it
I just imagine this elongated and exaggerated, ‚ÄúYeeeeeeeeAAAAAAAAHHHH!‚Äù as he‚Äôs getting belly rubbed. 
My otherwise frozen heart was temporarily thawed watching this dog. 
Thank you !!!!
Ohhhh HAMMMM üíñ
Aweeee. I'm so glad you could give that pupper such a good home.
Love that
Thats the same face my Pit makes when I don't pet him. Fucker knows what he's doing.
Nothing make me feel happier than someone adopting a dog from a shelter.
This made my chest feel weird. 
This is making me cry deadass I'm so happy for that dog. I hope you treat him well and like the awsome  perfect boye he is .
You're doing God's work.
These are the best kinds of videos ever. 
Timber 
Happy lil pupper. üê∂
D'Awwwwwwwwww
This would make an amazing commercial for pet adoption!
This made me cry! We live in an apartment now that doesn't allow pits. As soon as we are in a house, we're getting one!!!
To be fair... I would be sadder in a kennel than in the grass having my belly rubbed.  Regardless of adoption status. 
Bless you
Can't wait to see this one make the rounds on Facebook

Still watching after about 10-15 times tbh
If only we could recreate this video with a child...
it is always nice to see an animal get to be so happy when it is given a home. I hope the little beastie lives a long and happy life with its owner.
10/10
This is the single most powerful post I read today that restores my faith in humanity!
To be fair my dog sometimes looks like the first one even in their loving homes
Every boy is a GOOD BOY
Angel...you are an angel...
I just want to adopt all the puppies and kitties :(
Glad it's not the other way around.
Who's chopping onions....!?
That looks like a really shitty shelter. 
This <3
Did u get to keep the blanket?
So glad this good boy found a family! Congrats and THANK YOU üòä 
Watery eyes anyone? No?........ just me?.....
I love dogs.
üòû -> üòä
heartwarming

Such a happy doggo
What a beautiful dog. I hope it gets as much love as possible :)
P
My dog hated me when we first saw each other at the Humane Society. Now she is my best housemate.
This made me teary eyed. Thanks for giving this sweet pup a forever home. 
This is bullshit. :( you made me sad.

But I‚Äôm gonna get a dog and make sure he‚Äôs never as sad as me
Adorable doggo! Thank you for providing a great home :)
Which shelter is this? I'd like to send them some pee pads.
I'll admit it

I cried
Eyebrows and tongue make me love you.
Reminds me of my little rottie. She was bald from sickness and her teeth were kicked in when my boyfriend got her, but she turned into the happiest dog in the world. I miss her so much
My dog looks at me like that when I wake him up too- and he‚Äôs a spoiled fatass 
cute
Just adopted a kitten last weekend. 


She likes playing this game where she hides from me inside the lining of my couch, acts like she's going to stroke out in terror when I look at her.....and then purs like a motor boat and then falls asleep when I finally manage to rummage her out of the couch and hold her for five seconds.   It's great -_- 


Love her to death but.....dogs communicate their affection and appreciation a little more clearly and immediately it seems.
That‚Äôs like me at work vs. 30 minutes after being at the bar. 
Pretty girl =D 
We don't deserve them
Before: nobody wants me...

After: awwwww yiss hooman gib me aaaaall da scrtches
This is why I can‚Äôt go to shelters
Look like s/he lost all hope when in the shelter. But NOPE, it was best day ever!
This is the absolute best thing ever 
r/BeforeNAfterAdoption
"I have just met you, and I love you."
Happy alligator-face makes me happy.
Oh my Muttley was just like this! She kept her back turned to everyone that walked by and the third I walked by she looked at me with the most pathetic eyes and gave the tiniest of tail wags. We celebrated ten years together in October, just a few weeks before I had to say goodbye because of advancing lung cancer. She was wonderful and I miss her almost every day. 
What a difference some love can have on a doggo!
That‚Äôs a happy house hippo.
<3 my heart
This makes my heart just melt. 
A thousand upvotes. 
This brightened up my day. Thanks. üôè
Beautiful :-)
r/BeforeNAfterAdoption
Hell vs. heaven.. Good on you


Ill be doing the same sometime this year
Best thing ever!! !!!
what a sweet lady!
I just awww'd x 5
This post made my day!!
Awwwww!
It‚Äôs things like this that make me think I won‚Äôt be able to stop adopting dogs and I will eventually need to buy a farm for them all the play and live on. This is so sweet. 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
I want to adopt a shelter dog. I have the time to give a dog the attention it needs but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm not financially stable enough. Any advice?
Looks like my old pup! 
Thank you for doing this for that lovely dog. 
Imagine how he will feel after his first week!!
beautiful
The existance of good people continues so i m suprised and happy :)
We don't deserve them.
Awwwwww pitties make my heart smile 
This reminds me I took my doggo in for adoption at my local dog shelter. I really want to go back to see what ended up happening to him or if hes still around. I dont know anything about that process and if its even possible to go visit him or even from afar. He was a cute little doberman so I hope he got adopted by someone who actually has the time and energy for such a qt little doggo . His name was Bandit. ;-(
ADOPT don't shop!!!
PLOT TWIST : The images are in reverse chronological order. Owner played with dog for last time, before dumping him at the shelter.
I‚Äôve had my dog for 2 years and she‚Äôs still annoyed by my presence...
We adopted a dog too.  He has been the most fantastic addition to our family.  
Love it!!!
Damn. Thank you for this. 
Whelp, my heart is broken.
Eff op and eff all of you. I miss my lil boy so much it hurts right now (jack rat that is now living with my parents and their chihuahuas and neighbor aunt's bull terriers) he's doing great but he's still missed. Not a sad story but mah feels tho
So cute
go bless op
Ahhhhh. General Reposti
That is class. 
You‚Äôre the man
After watching this video I want to go home and hug my dog. 
That is so awesome, I love seeing stuff like this
üò≠üò≠üò≠
Thank you for the cuteness 
PITBULLLLSSSS :') 
This made me very sad, because of the first video of him. It just reminds me of how many other animals aren't adopted like this guy. 

Good job

I wish in was able to adopt them all though to be honest. 


Dog mellow and relaxed. Then dog tickled and excited. Life has so many facets.
The doggo is so happy! Wants me to change the phrase like "If you happy and you know, roll on the floor!"
His face in the kennel made me genuinely sad üòî
The clip where he was in the shelter was so heartbreaking.  :/  Poor doggie.  I'm so glad he has a home with lots of belly rubs and dog smiles now.  
Aww happy doggo! My cat was the same way. First night I brought him home he slept curled against my stomach, purring. Three years later, he still takes up that position every night
this is the motivation that i needed. 
..dogs can feel love!
Just like in the movie A dog's purpose
This makes me so happy!
such a cutie ;-)
Presenting the belly is a way of showing submission. 
I love seeing people adopt shelter dogs. Many great dogs there waiting for a moment like this. 
I love this so much
I would love to have a dog. Would be great to have a friend like that. Looks wonderful.
From sad to Red Rocket happy......nice 
He won the lottery .... give him a happy life üëä
Thank you. 
born again.
Ow üòç
Now,  not to undermine what happened here. I adopted a street dog myself as I can't stand what some of these dogs goes through.

But,my dog looks like that too when he has just woken up... And the second part when we have run around playing for a bit.
This is why people should always rescue
You rock op!
Aweeeeeee :D

That was pretty much the case with my doggie Mona when i got her from the pound.

Staffies rule, she has such a  beautiful colour (and all its ears :D )
Mine did this haha. Just looked like there's no hope and then as soon as he got out he thrashed around the room excitedly, pissed all over my car seats and then passed out because he was exhausted lmao
Not all heroes wear capes. 
It breaks my heart when I see animals at shelters. Specially knowing what happens to them when they aren't adopted...
It's great that he was adopted and does look happy but... sometimes dogs just wanna chill, you know?
Adorable 
An adopted dogs life is a good life. 
So cute i'm melting
This really made my day,  thanks for sharing 
Tears! Feels!
Id hate to go to a shelter and pick one out, leave the rest behind. I would have to take all of them with me. 
Sleepy dog comfy in bed vs awake dog being loved. Don‚Äôt throw shade at your local shelter 
Dogs are fantastic. I can‚Äôt imagine a world without our best buddies.
And this is why I will never work for the humane society or volunteer for such things as pet shelters.

I would become a domestic zookeeper.
wwwoooooooooooowyo
I‚Äôm really not a dog person. But I feel like Reddit is turning me into a dog person. 
Congrats on the adoption! Kindness is courtesy of the superior mind.
Have fun with ur new pupp.  Good to see people adopting. Hats off. üòâ
Can only say, - Aaw
Fantastic! 
Wow, this made my day. Thanks OP.
rub my belly!
:‚Äô)
We chose our shelter Yoji because she was calm and walked up to the gate.  She had been there almost 6 months and her time was almost up.   Little did we know what a crazy, sweet, major gross-o she was gonna turn out to be!   9 years later she lets our toddlers crawl all over her, still begs for treaties, and loves eating a nice pair of lady skivvies.  I don't want her to ever leave....
Always respect someone like you taking dog from animal shelters and happy that doggy is in good hands and lively. 
People a pet is a commitment. Mine are family if you won't spend money on them don't get them. Yea they cute when puppies then you don't train them and then you trash them. Disgusting! Glad that dog was saved because he is a mean pit mix. No he is a big teddy bear that just wants to be loved and give love. 
my oldest dog was adopted. He pissed himself with excitement all over my brand new car that I got for my 20th.
The second part must happen to every sad dog 
 üíûIt really makes my heart happy to see such a good fuzzle get a second chance at life üíû I've had a few rescues over the years and they truly can amaze you with the amount of love they have and just want to give it all to you. 
Rescues are the best!
Well done, wins all around. This makes me happy, thanks for sharing.
You picked yourself a cuddle muffin. Nice work.
I love staffys there such lovable dogs they just love to laze around chilling out, my border colly , complete opposite, hated lazing around and got depressed if doing nothing, just wanted to play ball all day which can be a pain. I think boarder colly should stay as working dogs. Staffys are perfect home pets. love nothing more than a good snuggle and lazing around. 
When you're home alone then mom gets home from work
üò≠üò≠
Happiness is a sweet simple thing 
*urge to rush home for pets and boops intensifies*
I hate most people but love every dog I‚Äôve met! 
That‚Äôs a doggo :) 
My dude just showed up at work one day. Went down for lunch, came back with puppy. No regrets.
I just want to say thank you 
If it wasn't impossible to find a rental with a pit I'd have 4. 
Made me wanna adopt my next one. Great vid!! That should be on those SPCA commercials, instead of animals just shaking in the cold. Show how heartwarming it is when you adopt oneüëçüèª
Not gonna lie, I teared up.
Cute little pibbles 
Just like getting out of jail! 
Hey look it's me at work....

Then me not at work.

I adopted my retired racing greyhound from a lovely group who finds homes for these retirees.

i walked in with a laundry list of requirements, the lady who was the most sociable of the group pointed to one. A quiet black one with a little grey around the muzzle, sitting quietly in his cage. To twist the knife, she said "He's so quiet he was bullied a little on the ride home!" 

MINE! 

Took him out for a walk, he pulled a bit and was pretty excited. I wasn't sure, being a first-time owner.

Eight months on, he's more welcome at my friends' places than I am :) 
I love it when dogs roach. Our greyhound does it all the time and then tries to eat her own tail. :D
Gifs like this always bring me so much joy... and remind me of my one adopted pupper I have. He was a hassle at first because no one ever taught him any manners or right from wrong but he was always a super fast learner and listener. I remember seeing him playing with a toy by himself in his pin area and he brought it up to the window and just looked at me like ‚ÄúAre you going to play with me?‚Äù Instantly knew he was the one. I love him to death with his big ol‚Äôears.
 The scene in the second half is priceless. What a happy guy or gal.
Both of my [really wonderful dogs](https://i.imgur.com/h3w8c7s.jpg) are rescues, and it is a very satisfying feeling seeing them both healthy and happy.  


Sure, there are plenty of ways to get dogs, but when you take them out of an adoption center, or get one that was wandering the streets, it is such a win-win!


Hats off to OP!
Good on you, he looks so happy. Seeing dogs in adoption kennels breaks my heart. 
This made my day. Thank you for sharing this!
Sweet!
Jesus fuck this makes me feel bad for dogs at shelters....  How do you not walk in and leave with all of them??????  God and I will have words when I see him.  He better be training hard or that asshole is getting arm barred.
This is actual footage of me at work versus being at home.
Happiness overload. 
Love this! 
Was it John Wick?
how can dogs look so sad??? like you can see the eyebrows (do dogs even have them) scrunched up like a baby about to cry. how do they do that.
A dog must feel the love of his master 
Oh this fills my heart. Being able as a human to to give these boys and gals a good life! Urgh poor things all day on a cage with not much to do. 
i fucking LOVE PITBULLS THEYRE SO GODDAMN CUTE
It‚Äôs like not having a girlfriend for years and then getting one
My goldfish picked me out. He would swim up to the glass, stare at me with the most sincere eyes, and swim away. But he repeated this every 30 seconds for the entirety of my trip. Our relationship has been ethereal ever since. 
Sweet baby!!
I love pibbels.
His poor face in the first half fucking destroyed me. Not knowing if this is just the way life is or if it'll get better. I wish every domesticated animal could know the joy and relief of finding a home, or better yet, not have to experience being confined in a shelter in the first place. Bless you for giving this animal one. 
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying 
This thread is breaking my heart.
Have my upvote !
My girl is coming up on 3 years old (she's a small dog and we don't have much of a clue what she is  since she doesn't match what a jack Russel mix looks like), we got her two weeks after my old dog died because my mom saw her ad on a foster/adoption site and she was looking for another Jack Russel. Lo and behold, her picture was a medical setting and she looked sad as fuck and was listed as a Jack Russel mix, plus she was at a high kill shelter. Come Christmas Eve NOBODY knew except my mom and older brother that the "family friend and her kid" coming over would be a lady and future sock-stealer. She (the dog) was so scared she pissed herself a few seconds after being brought into the house. At 6 months old on December 24th, 2015, she was timid and shy and adorable. We all took our time around her because we knew she was already so scared and nervous, a few hours later she couldn't decide whose lap she wanted to sit in. Every time someone would sit down, she'd rocket across the room to go and love on them. It was amazing the complete transformation she took after she realized we were different from the shelter people, that we would love her separately as our own. She was called Lulu at the shelter so we kept the name anyways.

2.5 years later, she has the biggest personality I have ever seen in a dog. Even my old dog (god rest her soul, she was a badass) didn't have as obvious a one as Lulu does now. Although she is a very antisocial dog (she doesn't get along well with any other dog, no matter the temperament) and doesn't like new people easily (HATES men with beards no matter how nice they are), she's a clever and sneaky little shit. Almost akin to a toddler. On the plus side, she doesn't shit or piss everywhere, she learned very quickly that if she had to go and we didn't take her outside in time that she just had to do her business in a certain area. unfortunately it's a carpeted area and she avoids any peepads we put down. 

Sorry for the rambling, she's like a little daughter to me and I love her to bits. 
Vs 30 mins after being left alone in your living room...
A true hero
im not crying.....you're crying!!
I needed this.
So so cute, what a great before and after, awesome!
