It took a long time to meet him.

11/10 worth it.
‚ÄúOh, you were watching the whole time...‚Äù
No matter for what, Mochi is always the best name
All I see is a moving blanke.....OHH there he is!
My mind instantly went to r/hatfilms even though I know this mochi is much younger
I let out a very audible gasp at the cuteness when he emerged
Thought I was on /r/hatfilms for a second there.
SO CUUUUUUTE
That was worth the wait!
That is the CUTEST FREAKIN THING I'VE EVER SEEN! :')
Your blanket is haunted
and... boo! I mean bark! :)
I NEED MORE FOOTAGE. THE SUSPENSE KILLED ME.
‚ÄúOh hi! Didn‚Äôt realise you were standing there.‚Äù
OUR DOG‚ÄôS NAME IS MOCHI TOO!!!  He just turned 1 in September [Cutest face ever](https://imgur.com/a/FGow9JC)
What a rollercoaster, the suspense is killing me.   
SHOW. ME. THE PUPPY!! There he is! Good boy Mochi, good boy!
I audibly gasped when his face popped out oh my gosh
Why is there so many white dogs named Mochi?
I don‚Äôt know why but he looks like a scout to me
My Jack Russell, Archie‚Äôs just the same with a blanket - been shnoogling under them for over 6 years!
The Great Escape
I feel like using the laundry basket to contain the pup is genius.
It looks just like Bolt so cute <3
Mochi does a peek-a-BOO(?
So cuteee
[deleted]
My dog is almost 5 years old, and still loves to burrow under the covers and spend a significant amount of time figuring out how to get out. It‚Äôs adorable every time.
I was bracing myself for the cuteness. But I was still shocked! Too cute!
I was watching the video clock and progressively getting upset as pupper did not reveal but OP did, in fact, deliver.
Wooo cute worth to wait

This is maybe the most important thing on the internet today. Or perhaps ever?
Get him a rubber dog with a strawhat he can play with
"Kept you waiting huh?"
Thank you for giving your doggo a great name! Bad pet names are an epidemic and you are commended. Cannoli, Mraz, and Orko say hi to Mochi! üê∂ üê± üê±
Perfect name for that peekaboo good boy!
So cute! What breed?
Beautiful pup. Can't wait to get me a dog.

Hello sweetheart!!!! So nice to meet you üòç
Mocha  is adorable !
I literally just screamed in delight
Mochi is absolutely adorable! Such a cutie. I love the name too. 

FYI: I bought that same exact pen for my papillon. She was a 2.5lbs. puppy and managed to somehow chew a whole through the zipper door on the side and escape. We found her free roaming the house when we got home. We had to throw it away because the hole was too big and she would taunt us by peeking her head through it while playing inside. -_- so be careful if you think little Mochi might be an escape artist!
What is the name of that wonderful pen you have your puppy in?  I need to know for future puppies.
Hi, Mochi! You're too stinking cute üòç
