I love his reaction when the guy shows him where it is at the start.
I would not want to be that toy.
If this is Messi, he's not a giant mountain lion, one of his issues is that he's significantly smaller than a male mountain lion should be.
Mountain lions: One of the most agile predators on the planet. 

Also Mountain lions:
object permanence do be like that
I grew up in Montana and we found a Mountain Lion cub on the side of the road on my way to school. Middle of a big snow-storm. He was abandoned so my dad took him home and called FWP (fish, wildlife & park). We wanted to keep him but they said ‚Äúyeah, absolutely not‚Äù and came and picked him up, but we had him for the day. 

Even as a practically new-born kitten he was ENORMOUS. We had to grab him with Welders gloves and an entire snowsuit and he could still claw/bite through it. Their power is insane.

He loved our kitty cube at home. Our cat actually seemed to get along with him but once he actually got a good look and registered what he was he ran out of the room and then it took him like 6 months to gain courage to step foot inside the living room again. 

We also had a deer and a few other odd assorted animals. Feels like a different life considering I‚Äôm a hardcore city boy now.
A cat is a cat is a cat.
imagine burglarizing this house
it's a very small puma. i don't remember exactly but it has bone or growth problems.
Honestly kinda funny how easily he was fooled though... üòÇ
Now let's see him take it away.
The cat would have flipped if he didn't find it in those 3.
He put all of his points into STR
This is Messi the puma. He lives in russia with his owners and was rescued from a petting zoo. He was too old to be released so he's now a pet. But his parents still take great care of him and they have a youtube channel. It's I Am Puma. It's all russian tho
he a little confused, but he got the spirit
Just a reminder for folks in the US: the mountain lion is the ~~third~~ fourth largest cat in the world and it lives *juuust* over there.

Edit: Jaguars have about 20 pounds on mountain lions on the extreme of the scale.
Messi!
All cute and everything and then he gets it and you see the ripped front legs on that beast
I don't think I would like to be at the same place with a frustrated Mountain Lion.
So my 2 dogs rip apart any plush toy we buy them in seconds, but this big cat doesn't rip his. Where can I buy this indestructible toy?
Steve French is just a big kitty
What a cute derpy boi
Nature is lit, fierce ass giant kitty
This is Messi. He is not a giant mountain lion. He‚Äôs a very small mountain lion.
Is that Steve French?
Seems pretty small for a mountain lion
I_am_puma on instagram
Who tf has a pet mountain lion and one that knows how to find a toy!?
When I find that last bag of Cheetas in the cupboard
I wonder where the video is from? Hopefully a big cat rescue
Dare you to scratch that belly when he flops over onto his back
Is it legal to have mountain lions as pets?
Y'know, this is big cat is cool and all but if have a friend over and Mister (or Miss) doesn't like them, you might have a bad case on your hands...
Object permanence has left the chat
Cute, but most animals (including cats) don‚Äôt have the intellect to conceptualize most forms of object permanence, meaning that when they can‚Äôt observe/sense an object, to them it no longer exists. All the videos you see of an animal actually playing the shell game and ‚Äúguessing‚Äù which one its under is actually a trained routine with predetermined or signaled selections, because the animal has no clue that the food/toy/whatever is under any of the shells, much less has followed it moving around.
He fucking sucks at the shell game
Everyone be like aw thats so cute

Untill u realise thst is a natural predator
Damn this motherfucker dumb as shit
Risky. If he decides he's tired of your shell game he'll use your head like he does the toy at the end of the video.
first, not too quick ehhh? 

then, oh, sure, quick - have toy please
Feel deceived, might eat you later
Let the wookie win.
I can only imagine what his zoomies look like in the house!
of all the animals I would not taunt, the puma may be up there
Mountain lion: What is this sorcery
If I‚Äôm ever being chased by a mountain lion, I‚Äôm going to hide under 1 of 3 containers and swap just 2 of them.
I'm fairly confident I wouldn't have the balls to do what that dude was doing. I'm not sure how comfortable I'd feel, essentially, annoying a giant mountain lion
You know, I would just let that very big cat have his favourite toy at all times. 

‚ÄúWHERE‚ÄôS MY TOY, MOTHERFUCKA? I DON‚ÄôT HAVE TIME FOR STUPID BUCKETS!‚Äù Chaos and bloodletting ensues.
I at first got frustrated at how damn dumb it is.  Then when I saw how playful and happy it was at getting the toy I didn't care.
I‚Äôve watched a documentary on this mountain lion and he‚Äôs actually quite small for his species. Why is everything in reddit embellished or fake?
What is this sorcery!
Awwwww
At first I was like ‚Äúoops wrong bucket silly kitty‚Äù, but then I was like ‚Äúholy shit that‚Äôs a fucking mountain lion‚Äù
I fully expected him to attack the guy when it wasn't in the bucket.
How beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
Mountain lions are just r/oversizedkittens lol
Really bizarre seeing this absolute unit of a feline do the same thing my tiny kittens do.
Huh.  I'd have thought a skill like this would be top of the list for an animal that lives or dies based on how good it is at keeping track of where something it wants is going.
Wholesome content. üëè
That thing could change that guys day in short order.
All I can think of when seeing this is GTA V hearing one growl then seeing Wasted
If he wasnt your friend he would have recked you. I tried to pet a wild kitty one time and it stabbed my finger with its claws
He‚Äôs not very good at is he
A gif that would be extra better with sound.
Wow that is terrifying and cute at the same time!
What a dumbass he saw it fucking move
Fuck that, my cat is smarter!
"Win"
But he lost
TIL mountain lions really suck at Shell game
Quite the pet...... I imagine anything can be friendly bit its that one moment it goes back to its instincts
When you put all points into stealth and your intelligence be like
Technically it's a runt mountain lion, not a giant one. Which is why he is even a tammed animal. "Messi" has a lot of health problems and his small size would make him unsuitable to live in the wild
That looks pretty small as mountain lions go, but it also looks like something you‚Äôd have to be really really stupid to have in your bedroom playing the shell game.

People are morons. That‚Äôs not a pet, it‚Äôs a dangerous predator.
How are lions so cute,you know whatever a cat is a cat
He may be a predator, but in the end hes still a cat
What are we doing with a mountain lion indoors again
Who the hell has a pet mountain lion?
Other than a really dumb person, I mean.
he dumb
Mountain lion my arse!
He left his six sense in the forest.
Hahaha He was soooo stoked about his toy!!
He‚Äôs gorgeous
So fun and cute!! Lovely
Seems like playing a game that frustrates a giant mountain lion might be straying a tad off the path of wisdom.
How many dooking muscles are in those arms god damn
That's one cat you don't want to piss off.
Aw... whoah
I love Messi!
I love the reaction when the toy is first revealed haha
actually he is the 2/3rd size of a normal mountain lion, he is not giant
Imagine going hunting and having that catdude as your hunting partner
Cute as hell, still terrifying.
Didn't know big floppa plays games too
I need to do this with my cats now.
‚ÄúLet the Wookie win.‚Äù
like a big cat
Is this Messi?
If that's his favorite toy, I'd hate to see what he does to his least favorite.
Good thing he's pretty
It looks like his instinct is the 2nd bucket to me.

Then he heads to where he saw it last.

Hey bro, THERE IS A MOUNTAIN LION *RIGHT THERE.*
That‚Äôs no giant. He‚Äôs actually a dwarf. They get way bigger
Dude literally gave him 1 chance... the fuck kinda easy mode....
Does no one think this is dangerous?
Kitty wants his stuffed toy RIGHT NOW DAMMIT
Okay. How big do your balls have to be to think, huh, let‚Äôs play hide and seek with a mountain lion! Wait! Let‚Äôs do it in our ROOM!
It's called thimblerig you simpleton
I loves it! I kills it!
aww? More like awwshit amirite?
I'd be scared to let him lose the game.
He's brave.
This is only a regular size mountain lionüòê

Awe cute... cute... cute... OH FUCK, RUN!
Not to be dramatic, but I'd die for giant mountain lion
Pretty darn cute.
when it realises you sassing it. RIP friend aka food.
a little dumb!
That ending is terrifying.  Acts just like a housecat but with lethal clawing for the belly scritch trick.
This sub usually doesn't leave a lump of fear in my throat. That poor toy.

Edit: autostupid
It's a cougar named Messi. Here's their YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/Iampuma
I wouldn't upset the mountain lion; "let the wookie win"
How do you trim a mountain lions claws so it doesn‚Äôt absolutely destroy things like that bed? Like do you tranquilizer it first? üòÇ
This is actually a very small mountain lion.
You‚Äôre playing a dangerous game my friend
He dumb
Big cats really are just... big cats
Disappointed at how low iQ this animal is
Ha. I‚Äôm so much smarter than this cat.
I have pet and briefly snuggled a baby one.  They feel like velvet.
Where can I adopt one of these for my van security system and cuddle buddy?
Cats are the coolest
Big or small *cats will still be cats*. I for one would love to hear the audio.
The fact that a mountain lion has kept that toy intact yet my dog manages to destroy everything she touches
what a dumbass it was so obvious
That cat is so fucking adorable it hurts
This mountain lion treats his favorite stuffed toy more gently than my dog does.
Mountain lions should be in the wild; if that‚Äôs not possible for ethical reasons as determined by veterinarians and zoologists and bioethicists, etc, the animal should be kept in an environment that resembles their natural environment as much as possible. Imho
I'd be to terafied of it getting g sick of my shit. DECEIVER OF TRUTH  YOU DIE RIGHT MEOW!
Idiot
Those shoulder muscles..... Seriously.
Oh...this is so cu.... OH MY FUCKING WORLD
I never knew a mountain lion could be so cute.
It's a puma, and it's ig is I_am_messi
Why does this guy have a mountain lion
Looks like an average-sized mountain lion.
TIL mountain lions suck at shell game.
My favorite thing about big cats is that they look and act exactly like house cats.
Cats are so fukin dumb lol
It‚Äôs my cake day
It‚Äôs all fun and games till it plays find the foot... with your foot.
Let the Wookiee win.
Those cats are so beautiful and fucking strong.  When I was in high school a wildlife handler brought a cub into our Environmental class.  That fucker grabbed my leg and playfully sank his teeth into my calf, I couldn't believe the strength this 2-month old cub had.
At least the guy didn't flip over the third bucket to reveal $1million..
Floppa
What a dumb creature
Had to double check to make sure this wasn't r/whatcouldgowrong
Floppa?
Wow he even moved it slowly. That's a dumb mountain lion
nope

Awww he's just a big stupid house cat
‚Äúgiant‚Äù??  bro that‚Äôs a normal mountain lion, even a bit small
He didn‚Äôt win...but who‚Äôs going to tell him he‚Äôs wrong? He‚Äôs damn terrifying
Why does this guy have a mountain lion in his living room.
Damn I didn't realize just how inferior they are to house cats in terms of mental acuity.
Cat is gonna be cat, size doesn‚Äôt matter.
thank you for sharing this. I didn't know how much I needed this.
This puma is stupid, but I would not dare to tell him upfront.
Give steve french his toy back
We all get it wrong sometimes
Wonder how many hours that favourite stuffed toy lasts...
Give it the toy even when it's wrong. You don't want to upset the very big kitty ; p
For a moment he thought he had lost it forever.
u/vredditshare
Not very smart but can lift heavy things
So, who's gonna tell the jungle cat he didn't actually win? Not it!
Lol. Looks like my sweet pibble, vs my cat. RIP jinx
He's thick as shit, what's everyone going in about ?
ohhhhhh your amazing
Mountain lions get up to four guesses.
I think he‚Äôs opposite of ‚Äúgiant‚Äù. I remember reading a comment from his owner on social media. He said the cat can‚Äôt be release due to his shorter then normal legs, it would never survive in the wild.
Here‚Äôs nothing see about this. Stupid cat!
The cutest thing about this video to me is the fact that a mountain lion has a favorite stuffed toy.
I have a love/hate relationship with videos if super deadly animals being adorable.

My brain goes "OMG I NEED TO GO PET A MOUNTAIN LION" and then I'm like *No, you'll die*
just imagine that's your face.   only a few feet away from that.
Yikes!
I wouldn't like to try and cut that things nails!  üòØü§£!
It gets so freaking excited
That went from cute to horrifying after he got that poor toy
Jeeze. He's  effing huge. Pleeease do not piss him off ü•∞ i have a feeling he wouldn't be a good loser. ‚ù§
Was it a cat I saw?
What an idiot
He chose . . . poorly.
Why is that animal in a bedroom?
Just give him the toy!!!!
Cheater!! Probably is using his super sniffer to smell his toy :)
I want a puma so bad
How is this fellow allowed to have a wild cat as a pet? I know it's being taken care of, but the cat needs more stimulation than sitting at home playing with plus toys.
"oh its not here what about the othe- AMNOMNOMNOMNOM!!!"
Wait my question is why does this guy have a mountain lion living in his house ?
He is more intelligent than me
Stupid cat
Pshawww! I totally knew where it was. This cat‚Äôs an idiot.
Let the Wookiee win
Oh god its learning
Cats are so dumb
This was basically my LSAT yesterday
The most dangerous game.
I like his mustache
The real magic trick is taking that stuffy away from him without being ripped to shreds.
That‚Äôs not a lion, it‚Äôs a Cougar.
Op is a serial reposter cmv
They keep track based on hearing. Should have moved it around way more then just once and one spot. Not fair to the cat.
Do big cats react to catnip in the same way house cats do?
Imagine if that was a babies head
I‚Äôd be terrified to take his stuffie away from him
Wow he really sucked at that game
That is not a giant mountain lion.

It's just a mountain lion of normal size!
It‚Äôs Steve french !!!
That big kitty is just a little kitty at heart.
Alternate future news title related to this man and this giant mountain lion: ‚ÄúThus giant mountain lion who once played the shell game to win his favorite stuffed toy proceeded to engage in playing this game, and then, ate the man‚Äù
Love this so so much!!!
I sincerely hope that this is a rescued mountain lion in some kind of sanctuary and not just some POS who thinks it‚Äôs cool to have a mountain lion.
I love Messi, he's got a lot of health issues sadly. But he's got some great owners that help him in every way possible. Quite the personality.
Bro this lion is dumb as fuck
they really are just big cats
That's Messi from YouTube
What are the chances
If a cat is over 20lbs I‚Äôm not taking my chances.
Omg that‚Äôs adorable
He is so cute
Oh so we playing games with big cats now?!
 Babies have no concept of object permanence
Cheater is using his nose.
Wait a minute... thats Steve French!
Green Bean Chicken Wing
That‚Äôs a tiny mountain lion.. or maybe they‚Äôre bigger in Texas
You can see the absolute betrayal in his expression when he picks the wrong one and the joy when he gets it back! So wonderful!
But he lost tho
What a dummy
Beautiful cat ‚ù§Ô∏è
Not the sharpest tool in the shed, but definitely the cutest
Always like to see this video posted here and the others from their account.
Awww messi. Those muscles still scare the shit out of me.
He's doing remedial mountain lion school now.
Big cat
So cute!!!! Here, Kitty kitty... Oh, you wanna a piece of my face? Sure baby. Scratch away...
Cats are all the same.
He's just a big kittie boys. I know kitties.
Bro, that's a mountain lion in your bedroom. A mountain lion.
This is where the old saying ‚Äúdumb as a mountain lion‚Äù comes from.

I would hate tricking him and him getting upset. Lol
I love no matter their size, cats are cats.
Cheater >:(
STEVE FRENCH!
I want an extra large kitty cat!
What an idiot! Lol
He‚Äôs not very good at it, but that‚Äôs okay
J'zargo is confused, but delighted.
good thing that cat is not a sore loser.
A cat that large playing with a toy is terrifying.
Clever boy
He didn't win it though....
I suggest a new strategy. Let the kitty win.
I have a feeling you couldn't get that back even if you wanted.
Feels so scary and wonderful at the same time to see such a beautiful but powerful predator
its so cute!
That's Messi!   And he's not giant, he's small, which is why his kind owners are taking care of him as a "house cat."  Really recommend checking out his videos, they're awesome!
Even the smartest animals are like so much stupider than us
Damn that‚Äôs crazy
I've run into mountain lions before, when I was a kid.  Pretty chill monsters, at least the one's I ran into were.  In several alternate timelines, I was probably eaten by mountain lions as a child.
Is there a subreddit out there of big cats acting like house cats? The way he kicks at the end reminds me of what some cats do when they get a toy
Get a house cat.
Highly doubt that from this training vid
Aww Messi
Highly doubtful from this training vid
When you're really dumb but big and beautiful so it doesn't matter
Poor mans gold üèÖ
So many different feelings about this.  But mostly happy.
Keeping these animals as pets irks me. I hope regulation regarding their care are streamlined and thorough
Why does your cat looks suspiciously large? I'm scared
I wonder if the cat would get it right if the buckets were different colors
He‚Äôs actually a dwarf mountain lion üòÇ

I wouldn't tell him he was wrong
I want more pet lion videos on here
I need karma, badly...please help so I can get in contact with coinbase as they dont respond anywhere else besides on reddit !
It‚Äôs my cake day!
Is that an apartment? üò≥
Thought process: it was JUST under this one(picks first, empty). WTF JERRY, you prick. (Thinking logically now) Ok ok, I saw you move these two. It MUST be under this one..(anger intensifies) YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT TOY YOU ARE WORSE THAN A TURNIP OF A HUMAN BEAN!!
Oh, sure... Fuck with the animal that will chew your neck while you sleep.
‚ÄúI DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT MAGIC! YEAHHHH IM GONNA FUCK THIS THING UP‚Äù
i feel like adopting a baby lion after watching this <3
You trick that thing, it'll eat your balls
It plays like a cat üòÇ
He moves the bucket one position to his left and the cougars already forgot which bucket it‚Äôs in that‚Äôs just hilarious.
Thats cool
Aww, Messi!
who is here to see how giant mountain lion looks
Reddit got lions tigers and bears on here looking like kitten cakes. I want to get him like he got that toy.
So who's going to tell him he lost?
Honestly this is really sad. This is a wild animal, it‚Äôs not only wrong, but dangerous to keep it as a pet. It may have been trained, but it‚Äôs still a wild animal with natural instincts- it could lash out at any moment.
I would never take the risk of being around a big predator like that, with the exception of Messi. He is the sweetest boy in the world, love his channel.
I think that‚Äôs a Puma.
A CUTE AND PRECIOUS BABY
Enough of your Witch Craft my stuffy dammit !
Was anyone else scared that he would attack the dude when it wasn't in the first place anymore?
Just wait for him to get annoyed with his toy disappearing and realizing it‚Äôs the human making it disappear. The human will get the same treatment his toy does in the end.
This is what I don‚Äôt understand. Would you ever play with a mountain lion or big cat with your hands? No? Then don‚Äôt do it with your house cat!! It teaches your cat to attack your hands and hunt you. Train and play with your cats correctly people
I don‚Äôt wanna be a downer but shouldn‚Äôt we stop supporting things like this? We all watched tiger kings... this can‚Äôt be ideal for a mountain lion obviously so why is this a thing..
Man people have the weirdest pets. I think having a mountain lion would just scare the fuck out of me. I‚Äôm more of a tiny white duck kinda guy.
‚ÄúI got it! On only my second try!‚Äù
Hey... that's mine.
This is a premature mountain lion, he's the size of big dogs! Best instagram account out there
He‚Äôs not that good at it.
It's Messi!!
In the wild stuffys don't hide under buckets I have no real world experiences
Well he‚Äôs not playing it very well, is he?
I like how people make accounts just to repost videos for karmaü§¶
good steve french
Trying to make his cat brain think like that! When the mouse runs behind the rock, the rock doesn‚Äôt move! üòÇ
Very adorable but doesn't appear to be the best at guessing where the toy is.
I couldn‚Äôt imagine my arm after playing with this cutie üòå

Now I need a mountain-lion.
awwwwwwwww haha he is so proud and happy!

Nope
Messi!!
It‚Äôs a giraffe!!
I‚Äôd love to have a Big‚Äôole kitty like that.
why does somebody have a mountain lion living in their apartment?
It would‚Äôve been a lot funnier if the puma just got pissed and ate the dude
So it didn't end up with the kitty getting pissed and ripping an arm off?
Make it disappear and he will rip your neck off.
Why would you risk pissing off a giant mountain lion?!
All fun and games until decides you are gonna be his new toy..
Love how everyone naturally just knows his name like ‚Äúoh yeah Messi this and that...‚Äù as if it‚Äôs common knowledge
I really just can‚Äôt comprehend how he can‚Äôt keep track of that. What part of the brain do we have and they don‚Äôt?
Baby lion
No. Not cute. This mountain lion was bought, not a rescue. Rescues shouldn't even be living indoors either.
Flips the last bucket to reveal an even bigger stuffed toy that's the same as the one the lion has.
He's doing awfully mean things to his favourite stuffed friend.
Why do you have mountain lion as a pet?
Cobra kai
Who knew they made stuffed toys from ballistic Kevlar.
This is actually a very small mountain lion.
Watching that killing machine play with a stuffed toy just tickles me..
He keeps messing around with his stuffed toy and this guy will be his new toy. üòÇ
"that's a nice little kitty you got there!"
1st half of the video: "Awwwww what a sweet kitty, he's just like my lil baby."

2nd half: "I am in danger just watching this"
I thought it to be **Bigger**
That's one huge, muscular cat.
Aww, he‚Äôs dumb.
Stupid cat
Hmmm looks like a potentially dangerous game to me but the mountain lion is of course beautiful
Mountain lion
Pretty kitty üòÇ
This sort of reminds me of my fave Chris Rock bit where he's talking about Sigfried and Roy's tiger who attacked them. He's went on something like, "everybody is saying the tiger went crazy. The tiger didn't go crazy - it went tiger!"
He's not giant. And he can smell the toy. I'm impressed.
We don't have to worry about animals taking over the world anytime soon. So stupid hahaha
It‚Äôs a cat dog
What an idiot. I got it on the first guess.
Aww he‚Äôs cute and dumb
Aaw he is just a big kitty!
You can tell after the first bucket gets flipped he's like, "oh shit what? Where'd it go?"
That exact toy is at my house
This actually brings up a really good survival tip. If you're ever being chased by a mountain lion, what you want to do is get under a giant blue bucket and then... move a little bit.
Lol cats
Ha ha, that cat is so stup‚Äî a ferocious killing machine!
I love how he turns into a silly kitty soon as he gets his toy.
Plot twist:

Mountain lion discovers favorite toy missing from expected hiding spot, rips off human's face in rage. Mountain lion now has new favorite toy.
its steve french
He second guesses him self. Believe in you intuition, mountain lion. Trust your feelings.
Dumb lion
When you play the shell game with a lion you let the lion win.
I could‚Äôve watched a few more rounds of this, does mountain lion ever get the hang of it?
Rip stuffed toy
I now need more videos of big cats behaving like house cats.
Survival of the fittest not the smartest and dats why lul
He got heckin' bamboozled
If there was one animal I could ethically own  it would  be some sort  of big cat.  A cougar  or black leopard  would be the shit.
I fooled my dog countless times into thinking I threw the stick.

Until one day he didn't turn no more, just kept staring at me. He was like "I'm done with your shit Ethan".
So a couple years back I was at a zoo and there's a couple of mountain lions and it's like "Oh, cool, mountain lions. I'd totally like to have one as a pet." Then one of the mountain lions saw a small child not looking at it, went into stealth mode, stalked down the rock it was sitting on, absolutely silently made its way across the fenced area, got near where the kid was standing, and pounced right into the fence. Not like face-first or anything but absolutely saying "Yeah, I'd fuck you up if it weren't for this fence and there's nothing you can do about it. ISN'T THAT FUNNY?!?"

I no longer want a mountain lion.
He sure loves it!! I just love these animals!!!
Rip whoever's job it is to take that toy back.
That‚Äôs Steve French!
"giant" .....


Sorry to say, he's actually quite small of a mountain lion
Don't mess with him, give him his toy

Looks like someone doesn't have object permanence.
I want one
When it was empty I was like uh ohhh
this video desperately needs sound
hmm. guess my cat isnt much difference than this one, besides the size lol
I was fully expecting that raised paw to swipe across the guy's face when the bucket was tipped back down over the toy.
Dumbass Simba
You see, the mountain lion didnt lose, if he did, the guy wouldnt live another day
that‚Äôs the cutest thing ever
Messi!!
What a dumbass
TIL mountain lions wouldn‚Äôt last a day in the big city.
lol why is he so bad at this? most housecats are really good at this game
Reveal one of the empty buckets and ask if he'd like to change his answer.
So what you‚Äôre telling me is that if I want to survive, I need three large ass buckets..... and a lil switcheroo and this fierce hunter has no idea where I am. Good to know.
This cat has a better mustache than me.

Imagine living below that and hearing the bonking of him falling on ground and you go up there and knock to complain see the cat apologize and go back down
Uh. There is a giant mountain lion. In the room. With a human.
Big cat is still a kitten
I like this because it shows he‚Äôs a cat just like my little orange tabby cat. Same movements and everything. Just, more enormous and deadly.
Do not tease the wild animal with three inch claws.
