This would be super easy to turn into a cross stitch pattern, I would think, since it‚Äôs already pixelated. You could do it or commission someone to make it for you so you‚Äôll always have it.Man, that SRAM battery is a real trooper.

I'd highly recommend getting the pictures you wanna keep off of there one way or another, I doubt they'll be there for much longer.Dont forget to print it off with the Gameboy printer![deleted]NintendogI had a similar experience a few years ago when I found my sister's Gameboy Camera.

I saw a picture of my childhood cockatiel and a family friend who recently passed away. It hit me hard.This picture hit me hard[deleted]the arrangement of those shitty pixels will never mean anything close to what it means to you. that little chunk of information, just sitting there, that you nonchalantly created. fucking incredible. i am happy this brought you tears of joy and brought back memories that were probably put on the back-burner of your mind to steam away. its the little things.

cheers.She looked like the best girl ever. ‚ù§I thought I saw ‚Äúgood boy‚Äù instead of ‚Äúgame boy‚Äù but then I realized that I was seeing bothGuess we are just gonna cry todayIf you could take a picture with no light reflection, to make my job easier and send me it I would like to try and convert this to a smoother black and white for you if that's ok?

I know how important our good girls/boys are.

I am off work wednesday Thursday. Hopefully this doesnt get buried in commentsHeckin good boyAw shucks you made me cry and go find my dog so i could hug her. That picture is such a great moment in time. He was probably laying next to you on the floor watching you play gameboy when you thought of taking this picture.Such a beauty. Looks a lot like my Ella Rose. The photo is almost identical too. I hope you see it and it gives you the warm and fuzzies.  https://imgur.com/a/pKbQrbiGSP?

He's in no rush, so don't hurry, but he'll be there when you get there too.So cool! I still have the memory card from my old flip phone with pictures like this. No Instagram filters can compare.this is sad, really sad if this had 1 more sad part I would cry, as the years get older we remember them more often and remember the good times  we had. We will remember all of our old friends in our heart. We will never forget them we think of the times we got them what they looked like what they acted like. and when we need them the most. We will love them, always.It‚Äôs ok man. One day you‚Äôll be reunited with him for sure.jesus christ, that must have been sweet and heartbreaking at the same time. It's a cool thing to show your kid.

On another note I feel old af, that gameboy came out when I was in my teens, I remember playing donkey Kong on my game boy waiting for highway lights so I could see what I was doing. To think we have switch now is mind blowing when you put all of it in perspective.She was lucky to have someone who loved her that much!üòøI grew up with my dog named Lucy.... when I got a little older and bought my home, I got another dog, similar size and build to Lucy. Her name is Sophie.

Anyways, recently, like for the last month or so, I've been referring to Sophie as "Lucy" accidentally(I've had Sophie for 4 years so it's sort of out of nowhere). I always catch myself, but then I wonder for about 30 seconds why suddenly I'm doing that. 

I like to think it's because Sophie is Lucy. Probably makes me a crazy person, but who cares?

On the other hand I smoke a lot of weed, so it could be that.Make a duplicate and push it through a google enhancement filterIf you could get this printed it would be awesomeA pretty nice photo too!!! There are tutorials out there for copying those photos off the Gameboy card if you want a copy of it.GOOD BOYMore like Good Boy ColorI woulda cried like a little bitch if I found something like thatThis picture made me so sad and nostalgic.

Thank youWhen I got my GB Camera 2 years ago from a thrift store I found a lot of photos from the previous owner. They looked like photos from around 8th grade students, and who knows from when. It was pretty weird but also interesting. Ended up deleting them for privacy reasons (I shouldn't have 15 year old photos of random 8th grade students) but it was interesting.Weird, I saw a non pixelated version of this picture yesterday.

Having a toy camera for the gameboy wasn't the best but you probably took pictures you wouldn't have bothered with otherwise and now like he was with pics of his wife now you get to see your pal from 1999 :)Omg. That would be like a punch to the gut but a good one... is there a good punch to the gut? Yep, this is it.I remember I found this game in an old drawer and turned it on after at least 20 years of it sitting there.

There are a few different ways to do it but the main hardware i use is the bitboy. It acts like the gameboy printer but instead sends the image to an sd card which you can then manipulate on your pc or phone. (https://gameboyphoto.bigcartel.com/product/bitboy).

Well except if you have tons of picture of that good boy.I'm not crying you're cryingThese always the saddest and happiest pictures. I recently found an old hard driver from the mid 00s to 2013 and it had so many videos and pictures of two of the dogs and cats that have passed since that time and I was crying tears of joy snd sadness!

Also pretty sure the wulfden on youtuber has videos on getting them off the gameboy. He takes tons of photos with the game boy camera.Oooof feelsMax respect!!!**Cries in black and white**I bought a second-hand Game Boy Camera. Took a couple of pictures of my cats.

This makes me glad that I am able to take lots of photos of my BFFF.There‚Äôs gotta be a way to read the SDRAM of the cartridge so this memory can be saved, it would be a shame if it were lost.Hey OP, if you can take a more evenly lit photo (full brightness on the Gameboy, no other lights in the room, no flash, highest res photo possible), I'd like to take a stab at extracting the pixels for you.Frame this!I have a tool that can pull the images from your camera.
