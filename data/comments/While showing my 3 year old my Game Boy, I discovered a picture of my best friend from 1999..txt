This would be super easy to turn into a cross stitch pattern, I would think, since it‚Äôs already pixelated. You could do it or commission someone to make it for you so you‚Äôll always have it.
Man, that SRAM battery is a real trooper.

I'd highly recommend getting the pictures you wanna keep off of there one way or another, I doubt they'll be there for much longer.
Dont forget to print it off with the Gameboy printer!

I had a similar experience a few years ago when I found my sister's Gameboy Camera.

I saw a picture of my childhood cockatiel and a family friend who recently passed away. It hit me hard.
This picture hit me hard

the arrangement of those shitty pixels will never mean anything close to what it means to you. that little chunk of information, just sitting there, that you nonchalantly created. fucking incredible. i am happy this brought you tears of joy and brought back memories that were probably put on the back-burner of your mind to steam away. its the little things.

cheers.
She looked like the best girl ever. ‚ù§
I thought I saw ‚Äúgood boy‚Äù instead of ‚Äúgame boy‚Äù but then I realized that I was seeing both
Guess we are just gonna cry today
If you could take a picture with no light reflection, to make my job easier and send me it I would like to try and convert this to a smoother black and white for you if that's ok?

I know how important our good girls/boys are.

I am off work wednesday Thursday. Hopefully this doesnt get buried in comments
Heckin good boy
Aw shucks you made me cry and go find my dog so i could hug her. That picture is such a great moment in time. He was probably laying next to you on the floor watching you play gameboy when you thought of taking this picture.
Such a beauty. Looks a lot like my Ella Rose. The photo is almost identical too. I hope you see it and it gives you the warm and fuzzies.  https://imgur.com/a/pKbQrbi

So cool! I still have the memory card from my old flip phone with pictures like this. No Instagram filters can compare.
this is sad, really sad if this had 1 more sad part I would cry, as the years get older we remember them more often and remember the good times  we had. We will remember all of our old friends in our heart. We will never forget them we think of the times we got them what they looked like what they acted like. and when we need them the most. We will love them, always.
It‚Äôs ok man. One day you‚Äôll be reunited with him for sure.
jesus christ, that must have been sweet and heartbreaking at the same time. It's a cool thing to show your kid.

On another note I feel old af, that gameboy came out when I was in my teens, I remember playing donkey Kong on my game boy waiting for highway lights so I could see what I was doing. To think we have switch now is mind blowing when you put all of it in perspective.
She was lucky to have someone who loved her that much!

I grew up with my dog named Lucy.... when I got a little older and bought my home, I got another dog, similar size and build to Lucy. Her name is Sophie.

Anyways, recently, like for the last month or so, I've been referring to Sophie as "Lucy" accidentally(I've had Sophie for 4 years so it's sort of out of nowhere). I always catch myself, but then I wonder for about 30 seconds why suddenly I'm doing that. 

I like to think it's because Sophie is Lucy. Probably makes me a crazy person, but who cares?

On the other hand I smoke a lot of weed, so it could be that.
Make a duplicate and push it through a google enhancement filter
If you could get this printed it would be awesome
A pretty nice photo too!!! There are tutorials out there for copying those photos off the Gameboy card if you want a copy of it.
GOOD BOY

I woulda cried like a little bitch if I found something like that
This picture made me so sad and nostalgic. Was your best friend a German Shorthaired Pointer? Because your dog looks exactly like my dog who passed away last year because of a car accident and just seeing this post made me very emotional. I'll remember this post for a very long time.
Damn guys everything really went to shit after 911 didn't it. I miss those days.

Keep it forever. I had a dog for my whole life until I was 11 he died a week after my birthday and I collected every picture I had of him and put them into one big folder. It‚Äôs always sad to look at them but it can cheer me up as well.
No lie.. I remember seeing this picture somewhere else before this..

I almost want to say that it was a stock image that came with the camera or the printer..

When I got my GB Camera 2 years ago from a thrift store I found a lot of photos from the previous owner. They looked like photos from around 8th grade students, and who knows from when. It was pretty weird but also interesting. Ended up deleting them for privacy reasons (I shouldn't have 15 year old photos of random 8th grade students) but it was interesting.
Weird, I saw a non pixelated version of this picture yesterday. Huh.
how much did you cry?

My moms German shorthair pointer just passed away a few weeks ago. She was old and had cancer but she was wild till the day she died!
Smile you‚Äôre on game boy camera
Gameboy Camera may not be the best but its like the youtuber 8-bit guy once said about his first webcam from the early 90s, he took pictures he wouldn't have otherwise because he didn't have to develop the film. Having a toy camera for the gameboy wasn't the best but you probably took pictures you wouldn't have bothered with otherwise and now like he was with pics of his wife now you get to see your pal from 1999 :)
Omg. That would be like a punch to the gut but a good one... is there a good punch to the gut? Yep, this is it.
I remember I found this game in an old drawer and turned it on after at least 20 years of it sitting there. I found numerous selfies from when me and my siblings were super young and my heart dropped when I saw them. It was honestly a weird feeling.
Fuck me man.

I found my game boy camera about 6 months back, it had a picture of my late father on it.
"Daddy, why you crying?" 

"(Sniffs) I'm not crying baby (wipes eyes with sleeves)"

"It's ok Daddy (wipes tears from cheek)"
One of those you have loved along the way.
I‚Äôve never seen something so worthy of getting tatooed.
Thanks for making me cry.

It‚Äôs enough to make a grown man cry
For those wondering how they got a picture on there...  back in the late 90‚Äôs Nintendo came out with a game cartridge that had a camera called Game Boy Camera. It had activities you could do along with the picture you took with your gameboy. If I recall correctly you could even print it out.
German shorthair painter?  I had one the same time, she was also my best friend.. Still till this date best dog ever! Mollie was the goodest girlüò≠

This really hits me hard. My best friend is putting down his childhood dog today, and I don't know how to cope. It's so sad how we outlive our animals, but I hope we can at least give them good lives to make up for it.
He's been waiting since '99. This gives me some sad Jurassic bark vibes.
It hit me right in the feels. Loved the picture
This is so sweet.  <3
Remember when life's most difficult choice was deciding whether to play Goldeneye or Super Smash Brothers at your buddy's house because your mom said that you could stay the night?
Nice, when I turned on my only Game Boy Color recently and loaded up Super Mario, there was a message that said "FUQ YOU" from my 10 year old self.
That‚Äôs an amazing find and time capsule!!!
How come it says Gameboy colour? I don't see no colour!

You can transfer the image to an sd card! I do this to make gameboy camera photography on instagram and so do others. There are a few different ways to do it but the main hardware i use is the bitboy. It acts like the gameboy printer but instead sends the image to an sd card which you can then manipulate on your pc or phone. (https://gameboyphoto.bigcartel.com/product/bitboy). 
Check out #gameboycamera on instagram to get an idea of what you would gey. Id be glad to help out too if you're willing to mail the system to me. Just DM me.

Oh how time passes... we lose things we love so quickly... we never know when we are gonna see someone for the last time... your pupper is a good boy and he's in heaven. Dont even say that dogs dont go to heaven because you're braindead.
I'm 8 months pregnant crying like a baby over this beautiful pupper! Also I'm 110% that even if I wasn't preggo I would still be bawling over how beautiful this picture is. Makes me think of my old pups that protected me when I was a kid!
Could be done into a really cool bead art, then framed!

Wonder if there is other colorful photo of your old friend?

I am so curious about what the color he is.
Not sure if you felt joy or heartbreak, or just surprise, but I hope you will save it somewhere else.

Well except if you have tons of picture of that good boy.
I'm not crying you're crying
These always the saddest and happiest pictures. I recently found an old hard driver from the mid 00s to 2013 and it had so many videos and pictures of two of the dogs and cats that have passed since that time and I was crying tears of joy snd sadness!

Also pretty sure the wulfden on youtuber has videos on getting them off the gameboy. He takes tons of photos with the game boy camera.
Oooof feels
Max respect!!!
**Cries in black and white**
I bought a second-hand Game Boy Camera. Took a couple of pictures of my cats. Went to the gallery and realised that the previous owner had left pictures on there.

They were also pictures of cats.
just checkin in on ya
I can't imagine the feeling of just randomly discovering this üò≠
This would seriously be a big flashback of memories for you!

I'm glad you got this reminder.
This makes me glad that I am able to take lots of photos of my BFFF.
There‚Äôs gotta be a way to read the SDRAM of the cartridge so this memory can be saved, it would be a shame if it were lost.
Hey OP, if you can take a more evenly lit photo (full brightness on the Gameboy, no other lights in the room, no flash, highest res photo possible), I'd like to take a stab at extracting the pixels for you.
Frame this!
I have a tool that can pull the images from your camera. If you would like to pm me we can work out shipping stuff around. 
Jrodgrigo on tindie makes the tool I think.
how‚Äôd you get the picture on there? did it have a back camera?? (jk) but seriously how?

Wait..... how? :-S

The picture is over 20 years old, so I'm guessing that good boy is chasing its tail in heaven.  
This is so wholesome (and a bit sad). This had to hit you in the chest when you opened the gallery.
Who the fuck is chopping onions in here?
This is beyond wholesome.
I would genuinely want to have this picture framed and kept. It perfectly captures an era of my life where my dog was my best friend and most of my days were spent playing gameboy by myself. Thanks for sharing this.

immortalized inside a piece of childhood treasure item. I feel like i can hear some 8bit music theme that goes along with this picture.
Everyone talking about how he might lose the picture now.... even though we‚Äôre all looking at on our phones across the world....
Oh, it's the new Nintendo Goodboy!
Ninfriendo

Game Boy and his Goodest Boy
I know the pain of losing a beloved pet. Never goes away.
You could take photos with it? I never knew that. I had GBA was that a thing?
I miss my gameboy camera...
Gave **Wholesome**

It works?
Good boy color...

Ok I'm crying this is so wholesome!

That's depressing
Lmfao that made me laugh. Sorry tho
Dang, I‚Äôm surprised you took a clean picture like that on the GBC
...nineteen ninety nine, bizarre summer...
How did the picture get on the game boy?
I did not know you could take photos on Gameboy, what models could do this?
Nice
üòç
I had that same color Gameboy and remember (and was thinking about it last week) a picture of my cat from my childhood. Fist bump for Nintendo nostalgia.
It almost enough to make a grown man cry
Get back in there tear

Goodest time capsule ever!
Here I am trying to figure out what game this is from before looking again.

Oh man that is heartbreakingly sweet
Omg so sweet I could cry! I always thought those gameboy cameras were hoaky, but that picture makes it obvious that they're actually time capsules!
Nintendo 
Good boy
Finally after all these years... the Game Boy camera is vindicated.
Aww my heart. That would be such a sweet find. I don't have any pictures of my old family dog, she was with me since I was a baby and passed when I was about 15.
My tiny heart can‚Äôt take this
Right in the feels </3
Oh my... This hit hard. He looks like my old buddy whom I grew up with. Sad and happy tears rolling on

Gameboy camera memories just came flooding back.
Awww
Is this a Vizsla?
That is probably the most precious GB thing I've ever seen.
I would be so emotional
Awww
That's why I try to love my 13 yr old beagle.... not easy at times thooo they're a mess
Cute Dogger!
German short haired pointer? Anyway lovely!
That's a whole lot of wholesomeness and feels
How did you do that?
Before these small devices became popular the term "game boy" had a totally different connotation.
This is sad for me for some reason
*presses the 'F' key on their keyboard*
What a joy it must have been to find this. And bittersweet too.
