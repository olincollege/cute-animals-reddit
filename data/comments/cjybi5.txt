I’m impressed your work boots last that long
Whats the breed of dog? This photo looks exactly like my dog (maybe alittle younger) and we dont know his breed because he was a rescue!
His feet to big for he got damn boot
You need new boots
From Ewok to Wookiee in just 3 years.
Same boot but is it also same dog?
That chair did not age well
Don't know how to tell you this, but your room and boot shrunk.
Left pic looks like your pup was a coal miner forced into child labor
r/justbootthings
/r/boottoobig
He boot 2 big for he gotdamn feet
What kind of boot is that?
Das Boot
Did your boot magically shrink?
That boot is sick, can I get the name?
I see you've changed The Chair.
I'm going to say "Same Puppy/Dog
The white looking "star" when he/she was a pup is STILL THERE!. It just grew. BTW, your German Shepherd is above and beyond "Beautiful As Hell"
They have always been the best part of millions and millions of people who just sincerely love 
German Shepherds. Love the baby post. No doubt it's real. ;)
I think you forgot to feed the chair...
Looks like a good idea for a Pokémon.

"Your STOMPUP evolved into BOOTMUTT"
A cat would try to fit in the boot like it did before
As a puppy, it's like "why am I in a boot? Is this my new life?"

As a dog it's like "why am I in a boot? is this another of your stupid...yep, there's the camera again."  


Resigned love in both cases.
My heart cant handle this. It is too cute.
You'd think s/he would have learnt to untie laces by now. Would help getting that boot on easier.
You should put this on social media and tag the bookmaker.  They might re-post this, it’s so cute!
r/boottoobig (on left anyway)
Congrats on the new chair!
This dog is too cute. I think my heart is gonna explode:o
You can tell it's the same boot, because of the way it is.
r/bootTOObig
r/boottoobig
Beautiful dog!
he boot about the right size for he gotdamn feet
This is why you should shake your boots before you put them on, never know if some spider or something has made it a home
time just flies so fast.
Ouchhhhh he cute
Different chair.
r/JustBootThings
I see you got a new chair. Think I like the old one better.
Damn...your boots shrunk
The boot aged well
I know where the treat is in the second pic
The boot has shrunk. Wow.
So it's not the same doge?
Why do drugs when you could buy hundreds of dogs?
Same boot, different dog.
First off, why has he worn that boot for 3 years. Second, get him some new boots. Cmon now..
Pic 1: Boot to big
Poc 2: Boot still to big but we're getting there
I can't handle the fact he was that smol..!!!! 😭😭😭
So when can we see them combined to transform into the cutest shoe pup ever
Cute
ThAt puper
Stahhhp itttt! My heart!
Precious!  Nothing like an animal friend!
Time flys by so fast ;(
That's beautiful <3
Looks like the shoe didn’t get a growth spurt
Pooch n’ boots
This..does put a smile on my face.
He looks like "Why the Fuck do you want me to put my foot in your measly boot, Dave?"
Aww I love German Shepherd dogs. My uncle had such a friendly one and I've loved them ever since!
The dogs cute, but what happened to the baby ewok?
There’s a good boy in your boot!
Recently my 6 year old german shepherd passed away and I think i have shed a tear when I saw this post, I always wanted a dog to accompany me for a long time.
I'm sorry about your shrinking boot, OP.
Thank god there was no 3'rd picture with just the boot.
That boot shrank tremendously.
Are GSDs the only breed where the coat color can change so much or is that all puppies and I’ve never noticed?
If I fits, I sits vs. Meh, this'll have to do...
Damn that looks a lot like my old dog, he died last year but we adopted him when he was 4. I always wondered what he might have looked like as a pup.
I think he needs a reboot
i think ur boot shrunk in the wash
I didn't know you could reboot pets.
Not sure if r/aww or r/buyitforlife
Lil dude ran out of ink while growing
That explains his previous smolness.
Wow that boot looks old.
I would love to do this with my dog, but he chewed my boots up.
Fuckin boots!!
Such a handsome big boy!
puppy in the boot is the best thing ive seen in a long time
Same boot, same dog, same floor, same chair ,same photographer
Wish I could keep a set of boots that long...
rather, same dog
Schoner hund!
Incredible! Where can I get this boot shrinking technology?!
If he was a Canadian Shepard, he would be wondering what's all this picture taking is aboot.
From boot too big to boot too smol
The pup out grew his snoot.
This is so cute
What a silly dog it’s on the wrong paw, but still cute
Same boot goofin'
watching a dog grow is just a majestic thing to witness
I admire dogs who last long with stuff... a boot like that would last a day with my dog
My heart skipped multiple beats.
Reminds me of a song I used to play on the piano in kindergarten. "When my dog was a pup he could fit in a cup. Now you see he is three and as big as me!"
Go check out that supermutant boy!
He too big for he got dam boot...
how do we know you didn't shrink your boots
You really shouldn’t wash your boots on warm and dry hot.  Poor dog can barely fit in it now.
The face one current age: Is there a treat involved?
lol I have a picture of my great dane in a stocking when she was a pup. I tried to do a similar picture with her last year... she wasn't having it.
I wish we would have done this with our puppy when we brought him home in April. Love this idea!
I just fell in love. With and Army dog!
What a beauty!
This is all what its aboot
That boot has held up well over the years.
His grown up face looks like my Pomeranian Chihuahua mix haha!
Pupper did a hecking big grow.
OMG adorable!!! I want one too
The dog changed colors. That’s racist and i’m offended
But is it the same dog?
R
Boot too small
Hard to believe. So amazing when the photos are side-by-side.
He boot too big for he gotdamn feet
different chair
Your chair on the other hand has aged *terribly*.
I just squeaked in the middle of Walmart and some staff looked at me like wtf
I wants a german shepard so fucking bad!!!
Same boot..
But what about the dog?
Can we get a look at the boot without the dog in the way?
So adorable!
Dogmeat looks so cute in this picture!
I see that the chair in the background has taking a chewing as well
Different chair
Awwww
What a beautiful dog
Looks like a GSD mixed with a border collie. Beautiful!
Beautiful!
Base mascots are unauthorized, guy
I dunno why but I get really emotional when I see stuff like this.

Same with the lab and his shelf that he grow out off.
AWWWWWWWWWW this is too precious
They grow so fast what a beautiful dog
Fuck i want a german shep so bad :(
Dude our dog had puppies around that time while she was stray, and looks shockingly like yours, even the hair patterns are eerie close
Wow your boot got a lot smaller over time
Aww what a freaking cutie!!  I want that puppachino!!!
Awwww it was so small when it was a baby! Cute！
Fit like a glove.
Nice
What type of dog are they? Looks like German Shepherd mix!
That’s fucking adorable.
I just like how the boot looks better in the after picture.  (Probably due to the angle)
Dog: are you hinting that I am Fat?
Same chair, 3 years later
What brand is this?
How did you keep him in the boot for 3 years?
goddamn that is cutest little button i have ever seen
Oh no! The big dog is stepping on the puppy!
Get too close to her kids, and mama’s gonna throw hooves. “Every move you make, every breath you take, I’m no doctor but to my knowledge, it’s an indoor cat it’s the same way. It’s been like that for seven years. It makes it really hard to get out of the shower...
"but dad, this shoe is on the wrong foot..."
Doh.
Back then he too small now he too big
Thank you soo much for the gold and silver! Just to clear up some things, yes he's the same dog, he is a German Shepherd cross Dingo hence why hes got lighter fur (red in the sun). He is amazing and such a clever boy, i love him to bits and he gets very spoilt!
some of you should feel ashamed of yourselves.maybe the owner of the boots got hurt and is now on disability .you don't know so don't jump to conclusions, it just makes you look like an idiot.
Is it an Australian Sheppard/German Sheppard mix? He is so handsome.
Woody: "There's a dog in my boot"
Is it the same dog?
Is this buyitforlife?
Boots on the wrong paw.
He's really done a number on that chair!
/r/wellworn?
How do you get karma
Lying ass one boot has a strap the other doesn't and those are two completely different dogs...
Awww, hes so cute
It's a port key!
He is still not thrilled for the pic after 3 years.
He booted to big for he gottdamn him
BIGGER boot!
Boot for size
Smol boy
Same chair 3 yrs later
You are a dog. 


They don’t even fit.
Awww
r/eyebleach
I know puppies color tend to change a lot, but it’s funny... he is so gorgeous and such a unique color now but he looked so dark before that I would’ve never known it’s the same pup!
& same setup, 3 years later
By specifying the same boot you imply a different pupper.......
Someone Amélied the shit out of you
Why is my foot in boot.
That's cute
Just cute <3
It still fits ^^^^^^^^^^somehow , he still sits.
as dirty as 3 years before :)
Same boot different dog
Life goals!!! This is sooo fucking adorable.
Daas boot
Now the pupper is old enough to drink.
It's that a Georgia Giant boot?
It's on the wrong paw
r/boottoosmall
Might wanna tell the big guy to get his hand out of that boot so the little guy can breathe some. 

3 years of this you say?
Steel blue boots 100% comfort for whatever game you're in.
The left picture is cracking me up.  He looks almost... Humanoid.  Like those people with the furry face disease.
He boot too big for his goddamn feet
New chair?
That's not even the same doggo!! What did you do with the pupper????
/r/justbootthings
This dog is too cute.
Face looks like Tony Stark
Nice
Same boot, new chair! I get it.
What kind of boots are those?
What a beautiful dog! I don’t think I’ve ever seen a German Shepard with such a light colored coat! So cute.
Yeah but different dog
I have shrinking boots too, it bites!
Same boot, same snoot
What happened to the first dog??????
Omg perfect
Same chair too?
r/boottoobig

R/boottobig

His right paw is in the left boot, bruh
not sure which one is cuter, but I'm partial to the groweded up one
Such a beauty.
Dude, your  Ewok evolved into a shepherd
Love German Shepherds
wheres the pc tho
They look cleaner and less damaged than the new pic. Same model boot? Dope pic
Not to be overdramatic or anything but I would die for him
The real question here is WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHAIR!?!?!
Oh nooooo....
Pretty!
Your boot shrunk!
Little woofer to big boi
He went from the size of his paw to controling the paw
Sounds like you had a three year pause for effect.

Sorry not sorry.
#Different chair
Same look of why the fuck am I in this boot
Aw fuzzy German Sheps are the cutest
He's back in his old stomping grounds.
How do you get a boot to shrink that well?
You put his shoe on backwards
Are those steel toe ? If so what are they , I need me some of them
DOG IN BOOTS
such a cute boot, aww
that boot really shrunk
He knows what he likes.
How did you shrink your boot?
Get new boots, bro. They shrunk look at the pic the dog fit in the boot first, and now just his paw fits duh. Get new boots, bro!
It’s astonishing how quickly they grow up. My coworker didn’t bring her aussiedoodle puppy in for three weeks and he looks like an entirely different dog!
Cute
If the boot fits.
Cute
Naaahhh different shoe
So cute what a great idea
but different chair???
wow it's hard to believe it's the same boot...did you leave it out in the rain?
You’re gonna need a bigger boot
"wow, look at how much the boot has shrunken!"
I like how you whittled away at the chair in the background so it aged too
What a cutie! Surprised he never chewed the shoe up.
don't work much ,huh?
Aww so cute they should do more of these
Been humping the same boot
Unpopular opinion: adult dogs are cuter than puppies
Your boot shrunk
Cute little  doge
I love GSD's
Those are his shoes. [https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/882/381px-Thosearemyshoes.jpg](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/882/381px-Thosearemyshoes.jpg)
Cats are superior.
What a beautiful doggo.
Your boot has shrinked...
My absolute favorite dog that I have ever owned chewed up the top of my favorite pair of boots. I where them with pride. I love them even more now. When my dog is gone. I’ll always have something to remember her by.
Bootiful
That is a gorgeous, beautiful dog. (All dogs are beautiful but this one is beutifuller than most.) I love the expression on his/her face in both photos! The first one is "am I doing this right?" The second one is kindly and patiently humoring your odd request, because they love you.
The boot looks like its in better condition in the second picture
R/goodyearwelt good lord clean them thangs
You ought to get a refund on those boots - after all, they are supposed to be shink proof. Right?
Ewok to Wookie
Wow those boots got really small!
Well I'll be, ain't that just adorable.
Wtf did you do to your boot
Aww
Man, leather sure does shrink when exposed to water /s
…...I love this man....
I love your dog!

Ok but is it the same dog? We wanna know! We need answers!!! Answer me you inbred!
Seems like the boot shrank. Do you still have the receipt? Maybe you can get a replacement.
Wrong foo- you know what never mind you are the most adorable
Wow, the boot shrank real good

So cute
Aw he is wearing the shoe on the wrong foot!
Beautiful, lovable..
As Pup: "I am boot."

As Big Dog: "Human, why did you put my paw in a boot?"
Love the dog. Hate the fact it should be the left paw in the boot.
What does that mean in got some brain trouble
r/paww
That's AMAZING :D :D
Aw
Rip desk
<3
that must be one good quality boot to last that long !
Why does he look like nic cage in the first pic
Different chair though
time flew so fast
So, even after all these years, the boot still fits the doggo ...
What did you use to shrink the boot down to that size?
Nice
It's actually the opposite boot lols
Oh how I love this!!!! So Precious!!
r/JustBootThings
r/boottoobig
Omgosh yesh
Not quite sure what I’m sorry for but I’m sorry I didn’t mean upset you
OP, what breed is that a mix of? Our dog looks EXACTLY like that and we can't figure out what she is. We were thinking possibly a Belgian Tervuren. We got her from a shelter and clearly she isn't a full blood German Shepherd. We want another dog just like her. [https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/belgian-tervuren#/slide/1](https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/belgian-tervuren#/slide/1)
D'aww!
I saw this in new! Knew it would get to hot , ur dog is so adorable
The guy is a fraud the dog in the second picture is more than three years old since the muzzel of dogs doesnt go grey until they are grandpa doggos
He tried!
He went from

He boot to big for he god damn he

To

He foot to big for he god damn feet
I wonder if there is a way to transfer the smell to larger object so the pet will be willing to move to said larget object
Roses are red
Sugar is sweet
He boot too big for he gotdamn feet

Wow your boot really shrunk in 3 years 😂
