He looks so happy! 
I had a chef at one of my colleges who knew his customers. 99% of the student body would get chicken strips. There would be forty people in line and he'd just point at you and say "Strips?" and you'd just nod your head.

One day he pointed at me and didn't say "Strips?" so I said it for him. He said "I ain't strippin for you."

Guy was a hoot.
How wholesome. Looks like a very nice dude. Very huggable. 10/10 would buy pizza from
[Insert College I recognize here] represent!
To the Victor go the spoils!
That pizza looks loaded too!

Hickok45 makes pizzas on the side. TIL
But where is the hand and the white hat
awww! i hope he’s being paid well too.
I think every college has an employee who’s been there forever and is basically a universally beloved figure on campus. Here’s my college’s version: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2018/08/04/she-delivered-award-winning-customer-service-when-no-one-was-looking-heres-what-happened-next/#5bedf1031960](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2018/08/04/she-delivered-award-winning-customer-service-when-no-one-was-looking-heres-what-happened-next/#5bedf1031960) 
He looks like a guy that can make a hell of a pizza.

[Now it's fixed](https://i.imgur.com/HdmdShn.jpg)
This is great! What university?

The University I attended, Shenandoah (in Virginia, USA) could do the same for their longtime breakfast master, Reggie---perhaps: Reggie's Diner! Specializing in ham & cheese omelettes with extra cheese that are ready the second you enter the cafeteria after your 8am music theory class!

We LOVED that man!
Stuff like this makes employees happy. 
Pizza time

Hey guys, come have a bowl of pizza!  
Face on the sign reads “this was just suppose to be a summer job 30 years ago” 
r/2healthbars
I'm sure he'd appreciate a raise more than a sign, but I suppose we have to start somewhere.
Kudos to the Chef! <3 Love pizza <3 
Woah this was a trip, I know who made that sign lmao
Still makes $12/hr without health benefits?
but did he get a raise? 
Aww
I am hopeful that they are also paying him well for using his likeness and name and not just doing it to "credit" him.
Come for the pizza, stay for the education!
Hell yeah. I'd go there knowing you get him smiling and slingin delicious pizza slices. I'm sure people want pictures with him and his painting. I would. 
Did they just invent him a moustache? 
Upvoted. Food service people deserve a lot of respect. 
How much does he want per hour? I'll take ten of him.
Pizza to college kids all day? And it looks good!? A true hero. 
This is the most upvotes I have seen in awhile
This is so sweet!! He looks totally thrilled
That sucks dude....how does he drive his car without tires
That pie looks great! 
Swedish?
This warmed my heart so much, I know how it feels to be attatched to your resturaunt like that, literally putting blood sweat and tears into the food you make. Fuck yeah. Go Victor, carpe diem, the world is his now.
You have a pizza chef in your college?
Better than a pay rise thats for sure
How sweet! He looks so happy!

At one of the universities here, there was a very sweet, old lady who worked at the Carl's Jr. in the food court. She was always smiling and always really nice. One day, the students decided on a day to just give her roses. They organised a date and time, and they all lined up at the Carl's Jr., and each person was holding one rose. There were pictures of the event, and she just seemed so happy and grateful.  It was really cute.
When I was in college, the guy who ran the commons (cafeteria) was an Irish immigrant named Norm. He'd try making any request at least once if it was feasible to make for 1,000 students. He also made his mother's Irish soda bread once a week, and the line to get in would be longer than usual on those days. 

He knew every student by name, which was wonderful. This were the days when "Cheers" was on TV (created BTW by brothers Glenn and Les Charles who were alumni of our school), so anytime everyone was in the commons eating and Norm came out of the kitchen, everyone would yell "NORM!" just like the bar patrons on Cheers. 

Great guy.


I just ate but now I want pizza.
Why is this in /r/aww?
How awesome!
Get the man some tires already!
“Hey instead of giving you a raise or any sort of royalties for using your likeness here’s a fucking picture now go back to work slave”
[removed]
Soo... what college is this?

Might transfer.
ur school had a pizza chef!? michigan state university pizza sux hard
THATS WHAT WE WANT TO SEE!
Where's his toque?
Where do you go to school?
What a great illustration, dig that style! His pizza looks real good too.
I wish we had this for Omelette Guy at my school. Guy was an unsung hero
Omg this makes me so happy <3
Get this man some new tires!!!
I bet he makes some great pizza. 
That’s awesome
His sign says, "Eh, close enough, right?"
He needs the hat
Its-a me, Victor! Da pizza-a guy
Aww he looks so cute
Was he expecting it all or was it a surprise? Congrats to him! He looks so happy.
That looks like a good pie
The art version of him looks like he is going, "who the fuck is this guy?"
Looks like really cool guy
Good
Bien joué
Your college is awesome.
His cartoon image kinda looks like Geraldo Rivera.
That's awesome! My college had a line chef that became campus-famous for his omelet making skills and photographic memory. All I had to do was walk into the dining hall, give him the nod and 5 minutes later my order would be cooked to perfection. I miss you Chef Dom! I wouldn't have been able to make my college gains from 150 lbs to 220 without you! 
 Z
Reminds me of di faras pizza in new york. The pizza giys worked there everyday making pizzas for like over 40 years and they have a painting of him making pizza
I’ve been buying a lot of Papa Johns pizza lately 
Dude reminds me of Hickock45 with that passion. He looks like he loves what he does.
Did the Art students draw those Mario hands?
"We would give you a pension but we wasted the money on renaming the pizzeria"

"Oh... dammit..."
His love transmits to the pizza!!!
Mmm pizza.
r/humansbeingbros
pizza time?
Now that's job security.
he couldn't lift his left hand a little bit for the picture?

What he needs is a livable wage.
If that poster was made in illustrator, I certainly hope that makes it a victor vector. 
I hope this is at the University of Michigan (Their theme song is "The Victors")
They need to give him  a hat also
I bet this man makes some of the best damn pizza you'll ever eat. You can see the joy and love in his smile. 
This man probably been feeding students for years, i'm pretty sure all the students know him
I love it when people do things like this.. especially those people we tend to ignore; your local cashier, the guy you see at the gas station, mailman and in this case, your pizza guy. Good stuff!
It’s so weird they did a great job painting Victor, then went all 4th grader on the pizza.
The pizza he is holding looks AMAZING!
Worked pizza, time and care go into pizza you don’t just do it to do it, you learn to love it, glad to see this. 
Not only does he make great pizza, but he can really pack a scoop of ice cream down into a cone.
This is great.  
Fuck yeah
Damn that looks like good pizza nice work victor proud of you
So sweet!!! He looks so happy:)
aww he's sweet, so adorable.
The people that work for dining or janitorial staff at college are some of the nicest and most genuine people I've met here. Forming relationships with them has given me much enjoyment and laughs already.
I’m sure Victors Pizza Cafe is much better 

But it’s not a competition, at the end of the day...they’re both victors in my eyes. 
Bet he'd dig a raise even more. 
Good lord, that made me tear up and I have no idea why
Meanwhile our pizza cook father and son duo no showed yesterday and fucked us. 
Hope they're giving him a pension, too.
Sounds like he might have preferred that you spent the money on a set of tires for him.
Man, back when I was in college, all we had was Coke Nail Carlos, who worked the sandwich line, and Big Red. She looked like a 6 foot Chucky doll and threatened to tell the Dean every time you tried to sneak food out of the cafeteria...
A Man works till he's old and grey serving pizza w here's the awww I see missed opportunities the guy work at a college. What they couldn't hook him up with a degree.
Why’d they whitewash Victor?!?
They put up a sign? That passes for showing someone the credit they deserve?
It's not the same pizza as in the picture😤😤😤
so what happened to his tires?
Better job stability than 95% of the graduates will ever have, too!
Why does the portrait of Victor look more like Victor than Victor?
They painted a picture of Geraldo Rivera for him?
It's f***ing r/aww!

In all seriousness though, that's really wholesome to see.
It better be in MLA format. 
I love this! As a student, this would resonate with me and I would be more likely to purchase items because of it. Appreciation is usually close to free, except to the recipient, for whom it is worth untold riches.
The actual pizza looks so much better than the art. Its just a not very interesting pepperoni.
Someone should buy him some tires if he's tireless
How does he get to work if he is tireless? Hopefully its not a long walk for this gentleman. 
That's a fine-looking pie. And this is in your school cafeteria?!
History is written by the Victor.
After seeing this i walked around with a huge grin on my face for like 6 minutes
Victory!
This is great 
I love this. Congrats Victor! 
That's a man who enjoys his job. 
Your college has pizza?
Wait I can have my own pizzeria on a campus? UT hit me up.
Wholesome
First time i see pizza looking better than in promotional picture.
Is it just me or does the gesture he makes on the sign say "eyyyyyy, what do you want?!"
The man who makes pizza on a college campus is king. 
Mamma mia! This is cute 
GO VICTOR!!
Brilliant <3
Pizza to college kids all day? And it looks good!? A true hero. 
The benefits of having a face that looks exactly like clip art. 
We had this at my uni also! This super friendly dude named Frank used to make the burgers and hot sandwiches at our grill line so eventually, dining services started to name sandwiches after him!
Fuck yeah, Victor!
He looks *just* like the pizza guy from Billions
That pizza looks so fucking good
That looks absolutely delicious.
Now he's going to go mad with power!
# Finally!! this has probably been long awaited!!
Awww that’s the most wholesome thing I’ve seen all day 
This is ridiculously wholesome
Americans have pizza in school? :/
You had a pizza chef? We just had a random student who undercooked the bottom of the pizza dough every time.
That's a really good likeness--great job!
bitch thats Stan Lee
I dont even know Victor but i already love him
That looks like one good pizza! (I’m very hungry right now)
Say my Name

He looks like an old Heisenberg
Why no tires?
He looks like a British comedian called Jim Bowen
Where is this restaurant?
The best pizza at John Brown!
Alright Victor! Victor’s pizza should be a national brand!
He must be tireless.  Pizza at any college is more consumed than beer.  

Seems like a good guy well deserving!
This man is clearly an imposter!!! The real Victor wears a different hat.
Why can't I hold all these pizzas??
Did u ever know that your my HERO
I personally would've liked to see him holding a pepperoni pizza, and wearing the same hat and gloves.
7/10 hes not doing the hand gesture and the pizza doesnt match the picture.
This is so incredibly adorable I can barely handle it.  
r/wholesome
Yeah that sign will really help the pizza chef know what time it is. 
Rate the pizza 1-10 though, let us know if it's worth the drive. 
At my school we have Walker the sandwich guy. He's always super happy and friendly and he makes a bomb sandwich.
So how good is his pizza?
He definitely looks tired.
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie~
He looks kind of Italian. I bet his pizzas are to die for!
I want to fly across the world to buy his pizza.

&#x200B;
He looks just like the guy in the painting!
I crave pizza now
If I ever go to California I’m eating here
That's fucking awesome
That's so awesome!  And that pie looks delicious!
This is beyond wholesome
My school went the opposite way. Used to be Woody’s Coffee and now it’s a Dunkin Donuts.

Woody still works there.
if they really want to show some appreciation, they should buy him some tires. 
*Pizza time song from spiderman 2 kicks in*
where the puppies and kitties?
This is awesome. Looks well earned
That is so awesome!
shit id be happy to :) 

&#x200B;
Aw that's awesome. He has the same name as me too!
[This is all I see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFwzNYAJIV4)
He's not holding up his hand... 1/10
I just ate but now I want pizza.
Peen
He looks like Stan Lee and looks so nice!
Looks way better than High School Pizza.
GOOD JOB VICTOR
Pizza police 👮 
Looks like they didn't give credit to the freshman that designed that sign
For some reason, I always imagine that older folks working at universities get treated like shit a lot.  This dude seems genuinely happy, and it's really nice to see people make him feel appreciated.
Now everybody is gonna wanna a painting on the wall. 
Fake, that is obviously a pepperoni pizza in the painting while hes holding up a supreme pizza. 

Good of the college giving him props. He looks so proud 
That is awesome! Yeah Victor!
I want a slice
Aww, so wholesome. :)
Is he well paid?
It's great to feel appreciated. Look at that smile!
Thanked the pizza chef!
His left hand isn't doing the gesture, I feel cheated lol
I glanced and thought the dude was Hickok45
:')
This is so freaking wholesome!
They gave him a pizzeria?
In just an instant ... I'm hungrrayyyy

Pizza time!
Hopefully someone from the college shows him this thread and all the upvotes and positive comments.
My mall had a "Lino's Pizza." He just closed his doors after at least a decade. He made the best pizza in town! 
As someone who worked about 10 years in college dining halls, this is great to see. There are usually a dozen or so kids who appreciate the staff and are friendly, and the rest are ungrateful messy demon assholes. 
Time for a faceswap
Upvotes for this Pizza Man!!
What did he get?
Why are guys, who make pizzas, always wholesome? We had a guy like him back in my uni. Very delightful and his pizzas were delicious. 
Let see here: college and pizza. This dude is probably like 23 years old or something and looks like this because y’all ran him ragged 24/7 making your damn munchies.
What college?
His left hand wasn't raised like in the photo. ARREST THAT MAN! IMPOSTOR!
For all the critics pointing out his left hand doesn't match the sign, why aren't you blasting about the pizza not matching the sign? That's not a pepperoni pizza in his right hand.

Yeah, you hate on the chef but not the pizza. 
Why isn’t his left hand doing the thing 
Shout out to MSU’s 2013-14 Case Hall burger chef.  You never ceased to burn the fuck out of the burgers... Thank you. 
I want pizza specifically from him now. 
Pizza looks better than my entire cafeteria at my college. 
He looks like a thin Chef Boyardee
HEY THATS JBU!!!!! JBU IS ON REDDIT!!!!! JBU IS ON POPULAR!!!!!!! 
Pretty sure that's Ghandi in the portrait
I love this so much!!!! 
aww, this is so nice :)
At $29 a slice, they should be able to afford a painting of the chef. No but seriously I think it was $6 a slice of crap at my school. This guy looks like he gaf about pizza at least.
I go that college.
Awesome! We had a chef at my college who got a lot of love too, he kept introducing new recipes and special meal days to keep things exciting. It was heartbreaking when he retired halfway through my time there. They replaced him with a company called Bon Appetit, and they’re dreadful.
Is he Italian? I am just wondering out of pure curiosity
My university had the worst pizza I’ve ever had. But it was the cheapest thing there so I ate it like an animal. They opened another pizza place on another campus so I took the walk most of the time. 
:| I wish my college had pizza like this. We are lucky to have a damn Chik Fil A. 
Get him a toque, too!
University of Alabama?
That pizza looks /r/pizza approved
Give him a raise :)
*Pizza time intenfises*
Your college has a pizza chef? Wow, times have definitely changed.

would have thought for sure he would prefer some tires instead of mini mural
Sauce! !
Giordano’s Pizza by Midway Airport perhaps?  It’s our all-time favorite for Chicago style deep dish pizza 

Unfortunately there’s nothing even close to that here in the Denver area!
It bothers my OCD that he didn’t put his left hand in the proper position to match the sign. 
Would be funny if this just started his own franchise and grew bigger than the chains. 
His left hand isn't visible, fake.
This isn’t aww at all? It’s sweet and super kind tho 


Is r/Sweet or r/Wholesome a thing? 
Not to be 'that guy' but does the sign look like him in real life, as the photo doesn't?
That pizza looks good though
What a great tribute! Think of all the people he's fed. 
My college pizza tasted awful, still does.
But he's not a cat...I don't get it.
It's like pizza and college go well together... hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Someone get this man a chef's hat!
Pizza time!
My heart feels warm and fuzzy 
Nice Italian bloke! 
Pizza Time!
He’s got a closet full of those shirts I bet. Good stuff!
Justa lika momma used to maka!
He looks like my grandpa .. i love to see him 
That looks like some fine school-pizza right there!
Fuck yeah! Pizza!
Someone get this man a tire!
screw the bus driver 

thank the pizza man
Victor’s Vectors
They got his eyebrows just right 
Pizzatimepizza
Your college has edible food?
What school is this? That pizza looks edible
I think r/kitchenconfidential would appreciate this man.
[Hail To The Victor](https://youtu.be/j0pCiM4kBG4) 
So you're also giving him creddit?
Go Golden Eagles🤘🏼
it's hannibal buress
It’s about time. 
This is awesome! 
Can someone tell me where this is? My name is Victor, so now my life will not be fullfilled until i visit this place.
Heartwarming 
He looks kind of like Geraldo Rivera in the mural.
Who puts tires in pizza???
Great! So they are profiting off his image while he probably still makes minimum wage!
I shall eat a large amount of pizza tonight in his honor!
My late grandpa Victor was also a good chef, I miss his cooking
What's his name?
That's how I gained 50 pounds!
This is the most upvotes I have seen in awhile
Ok but I don’t know why the fact that he doesn’t have any tires matters
That pizza looks crispy af, I dig
That smile.❤️
It's really bothering me that he's not doing the thing with his other hand.
JBU baby!!!
How about a fuckin picture of his raise instead
The pizza place at my university is far more depressing 
Don't know why but this photo made my day.
Love how they just painted Hayek onto the wall
I'll bet he bust hus tail for 20+ years
Really wish my college had better pizza, in the long run it is probably good it was eh but would have really made that $36K of debt a bit more worth it.

Good for this dude, that’s how you go viral in 7 hours.
Godspeed Victor.
Thx Victor!!
While the Elite wait to burn
I feel like his name is Victor or something 
Awww... Bringing up memories of freshman year, feels like forever ago
He looks like the pizza guy from Billions.
This reminds me of Pixar for some reason. 
Hell yeah you go Victor! 
What happened to his tires?
I see the resemblance.
is this a marvel pizza because it looks looks Stan Lee in the background pic
Awesome. Just awesome. 
God bless America.
What a sweetheart! ❤️
Everyone at Texas state knows Ms. Suzie!!
Aww
So does he get royalties on the use of his likeness? ;-) 
It’s 0307 here and that pizza looks incredible. 
They did this for the women who worked the pizza part of a campus diner my freshman year. I worked delivery there and she was such a wonderful women...and I could tell she was tickled pink that they named the section after her. 

Long live Momma Margie's Pizza!
He’s the cutest little old man!! Deserves recognition I bet for a whole life of doing this
About to haul the pie?
I always make sure to hug the pizza guy
Thank the pizza driver
Why is this in r/aww?
Pizza is an art. And it's also round and occasionally square. I personally don't trust square pizza or square cheese. Square foods are highly unpredictable and in some cases they can get pretty aggressive. That's why I always carry my cross bow with me. You ever been jumped by some square shit? I have, but now I have the upper hand, I got a knife too.
And congrats pizza Bob. You have earned it!
Lets get you an attack kitten with your initials embroidered in. You can safely continue making your round delicious Trust worthy pies and not have to worry about square things sneaking up on you while you create. Kittens have a natural inclination to become defensive and aggressive towards sneaky square things,food specifically. High five and good night community of people and humans. 
r/DesignPorn
this is adorable
We need more posts like this
and he gave his hand in the pursuit of pizza...godspeed my friend
I've seen this before but I can't remember where...
Aww, he looks like such a sweet little grandpa. I'm sure he deserves it, and I hope he's very happy.
This is super heartwarming. I bet his kids/grandkids will get a kick out of this. 
Looks like a good dude. 
That pizza looks good.
Fucking beutiful
How the fuck is this aww.
Imagine being at a dead end job for so long that they make a mural for you 
Looks like a good pizza too
This is really amazing.
Post this to r/kitchenconfidential hope I spelt that right
Aw, that's fuckin' awesome.
John Brown University!
Why is he holding a pizza bowl in the mural?
Quite literally doing god's work 
I hope he throws it at your face.
did they spell pizzaria wrong
Even for /r/pics this is a shitty. Wait a second this is /r/aww. Anyone want to explain how the fuck this belongs in this subreddit?
Just by this picture i am betting dude makes an awesome pie. I want pizza now. Wait, i always want pizza
/r/aww is for animals. 
It's a pepperoni pizza in the painting so why wouldn't you make and use a pepperoni pizza for the photo you stupid old man
Well whoever painted it didn't do a very good job.
the pizza drawing doesn’t do the real pne justice
I think our pizza chef wanted to be buried in a pizza box when he passed. 
The signage looks like Walter White - make the pepperoni blue.  
Kudos Mr Victor.
shit that looks like a good pie too
Is it just me or is that Victoria’s Secret font?
Who wants some peecha.
"Chef"
Now give the man some money so he can afford to live :) 
why did he turn white?
That pizza he has looks good
College pizza is some of the best pizza in this world; hands down! 

My fondest memories are of the pies I used to get late at night at the student union building at my uni!
He He hey Guys, Victor45 here. Didn't think I was gonna get my own sign now, did ya? 
In the mural, I can’t tell if he is holding something in his hand, or he is cupping an ample manboob.  (At least he’s not making [the kissing-an-asshole gesture](https://youtu.be/aQ8O17RuOPw).)
Your college has it's own pizza chef??? 
No dog food for Victor, tonight.
No animals? Downvote. This isn’t aww. 
Why does a college have a pizza chef ?
By giving him a picture of Geraldo Rivera holding one of his pizzas. He must be so proud.
Hi
Hi
"Hey, whats this, a pizza?"
I still don't see any tires.
Somebody should get that guy some tires then!
Yeet 
roll tide
u/Houndstooth_tie ... is this one of Alabama's dining halls? 
Can confirm. No tires.
But does he really deserve praise for feeding shit food to students instead of a healthy diet? 
Proof that college kids don't know anything about the real world.

1. The food court doesn't buy signage for companies that have leased space there, even if "they really deserve the credit".
2. He decided to pay for this himself because he had the extra cash and wanted to show off (as people sometimes do when they're successful). 

Honestly, it's not a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for fuck's sake (and oh, those are bought too by the people who want one... costs like $32,000 or something).
How are they giving him credit?
Downvoted because his left hand doesn't match the sign.
ONE pizza chef for an entire college? 
Wrong hat mate. 
Man how fat are you fucks
