Well that took me longer than I would like to admit.
Catisserie...
I REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE KITTENS
I THOUGHT THAT CAT WAS A GIANT CROISSANT
If you drop them will they land feet down or butter down
I actually thought you put kittens in a plastic container for a hot second
‘old on now...something feels off
Hilarious. How do people think of these things?
I'm proud to say that I came to this thread outraged about the poor newborn kittens locked in a tiny box, but read some comments before typing so I could stop myself from foot in mouth
They grow up so fast. Not long ago they were just buns in the oven.

Took me five seconds to figure out those were FUCKING CROISSANTS!  

Take my upvote for making me feel like an idiot and laughing at myself. Well played.
Took me minute I saw the container and was like

They grow so fast!
Poor kittens, they look inbread
They had us in the first half not gunna lie
On closer inspection, these are loafers
damn't now I want bread
this put such a big smile on my face and I was already having a great day
I'm ashamed at how long i was looking at those "kittens"
Why is this so golden -__-
I showed my mom and she said "oh Awwwwwwww... Wait are those croissants? What the fuck?" A beautiful moment
First time I scrolled passed it I didn’t realize but the second time I thought to myself “oh shit those look like croissants” and then I was about to comment that and then I zoomed in and thought “why are they in a plastic tray *looks closer* WITH A LID ON IT??” And then I realized my grave mistake.

Thanks for coming to my Tedtalk
Hilarious
I don’t think croissants are very absorbent.
Gotta cook a little longer
They're cute enough to eat.
Looks like my Mufasa I lost a few months ago. ❤️ Very handsome and adorable "kittens." Lol
I just want to spread butter over them
The big one taste the best.
I zoomed in and all I felt was betrayal...
Le french cat litter
I feel embarrassed that I had to double check
something's not right i can feel it
No joke the litter looks like they’re croissants
At first i was like "wait no they can't breathe" and then I realized croissants don't need oxygen to survive
Okay. You got me. I scrolled past this a few times before I realized those aren’t kittens.
Ms. Poppinfresh better have some answers.
You got me there.

Someone break out the blackberry jam.
Wow, those kneading skills really came in handy.

My fat ass thought that was a box of cats.....
At yeast the cat is willing to rise to the occasion, of being a dad.
I also like fattening up my cat so it with produce more meat
I was counting them and started thinking, wow that's a lot of c...roisants.
Hmm. Croissants.
Dad and his hot cross buns!😅
Showed this to my partner and she goes “awwwwwhhhhh.....ooooohhhh noooooo” the moment the realization set in was hilarious.
Lmao, I was thinking to myself how cute they look almost like little croissants.  Then I zoomed in and realized they in fact are little croissants.
I was like  "omg why are those kittens in a sealedddddd.....oohhhh wow"
All jokes aside those croissants make great bread for sandwiches especially if you got some soup to dip into especially chicken wild rice!  So good!  Cute cat too!
LMAO. really said Awh so sweet and went to zoom in on the kittens I MEAN CROISSANTS 😭😂😂
You shouldn'tve bread him lol
Awww sooo sooo cute and sweet. But if the daddy nuetered we’ll have to change his name to NoNutz! Poor boy😭
Sir this is a bakery
Congratulations sir for your new litter..........WAIT HOlD UP SOMETHING DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT......But what is it????
For a moment I thought the bread was a bunch a kittens
Weirdly enough, i was hping his litter would be a bunch of *croissants*
Me: “aww that’s nice”... *squints* “wait a minute”
Reminds me of these [cats turning into croissants](https://youtu.be/elpAKTauZUw)
We've been tricked, we've been backstabbed and we've been quite possibly, bamboozled.
You tricked me! (And i was starring too long at the ‘litter’ reaffirming my suspicions!)
So blessed 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 lol
I actually thought they were kittens until I zoomed in on what I thought was going to be their faces......
Clever ninja disguised as a croissant.

Nothing here but us baked goods.
Hey those kittens look like they are in a pastry box... oh it is a pastry box... oh those are not kittens
Omg those croissants looked like kittens
They had us in the fist half, not gonna lie.
Nice kittens.
For a minute I was like: did you seriously just put those kittens in a donut case how cruel lol

I love those croissants. I ate a whole box of them over a weekend with no regrets.

Oh my god I didn’t realize till after I clicked on it lmfao

if only the cat knew there was a tray of bread next to it..  it would be going wild right about now.
I hope he talks to his children about the dangers of drugs and alcohol
Wow the image showed up for like .3 seconds then it glitched and dissappeared and i thought to myself "wow op should have made a joke about croissants"

I saw the plastic before realising they weren't actually kittens. Got VERY concerned for a second there, phew.
That's so awww
Fuck, you got me. I'm sitting here wondering for way too long why the kittens are in a plastic box.

Litter to be eaten freely
Baker's dozen.
We have a cat that looks like this and when my son was 5 made up a song about our cat. "You look like bread, you look like bread, you look like bread bread bread." It was so fucking annoying. Then one day I was in the kitchen and there was a plastic grocery store bag on the floor with what appeared to be a loaf of bread inside and I yelled, "who left the bread on the floor!" I go to pick it up and its my cat in the bag. I stood back and said, "well, I guess he does look like bread after all." 

Kid still sings that damn song 7 years later 🤣
Plot twist: the kittens have actually been baked and processed and now the left cat is grieving.
my hungry ass thought those were bread rolls
"Any love for a kitty croissant?"
So cute I wanna put them all inside my mouth
What a stud muffin!
How many children did he baguette?
He brought his litter from Costco?
I want to eat the big one
thought your cat was fried chicken for a sec
Erm, kitty, I think you're a bit confused. Those aren't baby mini-lions, exactly.

Without the label from the bakery, I think it would have taken me a lot longer to catch on.
This is just an overload of cuteness my God
Yep, seems legit
r/forbiddensnacks
Ah, so this is how they camouflage in the wild. They hide among the bakeries....
Those are some nice croissants. Which is uneatable most probably.
That's cute
Was about to say r/forbiddensnacks but I realized this situation is the other way around
Catssoints?
FYI, those Sam's Club Croissants will go bad really fast, eat or freeze them
Awww that's so cue! How old are the kittens?
Monch
Why are the snacks so crunchy and weird, they even taste weird.
cute
I knew what they were immediately because I buy those all the time.  It's amazing to me how close the color is.
Shit, that took a while for me to realize what was going on
Never talk to me or my sons again.
God's little baker
Fucking made me zoom in you twat!

They had us in the first half not gonna lie
Hahaha!

This dad needs to keep a better eye on his children, they're totally baked and he's none the wiser.
Hope he sticks around!
I’m really hungry and I thought this was a big chicken and a bunch of croissants

Edit: oh ok so half that was right
Why is there a big piece of bread next to a dozen kitties?
At first i onlumy saw croissant everywhere but i guess that it s because i am french
Your kitty looks like my kitty. Please give him scritches for me
I was about to come in here and say that male cats usually are not protective of their kittens. Most of the "proud daddy" posts I've seen are actually moms when it comes to cats. But this, this one I'll accept. That's a proud daddy!
First time I've seen a Gold Mod Award.

Very nice.
Awwwwaaiiit...
Why are they in a - oh
I had a hearty guffaw
Why is it a whole dozen? Is that the smallest quantity they sell in US
Took me a second to realize that they were bread babies -3-
A few of my favorite things.
Oh no he turned the cats into food
What well behaved croissants!
Was just about to comment how much they look like bread
YOU MAKE ME SICK!!!
How dare you put his kittens in a box!
Took me 3 seconds to realize that those are just bread rolls
Hol'up a minute
This reminds me of the "Nature is beautiful... Is that a croissant." Tumblr post
Eat one infront of it
But males can't get pregnant
Don't talk to me or my sons ever again
I don’t know what those are, but they are neither cats nor croissants.
my mind goes blank and asking why those kittens inside a plastic container. totally got me.
The Sams club employee in me knew exactly where those sandwich croissants came from
Oh, daddy? If you say so. *pulls down pants*
completely cute carton of croissant kittens
I'm genuinely curious about confused... Are those kittens..
This post is all about the thumbnail.
That’s adorable lol
I swear I just saw something similar. [Did you lose one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/l6gtoj/my_delivery_pizza_uses_a_plain_dough_ball_instead/)

One simple cannot eat a single one of those croissants. Before I knew, I ate the whole box...... I have the same issue with baked lays. 

So, should I go see a doctor or a vet? I dont know how to treat this.
