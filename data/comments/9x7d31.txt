How do you resist that belly while driving? You have a will of steel!
All six hours a day of sunlight we get by now! 

Wisconsin was happy to have your cat 
1:05 was the cutest fucking thing I have ever seen.
He deserves it. He's a long haul kitty
I would be more than happy to pay some monies to watch a live stream of this all the time 
Wow he's really enjoying the ride
This is their Youtube channel:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCprDcGv719ZxGPUKhntNPcA/videos
Headed to Eau Claire?
Seriously dude start a twitch stream and get paid. This shit is like meditation
Does this cat live In your truck? üòé
What a cutie! He is very welcome to come enjoy our cheese and sun whenever he wants!  Thanks for coming to Wisconsin Maverick
Upvote for the That 70s Show reference.
Out of curiosity, what happens when Maverick gets the zoomies?
You literally just passed my small town and therefore house. small world
What kind of contraption is he lying on? My cats would LOVE a hammock in the sun in front of a window!
I 94 Eastbound?
I went into a cheese coma like that when I was working on my night [cheese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxqycijBUn0).
Hello from Madison, and safe travels!
Dude you drove past my house and the place I got married, never thought I would see this as the top post on reddit.
Maverick is a great wingman.
Hello maverick! Wisconsin will miss you dearly! Can confirm cos I live here :) 
I really have enjoyed your posts! I actually told someone about him today and they said they‚Äôd join Reddit because of you!  Lol!
This is amazing. How do people find cats that like being in a car? My cat meows every three seconds and last time panic pooed himself. That was a super fun thirty minutes stuck in traffic. 
Seems kind of dangerous if you got in an accident 
[deleted]
The miaow-twist-fall back asleep manouevre was perfect.
Do you have a youtube channel I can subscribe to of your cat? And my wife says it's a crime to not pet that belly.
Happy Kitty, Sleepy Kitty
I kinda wish I was that cat
Does paranoia about your cat dying make you a better driver? I rarely drive with animals in the car, but I'm always super careful.
Always love seeing your travels. Last time I was in Wisconsin there was just a bit more snow.
Greetings from Wisconsin, we welcome Maverick and hope he enjoys his stay.
Meanwhile, when let one of my cats loose in the car that one time I ended up with 15 Band-Aids and a tore up ceiling and seats due to a cyclone of kitty horror.
My friend has been trying to get my wife and I to get our CDL and drive team. I said my wife won‚Äôt leave our cat behind, he said bring it with you. Maverick looks like he enjoys it.
I wish life is as easy as this cat's.
That dramatic MEWW and flip at 1:05 was perfect
I love how there is 2 minutes of the cat doing this.

I would seriously watch 30 minutes of this. 
Honestly, as far as Midwest drives go the stretches of 90 and 94 in Wisconsin after they split are not the worst. Some pretty good scenery
I was wondering what happened to trucker cat. Used to see a new one almost daily for a good span 
Grew up in Elk Mound. Definitely threw hot dogs off that bridge.... Might have been drinking MGD... Was also in middle school. 
People work really hard on shows like The Good Place . With so much forethought and speculation and writing... This is a cat. And its travels. Happy, bored, impatient. Calm and yet desiring more.  
  
I don't exactly what life it is. But I know life when I see it.
Instagram has shorter videos, and pics. It‚Äôs trucker_cats
[deleted]
You better have had stopped at Norske Nook and gotten a slice of lemon meringue pie, one of their cinnamon rolls, and multiple shakers worth of Pleasoning.

I saw Eau Claire on that sign and have driven that stretch myself many times.  You passed one of their 2.5 locations.

If you missed it, you poor, poor soul.  Learn from your mistakes and stop next time.
Don‚Äôt feed cats cheese.  They ain‚Äôt built for that.
Oh look at that tummy!
These are cute af but I can't help feeling like a loose animal in a moving vehicle is just bad news for everyone.
I want his life 
Hello kitty! Stay warm 
As a Wisconsinite I approve everything about this
Anyone else who can't read "hello wisconsin" without hearing it as it is on that "70's show"? No? Just me? Ok. 
Trucker kitty relaxes paws up! ‚ù§Ô∏èüê±
Looks part Snowshoe-Siamese??
Maverick drinks your milkshake.
Look at that cute cat belly!
This is so relaxing to watch. A high up panoramic view in a truck, cruising on the highway through beautiful countryside, and a kitty basking in the sunlight relaxing and enjoying the ride! 
Please tell me your call sign on the radio is "Goose"
‚ÄúHey! Watch the potholes!‚Äù 

    - Cat, probably
Does he get to run around and have cat zoomies?
Did you know, that Wisconsin makes more cheese than Italy. God do I love Wisconsin.
Keep on truckin, you magnificent kitty
[deleted]
I love when cats spread their toesies. So cuteee. 
A little jealous, this cat have seen more of US than I have.
I live for these.
I love how lazy that cat is!
How I learned to stop worrying and just enjoy the ride.
He's so fucking relaxed
I think it‚Äôs confirmed. Every truckie needs a long haul kitty 
I love this traveling cat!  Send us more videos of his adventures OP!  This is a happy cat.
omg please get an unlimited data plan and Livestream this on Twitch
This wasn't recent. When was the drive?
UUUUUGH why did my genes make me allergic to cats I WANT ONE :(
Welcome to Wisconsin! Feel free to try the cheese, but don't forget our lesser-known favorite, beer! That stretch looks like 94 bound to Milwaukee from Madison if I'm correct, and if that's where your heading - try any brewery tour, they're great (and often come with samples). Check out the new FiServ.Forum, the home of the Milwaukee Bucks & Marquette Golden Eagles! We got so much to offer, so indulge in some beer cheese soup (yes, it exists and is even tastier than you could imagine) and enjoy Wisconsin!
Can I please be that cat. Sleeping during road trips is my favorite part about road trips. 
Nice Rig
I will always upvote this cat.
This makes me miss home üò≠
That's a nice fucking kitty. 
Hello!
Meowerick
Cute!!
I absolutely love when these are posted. Stay safe on the road!!
Sleeping animals... there is nothing more relaxing to watch.  I would fall asleep to a livestream of this so damn quick!
Cats manage to make everything look so comfortable
Do you have a FAQ? So many questions. How often do you change the litter and where do you dump it? How bad does the cab smell sometimes? Do you have a harness for kitty to take him for walks at pit stops?

Just to name a few... I love your cat btw...
Man I'm having a hard time today and this is what I came here looking for. Thanks so much for posting this bit of happiness
Omg that little meow üò≠‚ù§
I want to be a trucker now, looks so serene.
I love videos of maverick!
Seriously, stream this on Twitch. You WILL make money.
THIS IS HOW I NEED TO RETIRE
Is there a stream of this? I would love to watch this at night
Love this cat
Sometimes i want be a cat.
I wanna be that cat
Welcome, Maverick!(and hooman) what brings you to our beautiful state?!
Them beans, tho.
I can‚Äôt not love this no matter how much I watch
An american trucker - legend
how i wish i can have a nap now, meow\~
Thanks for sharing this. Was having a rough day and this warmed my heart n made me smile. 
A traveling cat!
Omg it‚Äôs cute
LOVE
I live right by this! I drive here almost every day! Also super super adorable Maverick! So glad to share our sun and cheese with you. 
Day tummy! I don't care if Maverick would scratch my face so bad I'll be admitted to ER but I would gibmve anything to bury my face on it!
You passed my house in this video!!
What do you do when Maverick gets the zoomies mid-drive? I'm genuinely curious
"I have enjoyed your cheese and now you have nothing left to offer me. Farewell!" 
Being rich and also having a cat. 
And thats the extend of culture and entertainment to take in.
You drive alot, are you an explorer
u/kissdogs
Big. Fat. Kitty.
Skonny here.  You are welcome!   

Serious question - I love truck cats (all cats really) but I always wonder 2 things.

Where do you keep the litter box?

Does he always stay in the cab, or how do you keep him from exploring and disappearing when you are at stops and he gets out?
https://youtu.be/jfsV-wpDpyc

What is Maverick's vlog channel? God damn it, i want to watch more..
That cat looks like it had a little puff of something in Eric Forman's basement!
Kinda wish his name was Melvin instead. 
What breed is this beautiful kitty? Pls someone tell me :(
1:04. 1:32-1:47. You're welcome.
u/mrsfishboy
Thanks for the pro-tip! See I like your model better, I‚Äôd trade of the pay for more time together on the road. Being able to be paid to run and then have down time together is a great work life balance. Great video, thanks! I‚Äôm gonna send it to my friend and he‚Äôs gonna go, ‚Äúsee I‚Äôm tellin‚Äô you, do it!‚Äù üòÜ
My snow shoe loves car rides as well. :) he tends to either curl up in my lap or stand over the steering wheel and watch the roads. I take him everywhere. 
u/seriouscraft
Howd you get him comfortable riding outside a carrier? 
CAT power, baby. Aight hand, ya missed me, cmon back in here..

But be warned, *stage whispers* I ain't got no panties on.
why is the cabin shaking so much when its driving on smooth strait road?
i could watch a live stream of this all day :)
24/7 stream of cat in window?
Good old I-94
What do you use for him to sleep on? Want to take my cat for longer rides and was trying to think of a way for him to hang out like that. 
He loves adventures as well. :)
This needs to be DLC for Euro Truck Simulator!
Y does the cats face look like hitlers?
On the road again
I just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again
Here we go, on the road again
Like a band of Gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turnin' our way
He's a loose cannon.
This cat is living life more than I am. 

Live on you crazy feline. 
The belly is amazing and clearly full of cheese.

We were happy to help.
My best bud just started driving. He brought his cat and it's totally awesome. The cat will even get out of the truck with him and roam around with out a leash. He stays right by his side. They go deep into the woods (my buddy likes to fish and explore nature) and the cat roams around too but always stays within 20 yards or so and comes on command. Coolest thing ever.
Did anyone else say this in the ‚Äúthat‚Äôs 70s show‚Äù voice? 
Does anybody have a link for the little cat bed that kitty is sleeping on?
Where does he shit?
My cat gets so stressed in the car, is there anything that will teach him car is not stressful? He usually starts to huff and puff with his mouth open, and pees himself after being in the car for more than 15 mins. Please help, fellow kind strangers!
That cat has more travel experience than 99% of people
I suddenly got the urge to adopt a cat from the local shelter.
i miss my cat...
Maverick videos always make my day!
Where did you find sunlight in Wisconsin recently?
Where were you driving though that has no snow and is actually sunny? It‚Äôs like 19 degrees right now. 
Maverick I love you
The drive from La Crosse to Eau Claire is by far my favorite trek in Wisconsin 
Welcome (back?) to Wisconsin, Maverick! Please stay a while!
Hopefully you don‚Äôt have to drive through Michigan or he won‚Äôt get a wink of sleep
I love this cat more than anything 
My cat watched this with me. He just looked at me like I have two heads when I asked him if he‚Äôd like to be a ‚Äútruck driver kitty‚Äù. Then went back to purring and looking at my phone. 


This has become a wonderful saga please continue doing these! 
All of these have been the highlight of my day. I love that kitty as if it were my own. So god damned cute! 
94 eastbound just east of Menomonie. Hope you enjoyed the Chippewa Valley!
Welcome to the best state in the union 
I have seen some of these vids and they are cute as hell but something that I am really concerned about is the safety for the animal,
because if you have an accident that kitty of yours will be thrown about if the accident is bad enough.

Just concerned not angry/mad I would hate to see you get out alive of a crash and your cute kitty doesn't that'll leave some scars..
I live here. Woooo
Do you also have an insta or Twitter? I need more of your wonderful cat in my rotation!!
[MFW](https://media0.giphy.com/media/YJ7aHo3FKjqvK/200.gif?cid=3640f6095bbf51b67248756a55f46f3d)
Love the black spot on his nose!
I thought the US would be snowing by now 
Reddit's kitty
I love watching this little dude‚Äôs adventures. Please don‚Äôt stop!
I watched the full 2 mins
TFW no car kitty.
What a fucking life. 
Dang what a life maverick has. 
You were right around where I went to college! And if you're still headed in the same direction, getting close to my hometown :)

Love seeing Maverick's travels, please keep posting! Give your co-pilot a few skritches from me!

Miaow!

How do I get my cat to be this chill while in the car? Going on a trip soon where I'll be needing him to come with me.
This cat is so adorable it hurts kinda.
Just wondering, what are you driving? Do you take him out to go to the bathroom or do you have a litter box in the vehicle (if it was a camper or something similar)?
While this is cute and all a) cheese can make cats very constipated and cause tummy issues b) if you got into an accident or even braked hard (don't know if that is the case with trucks and how abruptly they can even brake) that cat would be flying right through your windshield.

Sorry to be a sourpuss, but I feel like these are very common things people do/let their cats do that have major health or safety risks.
Is this the same cat from several weeks back?! Wow, man. This might be my new favorite post to follow or see on here.  Stay safe and say "Hola" to your kitty for me.
The best 1:47 of my day! Lol!
414!!!
Is this the kitty on YouTube that travels with a trucker?
I'm confused how you're filming the cat in the passenger side of the vehicle...
If there is true happiness I'm looking at it. 
Such an aweaome cat
If the cat is Maverick, does that make you Goose?
I wanted to watch the whole trip lol
Is this a semi truck?
I love this. He made me smile
This cat seems like he knows what is good in life.
It‚Äôs like that movie bolt 
So damn cute 
I wanna pat that tummy
That is living LARGE.
This is very relaxing to watch. I'd be down for a longer video or even a stream. 
I wish my cat was this chill on car rides. 
Yes...I watched the whole thing. How could you not?! I wanted a meow. He delivered. What a life :D
Have you been over Teton Pass in your rig?
I love this little baby.
Adorable kitty! Safe travels to you both!
Hello!
Welcome to my state 
Seems like you have a great traveling companion! Also the background noises in your video make sure a nice sleep/relaxation track
i wish my cat was this chill in the car. every minute of my 18 hr drive to move to a new city was hell for him
Why can‚Äôt i be this cat? travelling around the country just laying on your *ss.
I love Maverick so much 
Wow. Thank you. I needed that. This is as relaxing as watching the Zamboni go round & round & round.
Waht are jor name

Ur welcome ( scrich, scrich, scrich )
HANGIN OUUUUT
I would have to pull over every few minutes to pet and hold Maverick.
I want to be Maverick.
Welcome to Wisconsin! Make sure y'all snag some good cheese and beer while you're here.  :)
I wish my cat was nice....
I can't watch this without a smile on my face.
And here I was thinking my cat is the happiest cat on the face of the planet.  

I'm not wrong though -- it could be a tie.  
Wisconsin loves you Maverick! Come see us again sometime! 
What kind of kitty is Maverick? The coloring looks Siamese but I was under the impression they had a far different temperament!
This is so soothing and adorable at the same time!
Anyone else supposed to be studying for exams?
I'm in Wisconsin. Glad you had some sunlight while you came through. Was a pretty nice day as well!
What's this guy's story again? I've lost the plot.
Give him a belly scratch!
Make sure you get a spotted cow from New Glarus Brewing before you leave! They're only sold in Wisconsin 
WHENS THE LIVE STREAM? I didn't realize i wanted truckerkitty live until now.
Have you been in the shipping tunnels that are underground? 
Must have been a couple of weeks ago.  It's been freezing here all week and last week as well.
My wife is from northern MN and I've driven that stretch so many times. You're in that boring part that's likely to you crazy. 
I thought it was a plane about to take off :(
What a life, can we trade Maverick? 
Our sun (at least this week) *looks* a whole lot better than it *feels*. \*shivers\*
Looks like you just passed Menom, eh?
that hammock has got to be made of velvet from the looks of that sheer relax
He looks so comfy! Stay safe on the roads.
That's a very trusting cat. Mine would be flipping her shit
I want that cat!!
This is so special 
Do animals get sunburned?
Goddamn that looks like a good life!
Glad they enjoyed it, come again whenever you want!
caption reminded me of the psat lmao 
You need a Snoo toy.
I want a 24 hour feed of this
Make a twitch stream of this for extra cash. People would watch that cuz it‚Äôs so damn satisfying and fucking adorable. 
I‚Äôm 100% positive if you live streamed this I would watch more then I‚Äôd like to admit
Bloody cats am i right 
I wish I was Maverick 
I really like to think that maverick knows hes a celebrity 
Can I please have a 24/7 stream video of your cat??
You should send this to good morning America. Seriously. 
That's not even the engine noise, it's him purring! 
Who else read this is Kelso‚Äôs voice from That 70‚Äôs Show? 
I want to be that comfortable in life everyday. 
If only I could be so grossly incandescent
I thought cats couldnt eat cheese?
How old is Maverick? Such a sweet boy. 
Wow, this cat knows how to live!
Totally thought enjoy your cheese was a euphanism for something 
That is the fucking life
HIGHWAAAAAAAY TO THE DANGER ZONE

..nobody?
Do animals know when it's best to get out of the sun?
Such as when they run for the hills in prep for a tsunami.

That may be a drastic comparison but does this cat eventually think "ok, that's enough sun for today."

Are cats pretty good about not wandering off during pit stops? I‚Äôve never thought it would be easy to travel with cats. 
Ahh I always love seeing beautiful Maverick!!! :) lots of hugs and chin rubs! Safe travels! 
Hes like :"are we there yet"
A fluff belly full of cheese in the golden sunlight.
Life is good! 
Hello and farewell from Green Bay!
This video makes it looks like it's not 20 degrees outside, but it is.
Can someone confirm or deny that he has a cat hammock?  On another post someone said there is a second hooman that has a blanket on their lap and trucker kitty sleeps on their lap. This totally looks like a cat hammock to me!!  Please help!!  Driving me nuts!
/u/Calirose65 of all the names, you name the cat "MAVerick"..?
I wish i could be a cat on a car ride. They get to fully relax with a beautiful vista. Don't have to sit up right all uncomfortable. 
Is this the same cat and trucker that has posted a couple times here?
Replayed the meow at least 10
Times 
There needs to be a 24hr live feed of this hammock cat bed, I‚Äôm talking comment feed, I‚Äôm talking donations. I want all of it.
New reddit mascot right there
Did you try anything from RothKase or Hooks?? Some of the better native cheese.
Your cat needs it's own 'slow tv' channel.

Bump your cents per mile by capitalizing on Maverick sleeping.

I don't need any royalty, just a link to the stream.
R/gifsthatendtoosoon
Yup that's how I look after binging on cheese too. 
A modern day Travels With Charley.
Hey, careful der guy, there aint too much left of that stuff before winter.
Those feet! Absolute contentment 
Cute as heck, I‚Äôm getting a kitten soon and I‚Äôm naming him/her maverick. Thanks for the name OP, it‚Äôs a good one.
I know that road. I wish I could say I've driven down it with a cat on my dashboard. I should get a cat. 
Kenworth t680?
Now I'm tired
Please teach me how to make cat platform for transporting happy, sunny purr creature! 
(About to move cross country.. happy floofs an absolute must) 
Adorable! He's so relaxed in his little kitty hammock!
I will ***never not*** get tired of this cat's adventures.
Cat Cab Cat Cam
Well that's neat! I've seen quite a few of your videos before, and you just passed where I live, in Eau Claire!
My ex has one of these that she would pull out and stick against the window on her side while she was driving. She had the cutest white cat that would just chill in there lol.
That's a really happy baby
He most likely thinks he's the most fastest cat in the world. 
You‚Äôve got me lookin in truck passenger windows now. Maybe on your next round in California. 
That loud sound tho that would make be crazy even with my noob ears as a human.
You have some seriously clean windows 
Welcome to wisconsin üòÄ were all glad to have you, make sure you try a brat and have some beer (when you're not driving) 
‚ÄúYour son‚Äù one sun there is one sun
Come back anytime:)
Hitler cat dreaming about juice 
is this 94 near eau claire
What a beautiful beast!
Yes Hello where is the 10hour version of this? Thank you so much 
I live for Maverick updates! Such a cutie 
Hello I said before that I loved these posts but now I love them even more.
Glorious 
Truck cat = upvote for simple folks.
Heyyyy!
Such a cute celebrity 
I watched that entire video. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Honestly, the droning sound and looking at that majestic kitter beller made me want to sleep.   This is awesome! 
Way of the road, bubs.
I love this fucking cat.

What a life. 
How do you deal with bathroom breaks? I'm genuinely curious. Is there a litter box in your cab or do you use a leash at stops? 
Omg!!! Kitty piss jugs??? Way of the road Bubs. Way of the road. 
Omg! How does Mav get cuter everytime I see a new post. He looks like he is plumping up quite nicely too. Love the little meow. Thanks for keeping us all updated on you guys travels.
This is so cool! My step dad was a long haul driver for Bekins doing tradeshows for the longest time and never had a truck kitty. That you can browse and post on Reddit on the road now is amazing. Thank you for sharing! 
Wisconsin welcomes Maverick, and hopes he enjoys his stay.
Hello *from* Wisconsin!
And bonus toe beans at the end 11/10 for the display.  
Say if you have a girlfriend could you ride with her as a truck driver?
I wonder if Maverick goes outside and explores at every new destination ? My cat would probably just run away and get lost 
I never realized how relaxing an 18 wheelers engine is until now
I swear to God, I knew what stretch this was even before the road sign. Congrats on the front page!
For those who took the PSAT: all the cheese!
/r/Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
I wanna start a patreon to get your cat some like geo whats its like gyroscope bed that those cameras use that are attached to a car hood filming the driver on a bumpy drive but it stays perfectly level.  Anybody know?
Are you on the peninsula?
I want this cat's life
I'd like to come back as Maverick in my next life just so I can enjoy these few minutes. Bliss.
It was pretty nice today
We loved having you bud!!! Glad today brought you sunshine!!!
Can I upvote more than once? Maverick is sooo cute!!
Did anyone else read ‚ÄúHello Wisconsin!!‚Äù like in the intro to That 70s Show? 
It's everyone's sun, not just Wisconsin's. I looked it up. 
You heading towards the Dells going that way? (I don't live there but the Dells are fun)
Dat belly
You drove past me! Let me know next time so I can meet the kitty
Hellooooo maverick üòç
What is this sun you speak of? How did you find it in Wisconsin this time of year?
I want another cat so bad... :(. After my dad put down my very first cat (K.C. (kitty cat) after not wanting to take care of him anymore after him being 21, I get this terrifying need for a cat :/.
I'm surprised cats don't get carsick 
Love this! 
TruckerCat: fastest land predator. Capable of speeds of 75mph sustained over 400 Miles. 
I would die for him.
When did Wisconsin have sun? I must have missed it.
As others have said, this is mesmerizing and I would gladly sit and watch it all day
Wish my Maverick loved car rides... it‚Äôs always a win when we make it somewhere and he doesn‚Äôt shit himself!! 
I just love like the adorable pet
Yeah Eau Claire!!
sweet boi
That little meow in the middle!!!üò©üò©üò≠üò≠üòçüòç
Enjoy the sun while you can, we don't get it for long.
Trucker cats always seem so happy!
Oh to be a travelling cat üòç
I need to rub that squishy fluffy tummy.
This is adorable! Where can I buy the bed he‚Äôs on? I don‚Äôt have a car but I my dream is to do a roadtrip across the USA with our two cats. 
That cat has it made.
omg!

I have watch this 30x and has not gotten old yet !! Just what i needed 

&#x200B;

follow me for diy and every day vlogs on youtube @Shawntee Jordan
That cat is my new best friend
Get up on this wisconsin death trip ¬£
doggo!
is it ok to feed cats cheese?  or is this a meme i‚Äôm unaware of
This is me when self driving cars truly break through. 
Wonder if cats get motion sickness?
Hitler cat?
The cheese has infected it. It's melting 
What part of Wisconsin is this that isn't covered in snow?
OP is your name a reference to Kali Roses by chance
Oh no please don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre a Logan Paul fan
What a such trip Bussey cat 
Wqqwqwwqqwqwwwww1qqqwwqqqqw1 WWE awwa22wq qwwa
How is it I can‚Äôt read a book without my mind racing on other things yet I watch Maverick and the entire world goes silent 
now
Okay. I've turned off the notifications but why the hell did I receive this one?
This makes me miss my kitty Courtney! She loved road trips and went all over the place with me and my ex. Courtney would always lay on the back shelf in the car to sun herself and just watch the world go by then help herself to chicken nuggets and burgers when we'd stop to eat and weren't guarding our food.  She passed away in 2013 but I always treasure the road trip memories.
Can cats get motion sickness(carsick)?
Pretty flat part of Wisconsin. Come to La Crosse! We have beautiful bluffs!
And now Maverick is on the....HIIIIIGHWAY TO THE DANGER ZONE!!! but he's sleepy.
 I love this so much!
Dashboard kitty! 
The way she goes! 
They drive with their cats all nimbly bimbly unsecured going down the highway? 

Wild
Cute cute cute!!! 
I bet if all cats knew something like this were possible, they would all dream of it.
Make an IG page and just have videos/pics of Maverick doing Maverick things

And on this day in Maverick's life, not a single fuck was given.
I wish my cat was as chill at this while driving
This is the life
Don't  even think about eating that plastic next!
Man I shoulda had a cat when I was an OTR driver... 
I've only known Maverick for 1 minute and 47 seconds but if anything happened to him I would kill everyone in this thread and then myself.
If re-incarnation exists I'd like to come back as that cat
I love watching you drive your truck with your cat more than life. I could watch this for hours.
SO ADORABLE JESUS CHRIST I LOVE YOUR CAT!!!!!!!!!!! ok but for real tho, your videos make me smile thinking everything's gonna be ok because there is a person driving with a cute kitty somewhere in the world. This inspired me in many ways, take care and enjoy the ride üòª
 thinking that it will be like a scene from final destination... hoping nothing will hit the cat or something


So  cute! That's a happy kitty ‚ù§
I fucking love this cat so much
OMG it‚Äôs a Kitler!
I-94 Eastbound.  Holy shit, I drive this every day home from work.  Small world!!
You know those lofi chill hip hop beat videos on YouTube? I need a live stream of Maverick with that kind of music. 
Bless this cat 
Tomah in tha muthafuckin' house!
Always wonder about the logistics of this. My kitty would be bounding around and would run a mile as soon as door open! 
I think I could watch the MavCam 24/7
I feel so peaceful watching this. 
Maverick‚Äôs belly üíö
That is amusing
I need to rub that belly...
Do you keep a litter box in your truck?
Cute af.
Love trucker cats
So, beautiful, I like this kitty.  
I FUCKING LOVE THESE VIDEOS! 
I love this. On the road with your cat. So cool. 
Precious!!
Enjoy Maverick in the sunlight of an American Dairyland!

Have you visited Madison?
Maverick knows how to enjoy the life at it's fullest!
Omg its hitler cat
no one has addressed this in the comments from what I can tell so someone please for the love of god clarify whether the cat is atop a snake 
Hanging out, down the street
The same old thing we did last week
Hope you enjoy our Scott holes. The roads are terrible. State highways are usually in good condition though.
Toe beans spotted, I repeat, toe beans spotted!!
Haaangin' out
Bruh this cat tho. Every time I see these truck cat updates I love it
He is such a cutie! did you train him or it is just his natural behaivour. I also have a cat, but she gets crazy if I take her to the car. Therefore stays in her carriage box.
I love this!  Traveling cat. Looks so happy and is probably a great companion and copilot for the driver. Great mood and mental benefits of have a pet with you all the time.
Looks like Mav needs to lay off the cheese...
I watched the whole thing twice
This guy is really happy!
I don‚Äôt know why, but I live your posts.  After years of reddit,  yours is the first profile i want to follow!
Hanging out!
Oh my gosh, I remember commenting not too long ago to visit!! HELLO. What kind of cheese did he try?
Lol
So very cute.
/r/catswithjobs!!!
I think I've seen Maverick hit the front page 3 times now lol. Such a cutie.
Best life everrr
I love these videos. Keep them coming!! 
I need some zzzzzz...üò¥üò¥üò¥
Hahaha, I wanna use this for my beat videos on youtube, this is hilarious. great post.
OP's gonna  need a PFD for all the karma he's going to be floating in.
When I moved from SC to Maryland my stinky-boi had to sit on my lap the entire drive.
Men.. This cat have seen more then me.. Can I join rides with you? 
Wisconsins sun is also my sun

Hi Maverick! Love the little sleep "meow!"
I want to touch that belly so baaaaaaad
Cute! Love that view, Maverick 
Hanging out!
It‚Äôs like el gato version of The Dude.
How do I train my cat to do this 
Morning Maverick. Really enjoy watching your travels. You sure do get around. Enjoy and safe travels!!!! 
I want a live stream of your kitty please. 
It's not a Tomah!
Life is good. 
That cat is cooler than the other side of the pillow.
Can someone please make an infinite loop gif for this?  It's so amazing.

If there was a 24 hour live stream of this I would never have to think about doing anything ever again.
Michigander here.

Who knew Wisconsin was so damn flat?
Do they have an Instagram? I want to follow them
When I die, I want to come back as one of your pet cats. 
So do you let the cat out when you get a moment or would he just run away? 
Super cool
We walk him daily 30-60 minutes a few times a day.  
Mein F√ºhrer it‚Äôs time for your hourly treat and belly rub.
That is one comfy cat!
PLEASE APPLY SOME BELLY RUBS DIRECTLY TO MAVERICK‚ÄôS BELLY! THANK YOU! - CONCERNED VIEWER
Instagram trucker_cats
YouTube has longer videos 
The cat is really cute! Yes it will be very good if you can live stream us about the cat! I want to look at the different postures of the cats!! It is enjoying the sun well!
Adorable......Make the most of every moment.  I lost my little girl a few days ago.....so grateful to have so many happy memories of being together and living life in harmony.
That is the clearest I‚Äôve seen I-94
Thanks I'm in love with this cat
God how much i wish wisconsin alwaya looked like this.
Cat tale chronicles

My turn to ride shotgun. 
/u/jeevesandzoya
Friends of the road bubbles
Looks like he enjoyed alittle too much of that chedda cheese
Good morning, Maverick!  I miss roadtripping and the Midwest.
I love your kitty.  Thanks for sharing.
Dash cam and cat cam. Awesome.
I want my cat to enjoy car rides!
He‚Äôs gettin chomky! 
Dont forget to apply sunscreen on its belly
What a nice kitt!
Yay! Love to have a 10/10 kitty in my home state!
I just hope to Dog there is no accident where sweet resting cat is slammed into the window.  Kitty deserves a rocking hammock of love
Love the constant updates.
Please start streaming.
I wish my cat could relax like this in the car but she freaks out and gets car sick üòî. She prefers feets on the ground.
The Road Warrior!
Is the cat named maverick after Logan Paul?
Living The Dream, but 2 songs come to mind, On the Road Again and East Bound and Down
If they make a sudden stop, does the car fly through the window?
Adorable.  And I learn something new every day.  I knew Wisconsin had cheese; didn't know it had sun.
That cat is living its best life for fucking sure. Glad you have a companion on the road that‚Äôs not a total psycho haha ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇüòªüòªüòª
Still dangerous
I love that catüòçüòçüòç
Man. You da real deal MVP! I love these posts!
Don‚Äôt show the insurance company lol 
/u/calirose65 Next time you pass through Milwaukee Madison area, I'll buy ya lunch!
Ahh a nice Midwest interstate. Where  you can drive 30 miles and actually arrive in less than 30 minutes. I am looking at you I-95.
That cat has no idea how good he has it
There is no sun here. Just frost and grey. Escape little kitty, escape!
Wisconson is a myth you're in canada dude
Pro-truckers: how can we tell when we're driving next to a kitty-led driving team?
His little hammock!!!  
Awe!! Im glad!! Hope you're enjoying our state!
Welcome Maverick! 
Yeah man im just messin around hope you have a good drive back home
So, what happens when you make an emergency stop?
That‚Äôs exactly what I look like on my trips through WI too! 
Where in Wisconsin are you right now that doesn‚Äôt have snow?
It‚Äôs the same sun that goes all around the world. 
I literally look forward to these posts! Happy driving
Don't feed your cat cheese
I just worry about that kitty in case of an accident
Please tell me you have an instagram, I'd love to see more of truck kitties.
What Maverick is feeling must be pure bliss :3
Welcome to Wisconsin, Maverick!  So excited to have you and your fam visiting us.  üòä  I love your videos. Safe travels. 
Seems like aul maverick there might enjoy a little time on the treadmill ;)
I love seeing your posts about your travels! 
FTP
I'm just curious what would happen to a kitty lying on the dash if there was an accident?
He sure does enjoy hanging out!
Stop by Baraboo! I hear the high school would LOVE youbaraboor cats little black mustache.
Cat cam. I approve. 
Feel like my cat would be horrified in this situation.
Wait you went from Illinois to Minnesota and then Wisconsin? Why the doubleback?
How does one keep a trucker kitty from running away when u stop? Or does he just hangout?
That's about where my wife is from! :) Happy travels! I'll be there in about 2 days for opening weekend of hunting!
I have never really liked road trips but these kind of videos make me feel a peace with my hate for them. Please keep posting videos of Long haul kitty, they really make my day!
Must be headed east on 94. Use to live around there!
I‚Äôm always glad to see maverick on my stream
Hello back from Wisconsin 
You are my favorite redditor! I love that your kitty travels with you!!! These videos make me day!!!
This is too funny 
This has probably been answered somewhere, but where did you buy your cat hammock thing? Or is this something you fashioned yourself? 
# THE BIG SLEEP
Oh, hey there.
I'm over you
Maverick just takes. 
I'm dying, why is this so wholesome???
You have to go farther east for the best cheese places!  
Look at those little beans
Trucker kitty!
Why are you giving your cat cheese? üòí
Holy crap! The lounging cat was literally 100 of miles away from my house.....
i drive alot for my job and i would definitely drive safer with a kitty
I am only watching this for ten more minutes
Running down a dream. 
Is this a semi? Or is it a road trip?
This guy breaks reddit every time he posts
Where does he poop
This is my dream. To drive around in a caravan with my cates and doggos
Hello from Wausau!
As my dream job is to be a trucker, and also loving cats, this makes me wanna become one even more
About to pass exit 45 near Menomonie WI heading east towards Eau Claire. Where did you get cheese at?
In awe at the size of this lad
Wisconsin says hello back!
I can't help but hum Eastbound and Down during your videos.

Love 'em.

That‚Äôs a Heckin‚Äô Chonker
