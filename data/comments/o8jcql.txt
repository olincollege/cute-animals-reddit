Awww, I have an orange boy who does this, too. Aren't they the sweetest?!
How long were you trapped in this position?
That little nestle into your shoulder. That contented smile. *D’awwwwwww.*
Her name is Nala and she is almost 4 years old. She is very tiny and we love every little stripe on her little ginger face.

That’s real love! I hope you two get to share that wonderful feeling for many years to come.
That’s one of the best feelings I can think of, when your cat holds your finger/hand.
Omg your smile when she grabs your finger! Such a precious moment!
She loves you very much.
This is the cutest god damn shit
Aw she looooves you
That is so sweet. The smile on your face made my day
That’s a keeper.
What a beautiful baby!!!
OMG!  You have a red female!  They are semi-uncommon (due to the sex-linked nature of the red gene) and are little devils!  Treasure your rare little devil.  ❤️😘
I know she made you cry a few happy tears
Aww, you two are so precious!
#proud dad
That’s a good kitty.
That's awesome, my cat also loves to grip his paws onto my fingers.
Awww she loves you!! What a sweet little angel!
My senior kitty used to do this. I miss her..
Our ginger is very loving like that, especially with my husband. Also, did you know female gingers are very rare.
We had a torbie Katarina who would wrap her front paws around my right arm at night and that's how she would fall asleep every night.  She didn't do that with anyone else
My cat does this too, in the morning she jumps on my bed.. Snuggles up and if i dont move/do anything, she bites.. My natural alarm clock.
Your face is adorable. It’s the same face my husband makes when he’s got our smallest son draped over him asleep and he (son) reaches up to grab his (husband’s) beard… just to check he’s still there. It’s adorable.
I love me some /r/shouldercats
I love it when they let you hold their little hand.
Awwww I'm gonna explode she's so cute
This is so wholesome! Thanks for sharing 🧡😻
Beautiful
aww!! thats cute i never saw a cat do that before but your cat is cute and i like the stripes also the color
Love when they do that!
That’s love!
This whole thing is beautiful!! Thank you for sharing ❤️
Proof it's the simple things in life. Your smile is heart warming
This is so sweet. She knows she is loved.
Female orange tabby? That's rare. Well, maybe more "uncommon." She's very pretty.
Someday I’d like to make someone smile the way you smile for your cat 😊
:|

*Finger held*

:)
Mans is literally ash Ketchum
Look at you all melty!
Okay so I have an orange cat that is around a year old and she does the same exact thing every morning while I’m having my coffee. Is this an orange cat thing or something !?!
That smile.  
That damned smile.
And her name is.....?  Good kitty!!
That’s cute my G!!!!🖤
❤️
😌😌😌😌
Holy shit that’s cute 🥺 sweet kitty
I made the same face at the same time you did.  Awwwr.
What i find even more thrilling is yer face of satisfaction. Proud daddy🤗
True love
That's because she loves you and we all know why! Because you are a sweet, loveable Kitty Cat Daddy.
What a beautiful smile you have when she curled her paw around your finger.  Be well!
So much cuteness in one post!!
Awww. You two are so cute together.
I love you, man...
What a cute smile! Love the cat too.
I love watching your heart melt
So precious 💖
Wow! That's love.
Heh heh pull my finger heh heh
Adorable 🥰
Y'all are so cute!
you have a love cat!
Awww you're her purrson now!  ❤
Awwwwwwwwww
Beautiful
That is sweet
Omg what a cutiepatootie 💜
Aww, my car used to do the same thing. We were best buds too.
If you slow down this video you can pinpoint the exact moment this man's heart melts
Absolutely adorable! And so are you!
Aww she loves you <3
This is the exact kind of wholesome content i was looking for today 🥺💖
r/mademesmile
The look on your face when his paw squeezed your finger is priceless! I’m glad you have each other.
Cats are the best ❤
A man and his cat. So cool.
❤️
Your finger? No, this is *my* finger now.
My kitty [Morty](https://i.imgur.com/BOwI4Ia.jpg) was a shouldercat. It’s so special being able to have them with you while you’re working. I hope you have many loving years of shoulder time 😁
I love this and everything about this.
I can literally see your heart melting, that's too adorable lol
Orange tabby’s are amazing!!
That’s priceless
#Aw she loves you!
I normally don’t like cats that much, but I’ll make an exception because she looks very calm
My cat used to sleep on my chest, nose to nose with me.. she would pick at the quick of my thumb with her claws until I massaged her paws.. every night. 😭😭 I miss that cat. 🥰😔
This gave me enough life for today
That smile; you know the one
That's why I love cats. I mean I love dogs too (tho quite a bit more effort to take care of) but cats show affection so much less frequently that when they do, it makes it extra special.
Incredibly adorable :)
:)
That smile when she squeezes you!
Cats love to grab things with their claws, that’s for sure. Doesn’t matter if it’s their scratching post, the window screen, my Danish recliner... my legs. 

Cats are the best collateral damage for your buck.
Dang his smile that breaks shortly after the squeeze is awesome. I instantly like this guy.
Upvote for the wholesome reaction.
You have a fluffy angel! What a lovely companion
This is so precious.
Cats will do things like this and then 10 minutes be the biggest assholes ever and thats why i love them lmao
Thank you for your smile.
Its like the cat is saying "i-its not like i like you or something. B-Baka"
The way she completely softens you up 🥺
You made me cheese so much!
Now pull that finger.
My cat does something similar. She will give me a hug and keep patting my head or hold my hand..
I want what you have!!! 🥺🥰😻
Too sweet for words 😭
Everyone’s a gangster until kitties and pancakes come out
Awww. ❤️
Amazing. 305 awards for a simple cat post.......
You look like Snoop Dogg
Good human.
Aww
Awwwwzers. I <3 your puddy tat! What a sweetie.
Ah the hand that feeds me. Don't ever leave me
sweet cat, dude.
How’s the pain?
Aww cute
What gets me is the little smirk you give when it happens... I love it
I had a shoulder cat. It was the best. In the winter it get in the hood part of the hoodie.
That smirk. Pure joy.
Cats are the best , they choose who they love
I need an animal to show love to ugh, I'm stuck with shitty birds alone af. Cherish that bro.
neat
They always pick one as there human pet
#orangecatgang 😎
Orange cats are truly the best <3
[deleted]
Sheer joy from both of you. Lovely
I was called in early to work yesterday and usually I'd oversleep. But my cat woke me up by doing the reverse of this and holding my fingers.
Sometimes I'm thankful that my cats aren't shoulder cats cause they are heavy lol
I don't know what it is about orange and whites - they're the most loyal of all cats.  Mine acts like a dog.  Stays by the door till I get home.  Follows me around the house.  Even waits outside the bathroom door for me to finish up.  And stays with me every night till he thinks I'm asleep.
cat is cute but not as /r/aww as the smile on OP's face.  Soft eyes!

Great moment to share!
That's so sweet :)
Kitty grips!
I appreciate the serotonin this gave me. 🥰
I think cat's affection is a bit sweeter because it definitely seems like more of a conscious choice. She's adorable and I dig the lighting too
Absolutely adorable, boss!!
Lucky. :3
😭😭😭
I wish I could train my cat to lay in my lap or on my shoulder.
Your lucky my cat has border line personality disorder and I'm pretty sure if I somehow ended up paralyzed on the floor of my apartment she'd give me about 4hrs before she'd eat my eyes
My dog sleeps with me every night and farts a lot
Nothing sexier than a man who loves cats!
Ginger cats are the most loving!
Anyone else thought this was Kendrick for a hot second?
You sure they didnt think they had the video game controller?
Orange cats are the best cats
*B-BAKA!* 😖
She kneads you ❤️
That’s a happy face right there 🥰
Your smile made me smile :)
Beautiful
I love this so much that I wish OP could feel nothing but love forever!
The best part of this is your smile when when she holds your finger.
Snoop Kitty
Nothing better than the love and trust of a cat
She's awesome. What a sweet kitty.
Your vid just made me happy
cute
i love her a lot
Ohhh, der lurvve....  I'm not a "cat person" but this makes me rethink it.  :-)
o great now i want a cat
The look on your face when she squeezed is so wholesome!
You have an orange girl?! That’s rare, usually they’re male! :”) Awhhh
Some say he was never able to move again
That is just the most precious thing i've seen this year.

bless you both <3.
Super sweet.  I love the smile at the end.  It's ridiculous how much joy and happiness these dang animals give us.
My cat and I do that finger holding thing your cat does with your pointer finger. I tell my husband buddy and I are holding hands lol 😂
I feel this. I woke up kind of depressed this morning. Dont know why. I had no reason for it, but my cat. This dude crawls under the blanket, sticks his head out and stretches. Places both of his paws on my hand and leans into me while purring.
I beemed...human beings have never made me smile as big as this cat did. 

Animals are the friends humans need so that we know we still have a heart. The world is not ours it is a shared concept that we are all trying to make it together.
you got a good one there!
Bro, the first time they do that is always so special.
Beautiful!
unrealted but ur kinda cute
Best thing I've seen all day
She’s such a good looking cat!
Is she polydactyl?
sure looks like you love that cat just as much as she loves you. this is adorable.
Your reaction!🥺
🔥
🥰
I love this!! Sweet cat and dad
She loves you.
cute cat op
Oh she looks like my little kitty. What a sweet little nugget
You are blessed 😊
Hello sir i love you bx you look so happy and love that kitten
Awww!
shut up, you're crying!
That's just darn precious. <3
She's still gonna scratch you and draw some love blood b/c cat emotions
I also have an orange girl, apparently they're rare
As someone who just lost their cat a few hours ago….cherish these moments
I made the exact same face you did when she grabbed your finger!
My cat will grab my hand and pull it into her Chin to snuggle it and lay on it.
If I was single, I would think about having a pet. But they stink especially cats
His face!!!!!!! I’m sure this was special. But the fact that this is special is the reason I’m a dog person lol
Just tried to get my cat to hold mine and he ran away
Orange Tabbys are the best
Such a beautiful couple!
Besties
mine scratched me in the face >.<
Awwwww your smile though!  Made me smile….
The way you smile is so sweet. I'm glad you two have each other! :D
💖so precious
I love this so much. Thank you for the sweet video
Cats are hilarious…
That is so precious!!
Cats are the best!
This is my Dad.
she loves you so much
That smile though tells a whole story.  Feels good man.
My cat looked just like her! She also used to trap me. 

I lost her last September. It makes me happy to know there are other Angels out there :)

Awesome...that's incredible!
Wow I just established arm hugs around my wrist watchin netflix together. Never hugged the beans tho :3

Awwwwe

Real life pokemon trainer
So cute. And a female orange?? Rare! Love to see it. Good post 😺
Nice butterflies on the wall, bro.
I love this so much.
Try to download this update for my cat. But she was not having any of it
This is so adorable omg
kitty!!❤️
Take my hand

Off to never never land

Yeah, yeah
gently holds
aww
Everyone's tough until a sleepy kitty grabs their finger.
That face at the end says it all!
awww she loves u so much. My kitteh just runs from me when i try to touch him or give him morning kisses!
She got Disney gloves
That cat loves you so much you can tell. My cat does this too. He also pets (somewhat kneads) my face cuz I pet his face lol
This needs a cuteness warning, but I am so envious. I miss my old cat.
you are the chosen one
All cats are cool, but orange cats are the best.
I have a polydactyl rescue that loves holding on to a finger or my ankle wile giving lot’s of licks. He knows I saved his life. He doesn’t know he saved mine.
Thank you for posting this.  I smiled during an otherwise totally crappy day.  🙃
Literally the cutest thing I've seen all month. 
That lil paw grab. So cute.
Your "aww" reaction made me go "aww" 🥲
My cat isn’t like that but always wants a human where ever he sleeps like literally his owner aka my brother has to be with him. He wakes my brother up to acknowledge him and if he wants he wakes him up again and meows till the room blinds are open! He is a spoiled cat
Lol that's awesome! My cat freaks out everytime I try to touch her arm.
Looks cute but you feel those little knives digging in
Omg, I love her/you! Y'all are a power couple! <3
Awww, friend.
I’m melting
Golly that’s adorable.
Don't forget to xpost to /r/shouldercats
If you moved everything you say will be used against you in a court of law.  0-0
This literally made my day!
Cats are the best and so are the people who love ❤️ them.
You’re a lucky man.
What’s good bruh? What’s her name?
Awwww
I can't get my cat to sit on my lap, and do this punk.... Yadda yadda yadda
Your smirk is the best.
Wow!! So cool. Mine does the same .. Hhaha
Funny how a little cat can turn big men into gooie softies.
This is the cutest thing ever.
So adorable
thas a good fukn kitty
I've never been a cat person however I have one that has grown on me. With the exception of a couple cats that did something really cool and maybe for a only few minutes; they never gained or held my interest.. I have a male Orange tiger who I has the best temperament. Very docile and trusting, I can scoop him up, rough up his fur and CAREFULLY somersault him on the couch, bed, or my favorite chair. When I walk away or change to something else he comes back for more or at least a nice rough petting.
Love it. That cooooool smooth ass ally cat. Keep giving her the good life.
Orange kitty is best kitty.
awwww. "here couch human, please enjoy finger hugs <3 <3 <3"
😍
Cats are the best!
Beautiful. White people would say we look alike. r/shoulcats would love this. I have one too!
An angel on your shoulder awh
I don't mean this in any negative way at all, and in the grand scheme of things, it's irrelevant, but this is pretty cool to me because I can't recall ever meeting a man of his complexion that liked cats. I have no clue why, and of course I know dudes exist that do like them, but my closest friend all throughout school was scared of them. My longtime coworker the past decade calls them midget lions, ^ha and is apprehensive around them. And there are many other examples. So bravo to the guy in this video, for being unique? At least to some extent. Though it's possible that I just need to get out more. The portfolio of people I've met could always use a numerical boost.
Why are orange cats, espwthe males such sweethearts? But to other cats it's.... questionable 🤣.... Anyhow very cute cat sir!
Aww. You look so happy.
Cats... they're so random at times, and impossible to figure out.
When you got a buddy its all ok
Please care for her well she is such a sweet little love!!  💜💜
Yellow tabbies are the best cats. Whether big or small. No other breed has quite the same personality. They're are loving & mischievous. I've had 2 yellow tabbies. Both were males, both are big boys. Harley lived almost 20 yrs
My boy Homer, is 5. Homer likes to push his older brother into the tub when I'm in it. She is adorable & she's holding your finger because she's sleepy & not in the mood for a nose bop.
😻😻😻😻😻
Lol made my day
Finger holds are my faves. Mazel tov!
D'awwww I love this
This MADE my day. I love this so much.
Aww!! I miss my cat named Yuan, he died last April. I still missed him. He is so loveable ,he loves to cuddle always. I have other cats but he was the only one who is very sweet. I always cried when I think of him. My anxiety then triggers again , I thought I already done with it😭
BLDM
Melting
That smile at the end! Instant happiness. Animals are the best. And people who love animals are also the best. Thanks for sharing this! ❤️
You look like you were about to die emotionally. This is so cute!
r/holdingpaws ❤️
“pull my finger” 🙂
You are a very lucky man.  That kitty loves you.
My wife and I we have four cats there are family they all have their separate personality they make our lives a lot happier we used to have an orange and white kitty we had her for 11 years your cat is beautiful thank you for sharing
Dude, that was so cute.
So precious!
You lucky duck!
What a sweetheart!
awwwww das cuteeee
That happy smile at the end 🥺
Shoulder cats are so cool!
Awwwwwwww!!
An orange tabby that’s female, that’s pretty rare. Cool
So sweet!
I fuckin love cats.
Oh my devil, i needed to see something this cute today
My favorite thing is a cat holding my finger like that. Complete acceptance.
That smile like a proud dad.
I'd say her training of you is going quite well
Is it possible to learn this power?
That smirk is the face of all humans when we feel like
Our kittys are showing us love
I love how your heart visibly melts when she holds your finger!!!
🙌Proud Papa🙌
She telling you she trusts you, and she’s with you if you are with her, for the long run. Once a cat gives that, they don’t take it back unless you do them wrong, and if you do them wrong they never give it back.
My man's smile right there is wholesome
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The moment you smiled i also smiled
Oh! Cats
Well that's the cutest goddamn thing I've ever seen
Love it! I’m the middle of the night my cat insists on sleeping on my chest and when he wants to be let out my room he stands on my chest and meows in my face till I wake up, used to scare me a little be long woken up like that but I gotten used to it lol
Awwwwww!!! :) <3
Now that’s real love. All hail ginger cats.
cute
That’s beautiful bro 👍
She is beautiful!!!!
Wholesome AF
Awwww! 😍😍😍
I wish my cat loved the way your cat loves you. I am so jealous.
Beautiful kitty
Cats know who the good ones are.
Awwww. 

Human: "You got me?" Cat: "I got you."
You can see his heart literally melt
💗
I swear you look like a dude I used to buy weed from. tutu?
Super cute, do you got a picture of that poster in the background
Lucky!! So sweet.
Having a pet lowers your blood pressure. You can see why.
Hey everybody ! Watch a grown man melt ! 

That look on your face is priceless 😊
Cat love is a special thing.
Tell me you’re a cool guy without telling me you’re a cool guy. 

Cats are picky as fuck. So much effort to earn their trust.
That’s a special cat hopefully she will have a long life
She is so very adorable how old is she?
PURE JOY
we get excited if cats even pay a little attention to us, even though dogs are clingy all the time
the logic applies to human relationships as well
Question is should you be in a relationship where your partner behaves like a cat ? These moments would definitely be more precious since they are rare but what if rest of the time it's actually toxic ? It's the same with cats yet we are always trying hard
My cat loves to lay on my shoulders, he puts his face right up next to mine so he can rub his cheek on mine, he also weighs about 10 lb, maybe more lol, definitely gives my neck and shoulders a good workout.
Throw her and make her fight mewtwo
I'm going through a tough time so thanks for the first smile of the day.
 Awww that’s adorable. I want a cat like that.
 Awww that’s adorable. I want a cat like that.
 Awww that’s adorable. I want a cat like that.
Awww that’s adorable.
I swear orange cats are the most legit cats.
What an adorable moment!
That smile says a lot :)
Girl kitties are the best.
Shoulder cat is best cat
Man i am having a hard day but this brought a light into this day.
My cat was doing this the night before he died :/ still miss that guy
Precious ☺️
Good cat!
Cute!!

She loves you.
I love her!
Cat (during this video) : I luv U cuz u gave me food

cat (after the video): U fokking donkey where is my salmon
So adorable!!!!
Even the hardest man must smile.
This made me happy. Thank you.
I like the warm-all-over smile you get when she holds your finger.
My orange menace also gets on my shoulder. Doesn’t fall asleep tho.. usually tries to grab something higher, rub his face on my cheek, and then fall while clawing my back
So cute!
omggg so cute i wish i wasn’t allergic to cat
That's true love
I love cats 💕
ha
So freaking cute! Adorable cats and people made my night😸💚😸
Aww your sweet baby loves so much. Affectionate kitties are so amazing. ❤️😍
Nala loves you! 😻
When he smiled I really felt that. Made me smile. Kinda nice.
so yeah...everyone watching just said "aaaawww"
Awwww! She's adorable and so darn sweet.
Omg i dont know whats cuter. The cat or thats smile
You single???
/u/loveless_1994 look at that paw !!
I'm glad you have this Happiness in your life
Aaaaw. I tried putting my girl on my shoulders yesterday. She was not okay with it.
Although she does follow me to the bathroom and screams at me till I'm done.
Aww I love the smile you give when she clutches on to your finger! She’s so adorable.
So adorable
What I love most about these videos are the real emotions that peak though with the pets humans. It's always a straight face at the beginning but then the heart gets touched by cuteness and no-one can fight those emotions lighting up in oneself. That's the aww moment for me. Seeing real expressions that are not for show!
So much love! Adorable
Soo cuuuuuute!
Can we just say how cute when it looked away. Cat saying "just this once."
Cats are the sweetest if you train them well with affection 

Take my fake wholesome award 🥰
That face at the end is that of someone overcome by cuteness.
Lucky human! 🐾
You have been blessed!
I teared up with you when she gripped it buddy
You could really tell how happy he was when she grabbed his finger
This is the SWEETEST thing
r/mensmittenwithkittens
I consider myself lucky if my cat grazes me with her tail. Which only happens at food time
This is the best feeling when your cat is doing like this
Your smile is so freaking wholesome! Also - adorable cat. She’s beautiful
*heart melts*
How precious and adorable!  You are blessed.
AWWWWWWW
Miaw miaw very cute
Sober snoop Dogg? Is that you?
This warms my heart
My ginger boy loves being on shoulders too, best place for rumbly snuggles.
Your username sounded so familiar so I had to stalk your profile. And there it was - the story about you and your grandma! Brought me to tears and touched me very deeply.
She’s not holding it….she’s pulling it. Break wind, for Christ’s sake!
She's a beauty!
Orange cat owner here. She loves you❤ thanks for sharing!
She is so adorable!!!
You’re her human now
Since Reddit is more about popular stuff its level had dropped so low... it is so sad to see the level of most of you.... pfff, so low....
Which one of you is really wrapped around the finger? Oh yeah, cats don’t have fingers.
I made the same face you did, in the video, when I saw it :)

SO SWEET!
It's what cats do when they're comfy. They push out their claw and do that
He give you the hugz.
She even retracted her claws. She's adorable
Too cute!
Kitty love! The best!
Yesss, my cat does that; he's a professional lounger.
Kitty loves her human
That is the most perfect thing. You two have a wonderful bond! Thank you so much for sharing 😊
Sooo sweet!!
Somebody loves her daddy...

My feral kittie we adopted about 3 wks ago, sleeps on my legs or chest and grabs my finger every morning, I consider it my “ Good Morning “! They can really surprise you can’t they??!!
Love that little smile on your face when she grabs your finger.
I have an 18lb Russian Blue that my daughter named when she got him from the Ft Knox shelter, PING PONG!!! He truly was a spunky kitten! Now he just lays around and looks for loving!🥰❤️💜-Bless you my Angel 😇 in Heaven for naming Ping Ping 💜
So Jealous 🥰🥰🥰
Her sweet! Mini-lion love the Daddy!

That’s so sweet 😊
I love that you can appreciate how sweet that is! She has a good daddy… I hope you have a wonderful week!
