r/petthedamndog
I love him
Oh he is beautiful
This reminds me of my old guy who we are taking to the vet tomorrow for sadly his last car ride. Cherish the moments you get with them, while you have them.
Happy elder stateman.
I hope my dog gets to be old like this.
I want to give this little guy the world!! What a sweetie!!
What kind of dog is he? Very beautiful
Reminds me of my old dog, doesn't care about age all he want to do is please master.
Old timer with a young heart.
Handsome

Just want to gently boop the snoot.
That cute little face, it makes me melt!
Sweet old boy ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I love him. He is an old puppy.
Aww what a cute old baby
The face that has seen much. So many skritches requested, so many successful belly rubs. He has perfected the proud pat request. We will all provide the pats and the belly rubs. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
this looks so much like my old dog zeus and my stomach did a whole bunch of flips thinking it was him, miss that sweet boy
I would give him treats whenever he wanted some.  T-T
Each grey hair earns him a belly rub or ear scratches.
It‚Äôs adorable how he sorta shuffled into sitting. My old boy does that. Old joints I guess. He‚Äôs a grand old man.
A dignified gent.
The seniors have their own style!
Theres just something about a sweet beautiful pup with a touch of silver that always makes me smile.  Their love is so pure. It radiates üåü ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Such happy and adoring eyes

Cutie!!
Once a good boy, always a good boy. Good boy!
Sweetiepuss..!
Old dogs are the best boys/girls!  At the same time I wish those sweet grey faces didn‚Äôt mean they were getting old.
Old dogs can not only learn new tricks, but they can also be as cute as a pup.

I have a hard time articulating how amazing dogs are.
Is there a reason why older dogs have white fur around their face?
A beautiful wise soul. Wish dogs lived happily forever
My old girl looks like that. She‚Äôs a cocker so it‚Äôs more like a bumblebee but just as cute.
Please give him a kiss for me
i wish i could hug him
A great old puppet, needs all the pet he can get
At first I thought it was Harambe.
He looks like my baby I just lost yesterday.
Please give him a big squeeze and tons of kisses while you can. Time flies and it's not compassionate. I love your baby's sweet little face <3
Edit: a word
Pet him you heathen.
Looks like he‚Äôs had a long and happy life.
I don't want to see anymore of these videos where the animal isn't pet.
I hate videos where people don't pet the dog
PET THAT DAMN DOG!
Dawww
Dogg
Oh! I love him! ü•∞ü•∞
I want that dog!  Puppers I will pet you...come on home.
Boop his nose please D :<
He‚Äôs so beautiful but makes my heart ache. I just said goodbye to my doggy nephew today. He lived 16 long beautiful and adventurous years. Can‚Äôt wait to see you again someday, Rebel. Auntie loves you so.
What kind of dog is he? I need 8.
We‚Äôll all meet him in heaven one day.
The most boopable snoot I‚Äôve seen in a while!
They look exactly like our late border collie ‚ÄúPepper‚Äù. My mother thought it was him so much so she started tearing up. Thank you for sharing this video.
Love him
Omg I love him
r/ntbdbiwdfta
hello friend
The goodest good boy in all the land

Good Boy!!!

An elder

I would literally die for this dog

Very possibly the Very Most Goodest of all the Goodest Boys
He looks like a proud grandpa üò≠
You beautiful soul, you
Oh babyüòçüòç
Almost stepped on a bug there
Whenever I see an old boi like this I think about how many animals there are in the world that when they start to age, nature inevitably and ruthlessly comes for them.

But dogs like that find a good home, like this one has, know that they'll always have food on the way, and that they can take as much time as they want to sleep in the sun.

And, thinking about it like that makes me happy.
Cutness overloaded
Love him so.
He is loved and lucky. He knows it.
He is my friend and I love him lol we‚Äôve never met and that‚Äôs quite alright.
He wags. He sits. He gets the pets.
this guy's waiting for Fry to get back to the pizzeria
Need to hug.
This definitely made me ‚Äúawwww!‚Äù out loud! üôÇ
Hi buddy!
Who's a good boy? ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

He looks like such a cool old dog. He deserves all the treats and scratches.
Give him anything he wants.
Hi good boy
He looks very polite
Hes a aweetie!
Such a sweet face!!
‚ù§Ô∏è
‚ù§Ô∏è
So I have a great Dane lab puppy. She would crawl under your old boy.
This old guy fills my heart!!!
Good ol Boy!!!!!
Holyshit pet him!
This is giving me feelings
And it feels weird to feel pure happiness for the second time in my life, but also really damn good, now give him all the belly rubs
Can anyone tell me what breed he is exactly?
Why this dog look like it‚Äôs part ferret üò≠
Prefect lil baby
That‚Äôs a good boy indeed :)
Is that poppins?
/u/schnoodledoodledo where are you?
Can confirm it‚Äôs so adorable!
I think this is the cutiest dog I have seen in this sub... his little gray-wise-puppy face <3
Adorable is a understatement this Doggo is much much adorable! Happy lil buddy ;)
If this isn't your fucking dog, I hope you burn in hell.
I'm so glad I came across this, because this dog has the same face as my childhood dog. Brought back memories.
I just want to hug him
Looks a bit too crisp for my tastes
Distinguished Gentleman üòçüòç
I actually started to reach out to pet him!  He is such a fine gentleman.
Very cool!
Walkin slow

Frosty muzzle 

But he still wigglin
I thought it said affordable...
I wanna give him so many pets, and treats.
What a very handsome boy. Old dogs are the best. I miss my old girl (lost her in June to lung cancer at just short of 11 years old). FUCK CANCER.
He sat. Woah...
I don‚Äôt want to live forever. 

I want my dog to live forever. Now that would be amazing
S√≥ beautiful ... mine is 17 and is blind !!
This looks just like my dog but black! Same size, ears, snout, eyes, coat texture, everything!
His tail wag never aged, bless his heart :)
Cutest thing ü•∫
The wisdom is strong with this boi
That looks like an r/Incorgnito to me...!
I love this boi
That is one irresistible dog.
He looks like the tramp from that Disney movie.
I love gray puppers!
Looks like an otter-dog
I know this dog. Sad news about him. He carries the Black Plague. Just dm me and I‚Äôll meet up to take him away to treat him for his Black Plague.
I love him already.
Old school cuteness. Wonderful.
THAT IS A VERY GOOD BOY
It's a straight up tie between my favorite, puppies or old dogs. Can't really pick one over the other, they're both so endearing in their own ways!
I love him
Amazing!!
I want share this.. But i have no friend to share with....
Old boy loves you sooo much.

Adorable. üòä
He's a good boy...
Nice
Good dog.
His face is coated in powdered sugar, that's why he's so sweet.
PRECIOUS
HENLO!!!!!
He poked my heart. ‚ô•Ô∏è

If you ever want to give him up - I'll DM you my #.

This boy deserves to grow old with grace.

What a little shrimp 

I love him so much 
Give him kissies from meeeeeee 
And nice boop to the snoot
Sweetest face ever! Why do dogs have to grow old! My teenagers always ask why they weren‚Äôt created to live as long as us.  Our choc lab just turned 7, and even though he acts like a puppy still - I DREAD the day his energy dies down.
GIVE THAT BUDDY A SNUGGLE.
Aww I love dogs
So cute
Oh please give this good boi all the kisses and scratches.
‚ù§Ô∏èhim
What a good puppy
I would certainly smooch the sweet boy
aww hes so sweet and adorable!

Poppins!
I just wanna pet him, and kiss him, and hug him, and throw his ball forever. I love him.
No idea who this dog is but I absolutely love them
Lots of experience being such a good boi...
SWEET BABY ANGEL
This is cute üíïüíû
I love old dogs. It‚Äôs so sweet how you can tell a dog is old by the coloring on its face. It‚Äôs a badge of honor for being a good boy so long.
You Soo cute
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you doggo for allowing to be filmed. Hope you got pet as a reward.
i always am in awe that no matter how old a good doggo gets, their affection never wanes

absolutely amazing
Oh my God I love old doggos they have so much character in their faces üê∂
Such a precious old boiiii! ü•∫
üò≠üíõ

There‚Äôs wisdom in those eyes.
They look like an axolotl

The goodest boi
I want a sweet old pup just like this when I finally get my house w a yard
Him is a good old pooch!
Cute
Whoa what breed?
Its not fair these posters have some kinda bots that get them more upvotes. Small timers like me will never have that many upvotes. 

Bullshit artist
#cantupvoteenough. Such a good boy!!
Aww that cute lil face needs to be petted and kissed often!‚ù§Ô∏è
Old boys are the best boys!
He just looks so content...
What a good boi!! Omg, I wanna hug him!
What a sweet old boy he is. I love him! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä‚ù§Ô∏è
That dog deserves so many hugs!
Want. To. Cuddle. So. Much.
Thumbs on cheeks. Fingers behind ears. Scritch until one of us dies.
Nice

good dog <3 how old are you?  
we also have old dog here, his sense of hearing is getting worse
I love old dogs. They get gray in the cutest areas.
Omg so cute
Thank God there's no audio. My heart can barely take the cuteness already, if I hear the sweet old pup ask for pets my heart will probably burst.
Wow this is a true cutie
He looks like an otter
Didn't even give him a treat. You're awful
Doggie
Lovely old chap
Old dogs are so funny, and they get smarter as they get older. Its funny though my sister 14 y.o. yorkie poo sees me come up to him and wake him up from a nap, for like 45 seconds he just kinda looks dazed. I call it loading screen. Then he snaps to reality and gets super exited. Itn just takes him about a minute to realise whats going on then gets more excited as he realises its someone he likes there to see him
I adore senior citizens!!! They hold such a special place in my heart. Hold n love that furbaby every second you can.
Give this boy a hug!
10/10
I wish ppl posted the dog breed always.
I love hiiiiiim
‚ù§Ô∏è
Perfection.
I love him and want to pet him so damn much. Old dogs are so lovely.
Cutie xx
PET IT!
I've never wanted to hug a dog more. ;_; he's so pretty i would die for him
Sucha boi
What type of doggo is that? Its seems perfect.
There's a loving heart there even though he's not too spry.
What old boy? All I see is the sweetest baby
He is so sweet! Bet he loves snuggling up on the couch!!
Lovely old doggo, do you happen to know the breed? my 17 and half RIP doggo is nearly identical to yours.
I want him!!!
Hewoooo good boi!!!! I woof you!!! ü•∞
Ohhhh ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Made my day

PS IM DRUNK AND THIS IS MY WISDOM SO UPVOTE THIS COMMENT LMAOOOOOOOO BUT FOR REAL UPVOTE IT
What breed is that? He reminds me so much of my old dog. The coat, the size, the ears, the demeanor. üò¢
I'd have to pass.
My heart just melted ‚ù§Ô∏èüôà
So good
I love pets so much but I've never had such an emotional reaction over seeing a dog. So cute! Literally ended up in tears ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The love on those eyes its palpable! Best to you and your boy <3
Boop!
What a sweetie!
11/10 would watch this video on repeated until the end of time
This dog kinda looks like my grandpa
Such a sweet elderly gentleman.
What‚Äôs funny is that it I can look at this dog and instantly genuinely love him without a doubt and without ever having meeting him. You can say that for most, if not all, dogs that look like this.
What a well-behaved teenager.
Aww he IS adorable!!
Gewd doggo
I‚Äôm getting him some arthritis supplements. And a tummy rub.... and all the ear scritches.
I gave up arrow, then you decided to not pet him, I made it gray again.
Awwwww
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Old good boys are always my favorits thing. So wise, so handsome.
He has so much love in his eyes... this is what all old dogs should be able to be like
I wanna pet this cutie
Handsome too!
Oh my gosh he so cute (=Œ∏œâŒ∏=)
For a second there I thought he was an otter.
Those eyes, his pure soul. ‚ù§Ô∏è
So cute
Pat the god damn dog
Oh god, I love him/her.  Had a dream about my old girl last night and can‚Äôt get her out of my head all day, then saw this. God I miss her!
I‚Äôm crying this is so sweet
what breed is this?
How old?
I love this old boy.
Downvoted for making old boy wait for pets.
It‚Äôs unfair dogs age
he's a bearü§ó
I would die for him
What a polite and sweet old gentleman. I hope he gets treats every single day!

He looks like a seal.
I accidentally pressed the feed button while trying to upvote this little guy. It took me waaaayyyy up to the top, but didn't refresh the feed. I scrolled all the way back through to find him because I didn't catch which sub it was. 

That is how much I thought he deserved my upvote. So worth it.
Awww such a precious old pooch! Pet him already!!
He's awesome!  Can I take him home?
üò≠üíï
Damn.  That's a handsome pup.
He looks like a dude who has had a happy life filled with love.
AWHH. What kind of dog is this?
Boop X 100!
Smoochie face‚ù£Ô∏è
His love for you is clearly in his beautiful eyes
Did anyone notice his ears make him look like he has the "bernie sanders" haircut?
I would carry this cutie everywhere I go.
What a happy guy
Those soft eyes melts my heart.
Sweet boy‚ù§Ô∏è
Yes, he is ADORABLE ü§ó

Something about those aging grey muzzles and the little old man lookü•∞ just melts my heart. How can you NOT love that face?!!?!
Senior dogs are the best <3
I‚Äôm in love...it feels like cheating because my guy is watching me type this.
I don‚Äôt care how old a dog is , when I see one I will always say ‚Äúawwww look at the baby‚Äù.
He's about half the size but his face is nearly identical to our pupper we lost 11 months ago. Booka, his dance is very reminiscent of him. He was 14.
Look at this greying baby. What a sweet old boy.
Wish dogs had unlimited lifeüò≠ü•∫
Yes, the best bio I've seen in months.
What breed is this good doggo?
Everyone loves puppies, but I would rather just lay down with a old dog and watch a movie
Cute and cuddly yet dangerous
