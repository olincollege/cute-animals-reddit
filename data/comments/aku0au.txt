My daughter hated having her arms swaddled. She would pull her hands to her face whenever we would start swaddling her. We eventually stopped trying and now (at six months) she sleeps with her hands behind her head. She always looks like she fell asleep looking up at clouds.
"Ah! After 10,000 years I'm free! It's time to conquer earth!"
I love the face of anticipation 
\o/
Swaddling never worked on my oldest son.  He was a little Harry Houdini and would escape every time. This talent even continued past swaddling agree. One time, in daycare, he fell in the bathroom and needed stitches on his chin. To keep him still, they have him the kiddie equivalent of Valium. Then they wrapped him in what basically amounted to a straightjacket. It might seem cruel, but any movement on his part could ruin the stitches and hurt him more so he needed to be absolutely still. My son got this smile on his face and slowly some fingers appeared out of the straightjacket. Then a hand. Then another set of fingers. Then his second hand. Even hopped up on kiddie drugs, he was still an escape artist.
omg that face...what a gorgeous baby
So cute! This was my favorite thing my daughter did. My husband worked from home so when I went back to work he used to send me videos of that in the morning to brighten my day. 
Me taking my bra off after a long day
Oh look. It's spring loaded 
For thousands of years I lay dormant, WHO HAS DISTURBED MY SLUM- Oh it's you.
Finally, I‚Äôm relevant
üòçüòç Those eyes!
ahhhh, this is the cutest thing of my day!!!
Hey. So uh, that‚Äôs my son. My actual baby boy. This is weird (and also cool?) and I don‚Äôt know what to do with my hands. Also - you can follow him on IG at kpthebaby. You know, if that‚Äôs your thing. 
Can someone explain what a ‚Äòswaddle‚Äô is and why it‚Äôs used? As someone who‚Äôs never had kids this is baffling me. 
The full video, with sound, is way better. The dad plays songs that match her movements. (YMCA, All the Single Ladies etc) 
This lil guy is around 2 or 3 now and he has an Instagram: @kpthebaby
This just made me aw at a baby for the first time ever.
I feel like this may be similar to the thing where you push your arms against the door and then they float upward like Frankenstein

Like the baby is pushing their arms the whole time while swaddled and it could have the same effect 
I can feel that morning stretch face from here. Those are the best stretches. 
I'm a dude and yet I think my ovaries exploded.
As the owner of a 11 month old; I love him to bits but am extremely disappointed my model does not have this feature. 
Adorable.  When my son was that age and we wrapped him up we called him the Love Burrito. :)
I bet it was the saddest day when the baby stopped doing that.
This post is a horrible form of birth control.

Kid is stinkin' adorable.
At one point the baby was literally this emoji: ü•¥
She started smiling as soon as the first side is taken off, then the smile gets huge when the arms pop out lol
My daughter wanted to be swaddled so tightly we used 2 kinds. As soon as she could self-propel, she wanted zero hindrance, and is always the kid who runs away!
I'm so confused by swaddling.
Me when I take my bra off at the end of the day.
Is this a natural reflex for babies?
This is how freeza felt like
Sweet freedom! Love it. 
touchdown!!
The 4th one?  Definite pooping face right there.
"I can finally stretch and comfortably crap my pants!"
my claustrophobia gets triggered when i see a swaddled baby
I watched this clip about 7 times before I realized that it's a GiF
That is the cutest burrito I have ever seen!
Videos like this are HORRIBLE for my desire for kids that's butting heads with the reality that I can't afford even one. This is too damn adorable from beginning to end! 
It‚Äôs so cute how he gets more and more smiley as he gets closer to freedom
This is probably one of the cutest kids ever.
How fucking cute is this shit!? Is there some sort of metric for this sort of cuteness? 
What an adorable burrito.

Heh, my eldest son will never be wrapped like that. His hands resists all attempts to be tied up and were usually kept above the head, so we just give him long sleeves and call it a day
This actually due to the baby trying to move three arms up the entire time swaddled causing them to just swing u when finally free you can try this as an adult as well.  Stand in a doorway and try to lift your arms as hard as you can for a minute then walk forward and you should see your arma raise even though you are not raising them.
Who else loved getting wrapped in your blanket like a burrito?
My mom taught me how to swaddle my daughter. 

As a peds/NICU Nurse I‚Äôm now known as a swaddle master. 

Most of the nurses are young and have no kids, but some just don‚Äôt understand how to do it. 

There‚Äôs definitely an art to it and some babies aren‚Äôt going to be swaddled no matter how hard you try. 

They‚Äôre little Houdini‚Äôs, they get out every time. 
My heart is pretty icy and this just melted it a little. So cute. 
I can never tell if a baby is Asian or not. 
I think I watched this loop 30 times. What a beautiful baby!!
what a little angel!  so adorably cute!

Its better with music!

I about broke my face smiling so hard! I'm a 70+ guy and I can remember our four little ones at that age like it was yesterday! So darn sweet. Thanks for sharing. This little one is about a 25 on a 1-10 scale.
Awww!!!
My partner and I fostered a baby boy for the first 3 months of his life and he did this every morning. Thanks for posting this it made me really happy :)
I love this!
—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∞!
Man that baby is cute as hell man! Congrats in having such a cute kid.
Aaaaand a noicccce stretchhhhhh
It's like a switchblade of cuteness.
So adorable. What kind of swaddle is that?
Definitely cute. 

Maybe it‚Äôs time to start swaddling under-arm instead of over. Our daughter had the same reaction to full-body swaddling so we did the under-arm swaddle coupled with long sleeve shirts and attached fleece mittens. Just something to consider. 
What an expressive baby.
That is awesome!! My son loved being swaddled. My daughter would fight it like Bain in a straight jacket. 
/u/rnegan
You don't know how much this made me smile
Okay crazy idea, has anyone here tried pressing your arms against something (like in a doorway and try to make a T-pose) for like 30 seconds and then just relaxed your arms. If you have, you probably freaked out when your arms started raising themselves (actually try this if you haven't). So what if the baby is just pressing their arms against the blanket and when it's released their arms just fly up naturally. 
That‚Äôs how I feel when I take off my bra at the end of the day
This damn baby ever gonna grow up? She‚Äôs been the same size for so long now
FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS I LAY DORMANT! WHO DARES DISTURB MY- oh hey
Ok....this decides it.... "Honey....."
I'm starting love kids watching this... 
Manseh 
I'm suspicious of any baby with alot of hair.  It's a Boss Baby situation. 
I wonder if this is a result of that effect that makes your arms float up if you apply pressure outward for long enough, like pressing against both sides of a door frame with your arms down and back of hands against the frames.
My newborn hates swaddling..lol it's like she's saying,"I'm out already bitch gimme some room!" I love it!
[with sound ](https://youtu.be/yarZRgMWVmo) 
Heaven helps the man who fights his fear.  Love's the only thing that keeps me here.
I love the look of realization after the first side gets opened up - like, ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs happening!‚Äù
I hate babies but I love this one 
Future NFL referee
praise the sun! 
As a grown man I still like to wrap myself up as tight as possible in my blanket at night before going to sleep. I don‚Äôt what it is but it just makes me feel super comfortable and warm and assists me falling asleep faster, I do however loosen it up before eventually turning on my side and falling asleep. 
My son did this in the morning after being swaddled all night. We called it the "Superbaby stretch" since he'd usually clench his fists like a flying Superman.
Gets better every time it loops
ppl need to stop posting cute shit of babies or ill have one 
Awww love it üíò my daughter used to do the exact same thing, she is now 21 yrs old 
What‚Äôs the point of this wrap?
Can someone explain this to me? I've never had kids why is this baby a burrito
Such a cute baby!

Haha, adorable baby. Her face of anticipation says everything that is to be said. 
A human? Disgusting. Reported.
We don't have swaddling in the UK

In my day the women just used to crochet mittens so the baby didn't scratch itself

Don't know if they still do
So cute!   When we had our 2nd child they said they don't teach to swaddle anymore as it it out dated.  Just to cover with blanket laying on back.  
Holy wow this baby is cute, and I normally don‚Äôt think babies are all that cute so congrats 
My wife and I have integrated this into our morning routine. We don‚Äôt have a baby but if one of us is reluctant to get out of bed, one of us goes, ‚Äúun-swaddle me!‚Äù And the other takes two passes to rip off the blankets and then you gotta put you arms up and go, ‚Äúwaaaa!‚Äù And you feel awake. 
How cute can this baby get!? Adorable!!!!
Cute baby

Am I evil for really wanting to see this gif in reverse?

Edit: Relax with the messages guys, I just wanted to see an adorable baby get wrapped up all comfy, not torture infants for crissakes!
So precious!
Gorgeous child! 
Happy happy 
It took me about a minute to realize this was a loop not a compilation.... 




EDIT: FUCK... its is a looped compilation, I'm going to bed.
I actually don‚Äôt know the reasoning behind swaddling babies. Is it comforting for them? Or does it just stop them from flailing around?
His smile when he knows freedom is seconds away... 
Look at that smile. Definitely pooped today.
Omg my ovaries. 
Ok, this is one of the cutest things I‚Äôve seen on this sub. That baby is adorable. 
Everybody thinks their own kid is cute. 

But this kid... you‚Äôd have to be blind to think he‚Äôs not cuter than your kid.

Such a cutie pie!!!
What an adorable child üòçüòçüòç
Cutess overload!!
Ah I miss this.

My son did the exact same thing.  He would also Houdini his way out a lot too.


This makes me think of difficulty levels of parenting.  I figured caring for an infant would be the hardest part.


But they just eat, sleep, and cant move.  


At almost a year old my day scouring the floor for things he might put in his mouth.  
Then proceeding to chase him when he finds illusive pieces of lint, plastic, wood, dirt 

WHERE THE FUCK DOES THIS EVEN COME FROM  

We keep our place pretty clean so I dont understand

10 bucks says the baby wanted to immediately be swaddled again.

Only have my niece as a point of reference, but still, babies love that shit

Hell, *I* love that shit.

Don‚Äôt mind me, just a grown-ass man over here, Reditting in my Snuggie.
My baby always did this exact thing. Made me wonder although they love the swaddle if they weren‚Äôt secretly going mad. 
This is old. And, It‚Äôs better with sound.
Moral of the story: this baby doesn‚Äôt like to be swaddled. 
Aww man, you missed the best part of this clip! Each day the dad sings a different song and unwraps the baby on a like "everybody's hands go up!" or "hooray!"
I keep seeing Dave Chappell leaving work in Half Baked.

Super cute thx for sharing üíö
This reminds me of that thing where you'd stand in a doorway, and press your arms as hard as you can against the sides of the door frame, and then after a certain amount of time, you'd let your arms go limp, and they'd "naturally rise", from the temporary muscle memory.

That baby is adorable.
"YEAHHHHHHHH!"
Your baby is spring loaded.

Oh my goodness this made me smile. AND THAT HAIR! Congratulations honey
I feel FREEEEEEEEEE
Makes swaddling seem really cruel...
Spring loaded baby.
it was warmer inside .
Yup, had 3 boys all went hands straight up in a mega stretch. The funniest part to me is how they couldn't scratch the top of their heads if their lives depended on it with those tiny little arms 
THIS is the right way to usw swaddle.  Release then when they wake up
TA-DAH! 
That's honestly one of the most adorable things I've seen on Reddit
When the acid kicks in
How I feel when I rip the tucked in sheets off. 
Why this baby end up looking like Mr. Belding?? 
Aww his little stretches
So cute! But also so funny how little kids arms are so disproportionately short, compared to an adult. When I lift my arms over my head, my elbows are nearly where her hands are. 
Weird how two simple folds can keep their arms contained.
I‚Äôm in love‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I thought they were gonna spin the baby like a beyblade then.. :(
Honestly, how good does that stretch gotta feel though? I‚Äôm kinda jealous. 
Same with my daughter. She'd get all squirmy and start kicking her feet when we tried to swaddle her. 
When I unswaddle my son he keeps his arms stuck to his sides. I have to tickle him first before he realises he‚Äôs free 
You, kind stranger, have made my night a million times better. What an adorable baby!

Lol, cute kid!
I don't remember swaddling, attempting to swaddle or being aware of swaddling with my 2.

My kids did this exact same thing just about every time we unwrapped the swaddle.
Anyone know the name of this swaddle?
The fact that she does this multiple times just makes it ten times cuter
That‚Äôs that good morning stretch 
I did this to my son when he slept, I called it the burrito lol. 
So. Damn. Adorable. 
But...how does a white Halo stay so clean????
Poor kid
Why do they swaddle?
Who actually stretched? 
This video also has the dj khalid song "all I do is win" in it. The song matches perfect so every time he says "up" the babies hands go up! (And they stay there) 
Almost like the baby was spring loaded. 
I never even tried swaddling. Mine was a free spirit right from the womb. He flings the blankets off every night and has since he could manage to do it. 
As a claustrophobic adult, swaddling would be like torture.
I remember the first time this was posted, people were giving the OC (not OP) shit for baby swaddling.
It took me three viewings to realize this was different times and not a really short gif.
I keep trying to scroll away only to return right when the arms go up.

Fun fact related to this: stand perpendicular to a wall with your upper arm in contact with the wall. Attempt to lift said arm (push your arm into wall) for about a minute. Step away and your arm will rise up by itself. 
What a little flailing cutie!

I loved making baby burritos with my kids.
Wish I could have a kid... too bad money 
Is that a baby?
The video is reversed. 
Been stuck in the womb so long, you just got to stretch. And although being wrapped up mimics someone holding the baby. Just got to get out and get that strrrretch

When my nephew was this young, he used to do this too. My sister and brother in law laughed every time. It was cute 
Nothing beats that first stretch in the morning.
I don‚Äôt think I can handle this cuteness
He always got ready on the first unwrap. Good boy. 
So cute!!

So fucking cute it makes me wanna cry
Why did you wrap the baby into a tortilla?
Maybe not a great idea to be posting gifs of somebody else's child?
We gave up with outer son as he refused to be swaddled. First time he gave us the WTF face and the 2nd time he thrashed around so much I was scared he was going to hurt himself being so little.

It's called swaddling. It is meant to comfort the child. It is kind of old timey and not done much anymore
Am I the only I've to appreciate the matching outfit to swaddling material?
Wooosh
I love it. 
Why is this making me broody? Is it just me?
I'm debating with my wife if it's a boy or a girl.
Does anyone know where to find this with sound? I remember seeing this with sound and it was even more cute

This baby is adorable!
My lil guy does this too! That swaddle-free stretch is soooo good! 
This is the cutest baby. 13/10
My son did exactlt the same haha
Seeing this, I don‚Äôt know how anyone can hurt a child. You must really hate yourself and humanity to hurt such an innocent loving thing.
What is the purpose of the swaddling? I'm not well-informed on the matter.
Makes me claustrophobic to watch this
 It‚Äôs a baby burrito!
You guys ever watch "Eraserhead?" I think there's something wrong with me now.

I used to leave one little arm out when swaddling my daughter she liked to gently scratch the sheet ?? Cute weird = cuweird ? 
What a cutie!!
Anyone who thinks men can‚Äôt be baby crazy should‚Äôve heard the squeals I just made.
Ive watched this so many times already. I cant get over that cute little face!
My heart. cutest thing ever 
\o/ 
So I've been wondering about swaddling. Why do you guys over in the US do it? It's not a thing over here in Northern Europe at all. Maybe it's just me but I feel like babies will be happier if they can move their limbs as they please.
This took me back to my kids when they were babies. I carefully learn how to wrap...or at that time, make a baby burrito. Gorgeous kid and such a natural reaction. Made my day!
I love burritos
Awwwwwww I miss that tiny baby phase! 
The baby I nanny hates it! She must have her little fist on her cheek like she is thinking about everything, in order to sleep!! Those little hand socks ARE super cute though, so it evens out. 
That is adorable. My son must have slept with his arms above his head in utero. That‚Äôs how he would have them all the time as a baby. Still he will sleep with his arms up a lot. He‚Äôs 8 now. 
I'm free to do what I want any old time  
I said I'm free to do what I want any old time

I say love me, hold me  
Love me, hold me
omg the face she made the 4th time was too fucking cute
Cutest baby ever 
Eraserhead.
Aw my cousin, gives us all Such hope ‚ù§Ô∏è
Soooooo cute!!! Ahhh! I need more babies 
That‚Äôs a fuckin‚Äô happy baby right there.
Fucking adorable
MY OVARIES ARE EXPLODING!! 
This baby seems a little too old to be swaddled. 
Never got this with my daughter, no matter how snugly I swaddled her, the next morning she had somehow got her arms out, every single time
I'm normally not a fan of kids on this sub but that was pretty God damn adorable. 
She should value herself more.
That baby is a bit old to be swaddled up like that. Doesn't look like a new born. 
I felt the need to stretch too.
I love how patient she looks right before the Great Stretch. 
I love how the eyebrows go up after they unwrap the first layer. They know what comes next and they grin slowly starts. So stinking adorable! 
Amazing
10 thouuuuuuuuuuusand years will give you such a crick in the neck!!!
Baby Tadadshi?
You revived my hope in Internet
Why do you swaddle kids?
You can almost feel the stretch - looks sooooo good!
Is this baby Vietnamese? The eyes and nose look like it. It's very cute. 
Wow that‚Äôs a cute baby 
Thanks, i love it
This is adorable
My favorite repost!
I'll take a baby burrito to go, please.

I wish I could get out of my bed burrito with the same amount of glee and vigor. 
Swede here. I have never seen this practice here in Sweden. Why do you do it?

So cute!
Stand in a doorway and push your arms outward into the frame with the backs of your hands.  Hold for about 30 seconds.  Back out and you'll do the same thing as this little one. :D 
Are you fucking kidding me, this was a post like a year ago on reddit or twitter or something and now this guy reposts and gets over 100k upvotes and gold and platinum
He has been freed from his cacoon and is now a beautiful butterfly. 
That‚Äôs it. I want one. 
TEN THOUSAND YEARS WILL GIVE YOU SUCH A CRICK IN THE NECK

Duct tape is not for use on ducts. That‚Äôs what HVAC Tape is for.
that smile before he raised his arms got me every time. so adorable!
I like The look of The baby when its being Un winded 
You would be happy to stretch out after being left wrapped up like a board for 8 hours. Plus for no good reason. Parents should put some thought into bedtime.
Naw I‚Äôm 17 just trying to get a lot of -karma because I can
