This is great. Would love to know the context of how this particular scenario came to be.
Every time one stops and causes a clog in the chain, It makes me laugh and smile
Single file for about 10 seconds. Then it becomes a "is he still back there? I thought I saw a squirrel" file.
I've never seen so many corgis at once and I feel like my life has been incomplete until now
I...I need to know...why are there so many? Is this some kind of Corgi village? Or a holiday ritual? How can I be in that place? With the Corgis?
That's a lot of butt floof
I wonder if corgis are like the Nibblonians in Futurama: the most powerful creatures in the galaxy, but no one takes them seriously because they're too cute.
Only Imperial Corgtroopers are this precise.
Some corgies went rogue

Okay, who‚Äôs hoarding the corgis?

I take a look

Down at the ground

And put my paws

In paws I found!


In single file

I walk behind

The fact the keep looking back is awesome. Herders at heart.
You reckon they know them all by name?
I‚Äôm not really a small dog kinda guy, but if I ever did get one it definitely would be a Corgi

Do they have any health issues related to their small legs or any other genetic abnormalities due to their size? They seem like fairly well shaped dogs, aside from their short legs.

Friend of mine used to have a miniature Doberman pincher, he was a bit high strung and you never could say ‚Äúmouse‚Äù or ‚Äúsquirrel‚Äù without him going nuts for 3 hours searching the house (not kidding on time frame). It was a cool enough of a dog though.

Everything‚Äôs all good on the gravy train till the meet a pack of wolves in single file line preparing to teach the young to hunt.
David Attenborough needs to narrate their march through the snow: 

‚ÄúThese pups are learning the most important life lesson. Survival. Following the pack leader as they March through the snow to the hunting grounds. Marching in a straight line the pups will take turns leading the pack as treading through snow can be tiresome for their short legs. But don‚Äôt let their short stature fool you, these dogs can explode with speed at a moments notice to catch their prey. Their large ears amplify their prey movements through and under the snow.
But are their blaster hits precise?

As a corgi owner, how the crap did they get them to be so quiet?   All mine do is bark at random things.  All.  The.  Time.
So one of the reasons I first fell in love with Corgis is that, in Welsh folklore, they are helpers of the wee folk - they pulled the carts and carriages of fairies and fairies also rode them into battle.  Their short legs made them ideal companions.  Dogs are often portrayed as noble warriors descended from wolves, I love it that corgis were seen as perfect for pulling fairy carts.   I just think that‚Äôs such a charming legend so I‚Äôm going to pretend that this line of corgis is marching to help some small mythical beings.

Never seen a Corgi tail before. They are beautiful tails.
This is the best thing I've seen on reddit so farü•∫ü•∞ü•∞ the amount of cuteness in one video is impeccable!
You've heard of a conga-line, now get ready for a corg-a-line!

They are genius things
Desertion won't be tolerated!
How do they have so many
String Cheese
Doesn‚Äôt single file make them easier to count
I can't get Hell March 2 out of my head
Send this to the Queen
Omg
They don't really hold the line tho do they

I love how four corgis just disappear in the span of 45 seconds. I can see why the owner/caretaker is in the back with those corgis, not in the front with the others.
They‚Äôre like sand people... but In the snow.
Corgi caterpillars keep on going
I wanna ride that corgi train
Love that even the ones in front are turning to make sure human is still following.
THAT CORGI WALKED BACKWARDS?!?!?!

Idk why I'm surprised by this, why shouldn't animals be able to walk backwards?! I think I've just never seen a little corgi do this do smoothly...
No
Nobody expects the Corgi Inquisition!
The corgi centipede.
Why is there so many
Reminds me of school excursions as a kid. Except more organised.

The ones that try to walk backwards to watch the camera person are my favorites
They're good boys Brent.
awhhh
That‚Äôs a lot of corgis. Do you breed them or race dog sleds or something? (And yes, I am aware that dog sleds are usually pulled by huskies.)

Awww
Corgis are smart and vindictive little bumholes. I hold a strong grudge against all of them after my last renter had a serial pooper would would break into my house through the dog door to poop in my living room.
It‚Äôs a.... CORGA LINE!! Do do do do DO SPLOOT, do do do do DO SPLOOT.
So cute. Army song for corgi basic training: those corgis don't know what they've been told, all they is they want their warm home, paws on...one two... Paws off three four...

Winter is coming.
Newfies are the cutest pups tho
If I had a gold to give you would receive
Such strength!
Corgi's have no enemies, their are too cute :D
Move faster! 

The human is catching up to us!!!

I KNOW!!

Disperse! Disperse!
What is the true enemy of the Corgi? That they have to run like that?
Why have I been seeing so many videos of army‚Äôs of dogs in the snow I swear there‚Äôs a new one every week
I want to know what the ones that went off the trail found!
How come some don't have a tail?
Star wars reference?
OMG cuteness overload!!!
I was expecting some sun tzu quotes here
I reckon the ig memers will be taking distributing this delightful content soon

Where‚Äôd they run off too?? I need to know!
If you walk without rhythm, you won‚Äôt attract the worm...
why are there so many corgis in this place at once? are they feral/wild sub species?
Why so many... went from cute to odd...

More like conceal their strength of cuteness!..

I‚Äôll see myself out
Children are fast but the harvester is faster
*The Queen wants to know your location*
What enemy?!
Definitely not because there's a trench in the snow so they won't be buried up to their little (but MIGHTY) legs
That could make a mean collateral
im high as a potato right now and i cant stop picturing some major animal conflict like lord of the dog rings or something and like these corgis are marching off to some battefield for the fate of Middle Canine, like the video looks cute but in actuality some of the corgis aint makin it back from the Fields of Playmore
This is magnificently magical
Where are the other ones going? Don't leave them behind :(
Wait is that why soldiers march in a line in war movies?
I think the real question is how can I find this many corgis in a single location?
Who's the enemy?
We lost 4 comrades, chief.

(Hopefully theyre all following the camera man.)
Well this is adorable lol
I love this
Looks like a Doge train to me!
dassa lotta doggos
DESERTERS!!!!
All these beauty‚Äôs yours?
Are they all yours? And if so, why so many?
Oh, who has so many when I don‚Äôt have ONE yet???
Made my day!

Who is the enemy hahah
A couple of them have full tails! I‚Äôve never seen them not docked
They are practicing to join the army
All in all it's just another corgy in the row.
Ridiculously cute!
This is so funny!
The corgi army traversed the snowy terrain, undaunted by squirrels or their chonkiness. They know their mission is to dominate humanity with their cuteness.

I for one welcome our new corgi overlords!
they really wanna say henlo to someone
a corgi-line
This made me feel so good I had to give you my free award.
Me and the bois did the same thing at buffets.
