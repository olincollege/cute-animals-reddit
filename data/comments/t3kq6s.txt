Crazy how that smile shaved decades off her
Damn. What a long life!
How blessed are you to be 84 and still have your mother in your life? I can only hope for that much time with my mom.
That cane is rad.
That smile at the end
You never stop taking care of your babies.
My grandma had to bury my uncle when she was 97 and he was 77. She was so sad. She says burying a child is the worst pain ever. I guess you never stop seeing them as your baby even when they’re old. She made it to 99 which sucks because she was trying for 100. But really she lead a pretty full life so we celebrated her life more than grieving how sad it was.
It's the little things in life that we cherish.
Just a theoretical family tree here based on rough generational age gaps (based on 107 year old mother and 84 year old daughter)

&#x200B;

Baby is 1 year old

Mother is 20 years older at 21 years old

Grandmother is 20 years older at 41 years old

Great-grandmother is 21 years older at 62 years old

Great-Great-Grandmother is 22 years older at 84 years old

Great-Great-Great Grandmother is 23 years older at 107 years old

&#x200B;

So, 6 generations here seems plausible. Crazy. I know in some countries and often in many cities worldwide, women get pregnant in their teens so it's plausible you could have 7 generations. I've never seen that in the US but maybe there are some families out there with 7 generations.
What an interesting dynamic, for both you and you mom to be really old
![gif](giphy|l3nFjV3Z5myTymK0U)
Moms gonna mom
Where did this happen btw
My wife is 42, her mom is 72. They come from a long line of women living past 95. I look forward to their long lives with me. They get along so well and are pretty much sisters.
84 year old has better teeth than 29 year old me.
Why is there so few comments about grandma's sick ass gold dragon pimp cane?
Loved this
aweeee this is adorable!
Such a simple thing but it made her smile so much
I pray that I can live 80+ years and still have my parents in my life.
Ooh, piece of candy!
Holy crap! If I ever make it to 100 I hope I look as great as she does! 

It’s cute how they definitely resemble each other.
I need that cane
I tell this to my girls all the time. I don't care if they're 8 or 80 or 800. They'll always be my babies. ❤
Happines in her eyes melted my hart
My grandmother is 90, in good health, active, mentally aware, and physically fit for a woman in her 90’s. She’s raised every single one of her grandkids and great grandkids. She’s definitely the matriarch of our family and she still babies my 55 year old mother from time to time lol.
You’ll always be my baby
You're never too old for a Werther's.
Can I have more of that please, I’m fucked up and I need that…
Her smile is so child-like! Proves that at any age, candy from mom is the best treat.
Pocket candy is the best candy.
That is so beautiful!
and the daughter gave a 5 years old smile.
A mom is always a mom no matter how old
No matter how old you are, you're still a baby in your mom's eyes
I am 32 and my mom is gone. Shit like this makes me lose my mind. I would do literally ANYTHING for more time with my mommy. These women are so lucky.
Still making her baby smile.
Awwww so sweet
You never stop being one’s child. Ever
Super jealous

I got to my early 20s before my dad died.  I can’t even imagine making it almost 90 and still having a parent around.  Strap the fuck into life mom, you aren’t allowed to go anywhere lol
So lovely! The daughter's smile when she realizes her mom is giving her a treat. Simply lovely.
I know I’m destined to feel this way about my son when he’s older. I’ve starting working out harder than I ever used to do that I never have to tell him he’s too old to carry. I don’t care if he’s a grown man, he can ride on my shoulders if he wants.
I needed this between videos of the war in Ukraine.
I should be so lucky to get 84 years with my daughters at my side.
What kind of genes do people like this have that can all live to be this old? That's crazy.
Reminded me of the story of my mother's great grandma, whose birth year was estimated to be 1854 by Sarajevo university researchers when someone realized she needed new documents (everything burned in 3-4 wars she survived). Died in 1980. outliving all but one of her 13 children. She was said to be very bright, kind and stubborn woman. (In fact so stubborn that she karened her way up to the marshal Tito to get a promise that he would pay her damages after war for using her house as medical HQ)  What was interesting is that despite being lucid and having flawless memory (except her birth year, but that has to do with muslim culture) until her last year, her character went back to one of a childs. She would often sit and play with children "building their farm" but would get very upset when it was time to put toys back.
I think it’s so cool that after living such long lives the mother and daughter are able to still spend time together and share little moments of joy.  Goes to show your kids never stop being your baby no matter how old they get.
Awwwww!
During all this madness happening in the world right now, seeing such lovely things like this make my heart go warm, and I really need that right now. Thanks for sharing, OP
I wonder if it's  

![gif](giphy|JpehtCvclNLSE)
❤️
Great mom's stay moms forever. My boyfriends mom still checks if he has warm clothes and boots in the winter and if he needs absolutely anything. We're both early 30s and I get the same treatment. That's really lovely because I never had a parent like that.
That’s beautiful. Not many can say that they had their mother with them into their 80s.
Ha! You'll see, at 90 they'll go through a rebellious phase.
This is such a day-maker.

Saved for them bad days.
I miss my mom so much
“You’ll always be my baby”
"In my eyes, you'll always be my little girl..."
Must be surreal to have an old lady as your daughter.  They're both essentially in the same stage of life and that's not something most parents ever get to see.
I love both my grandmas

I lost one already

Im scared to lose the other

My mom is already showing signs of dementia like my late grandma

This vid is really reminding i dont have long
W-what’s this? My soul? I feel…feelings?!
I still get that smile when my mom hands over something sweet too lol. This is so heartwarming
My wife and I have a 20 month old boy.  He is up and walking and running and talking a little bit.  He points at a banana and asks "THIS?" and we say, you want a banana?  ok, here you go and we peel it for him and he takes it and runs away eating.

This is where my wife is like, omg he is so big, its like he isn't our little baby anymore.

This is proof that your child will ALWAYS be your baby, no matter what age they are.
I hope this is me and my mom someday.
man imagine how sweet it is to grow old with your mom
So cute - no matter how old you get you’re still somebody’s baby
Mommy will **ALWAYS** be mommy.
She was just sitting there thinking "my baby need some candy". Love moms.
[deleted]
This is super cool and interesting.
Wish my mom was like this, all I get is candy full of guilt.
CHOCOLATE
This is beautiful.
She looks incredibly mobile and healthy for 107
Their ages change every time this is posted.
From one babushka to another. ❤️
What a beautiful smile!
This is so wholesome
“I remember when they first invented chocolate”
After the past couple of days I don't believe any details the internet gives me.

All I see is one old lady giving another old lady something that made her smile.
Lovely smile
Look at those chompers when she smiles! Good genes there!
Makes me smile every time I see this
Imagine getting so old u see your daughter as a very old lady
“When I was your age… you were 61”
My mom is only 17 years older than me, I can’t wait for this tbh 🥺❤️
They look like sisters :p
Just delightful 😊
![gif](giphy|l3nFjV3Z5myTymK0U)

Sweet video - reminded me of this tho 😂
That was nice of her mother to give her daughter some candy.
My hearth melted
The smile on her face is the best thing I have seen today
Step aside "growing old with your husband"

growing old with your Daughter is here! :P
all of us are little kids, deep down
Damn, tell me the secret to getting this old
It’s the small things, that make all the difference
That’s so sweet 🥰
She's amazing check that smile😂
Doing much better than that 109 year old monk that was on reddit last week!
This is so adorable.
This made my day :3
How old is the candy doe?
That’s so sweet. There’s nothing like a good mama.
Sweethearts ☺️
I can't even imagine seeing my kids that old.
I watched a documentary where some salesmen sold candy to this very same old lady
I thought she was holding a bowl at first glance.  😂🤦🏻‍♀️
I deeply hope that this will be my mom and me. I lost my dad when I was a teenager and it really wrecked me. I can’t imagine losing my mom.
r/contagioussmile
Always momma's baby girl!
Gram gram got the sort of cane like the old wise matriarch that could have absolutely kicked your ass when she was 40 years younger
Bless these gentle souls
Now I’m not one to get emotional over things but I felt like almost crying when I saw this...
My mom passed when she was 56 and i 25, this is something i dream of at night. I am happy others can live long happy lives together
🥺
Do they have strawberry hard candies where they are?
This is the sweetest picture of 
mother and daughter loving each
other,could there be anything better?
When she smiled she de-aged 20 years.
This was beatiful 

 Thanks OP
God bless old women.
chocolate!? WAT?! what are they selling!?
It's LSD they party
How old was candy?
My mum is 82. She still flings her arm out to save me when she thinks an accident is imminent
That is so incredibly sweet- made my day.💕
Every time i see people with long lives they are all women. I wonder why.
Still her little girl
This would be so surreal to me, to be what many would call elderly, but still have your parent around. I’m not complaining, it is just not a luxury you hear of often.
This is a pretty old video. It always makes me smile, though.
This has been reposted for 107 years now.

Please, God, don’t let me live to be 107…

Great grandma: "I'm going to go lay down for the last time now. Here's your inheritance, have fun."
Living that long in our current state would just be terrible. You can hardly move, see, wash yourself, etc.

No sir, I don't like it.
I mean this in a positive way, they remind me of two orangutans sitting around, and one hands the other something and the other gets happy. :)
Wow this is the great post. Parents is second God
Stop fucking reposting this!
Why do people post things that isn’t their content, is old af and has already circulated the internet a million times, then other people spend actual money to give awards for something that is just copied from the millions of other times it’s circulated. I do not understand Reddit at all. Or ppl.
This warms my heart
Lovely
How are you
Awww, my goodness, this is absolutely adorable!! ☺️
That hit me in all the feels
We should all be so lucky in our lives. 🥰❤️😍
I feel sorry for everybody who did not or was not able to get this kind of unconditional love and caring only a mother and grandmother can give.
It's warmth you will always carry with you in your heart.
How old is that candy?
Aww that warms my heart! 
That would never happen in America, our amazing healthcare system is designed to keep the ultra wealthy alive, no one else. 
“I can either afford my insulin or have enough money to pay my electric bill…not both”
What a smile!!
You never stop taking care of your babies.
Thank you for sharing this. It out a smile on my face for the first time today.
I remember when they first invented candy.
I wish my mom didn't hate me because I'm a guy.
I work in a retirement home. This makes my heart sing. <3
Family is forever
This is definitely top 10 most wholesome moments I have ever seen! BEAUTIFUL!!
Look at that smile.
These kids today
❤️
Precious energy
They will definitely win 7th generation challenge!
Almost how you pass candy around at a party in the bathroom lol!
she had her when she was 23 in case you were gonna do the math you're welcome
Nose candy, no wonder she smiled!
classic mom and her kids
She ain't never getting that inheritance lol
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
🥺
That smile!!!
Mom's are AWESOME!
Mother doesnt look a day over 90
I hope I can still give my babies candy when they’re in their 80s 😭😭😭
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
She loves her baby girl.
Her cane is kinda fire though.
Money can’t buy that… I miss my mom so much. Love you always mom. 

I hope you found the rest, that so seemed to elude you in life.
God i wish we All can life like this 2 Ma'ams 🙏🤝
Insane how much joy an edible can bring to any age
Never too old for candy from mom.
That smile!
Not everybody has the character of this mother
So lucky
May we all live to see and experience life as many years as possible! Wishing everyone a long prosperous, purposeful, rewarding and healthful life!
That's her baby <3 for ever.
Genuine aww Genuine smile
Immediately reminded me of [this cutie comic.](https://i.imgur.com/OcRKK.jpeg)
I love how my dyslexic self thought she just handed her daughter 84 year old candy
The sweetest thing about this wasn't the candy. It was that smile.
I needed this ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
To some of us the very thought of our mother being alive and in our lives that long is extremely frightening. I am one of those people. Please no.
![gif](giphy|dWH9z44C5m0wa0CAmB)
Aww so sweet.
Didn’t know i was going to cry that hard!
Freaking beautiful look at family/humanity! Got me feeling optimistic about our future
Still her baby
Thanking her for cleaning her room
Mommies gonna mommy.
I love that they both get to experience their elderly age together. Wholesome.
I don’t care how often this is posted. I freaking love it. I could watch it over and over.
Awwwwwww
I’m not crying 😭 you are crying 😭
Moms gotta mom.
Didn't even read the name of this sub and did exactly that.
Only thing older than the mother is this video.
But her cane tho… 🐉
She has to be one of the luckiest people in the world to still have her Mom with her at 84
[removed]
May the GOD protect you
So Beautiful! 🥺😍🙏
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
I love this!!!!!
That's a dope pipe
You a ray of sunshine in the darkness :)
Here goes my free award
I feel as if they meant to say daughter not granddaughter. I’m trying to do the math that means that the granddaughter is only 23 years younger than the grandmother. When did the mother give birth to the granddaughter. The timeline doesn’t add up.
I love everything about this.
The *joy* in her face :)))
Awe , they are both so cute , but that smile is everything!
I bet that daughter hears “this must be your sister ;)” all the time.
honestly that woman is so lucky she got to have her mom be apart of her life for that long. I never imagined how beautiful an elderly mother and daughter would be, but it brings me to tears.
Crazy to think the mother was alive for world war I & II
The really endearing thing about this is living to 84 and STILL having your mum around to treat you like a kid. I think that's kinda beautiful.
23 years apart. How different the world must seem to them.
why she look like she wants to read my fingers
Does this count as an award 😊
The daughter's smile is so heartwarming
I'm not crying.  
I have hobbies, I work out.
Thinking of the age gap, she outlived being her child by far more years..

I mean, 84, deduct the childhood age (12 years) and teenage (7) Total = 19 years,

84 - 19 = 65 years...
in the end everyone still momma's boy or girl :)
Life goals.
That made me smile so hard
That smile! Absolutely made my day.
I now shed a single tear of hope for humanity
Could watch that smile all day!
Adorable.
[removed]
Thanks mom!
That smile... brings me joy.
This made my whole month.
r/mademesmile
She still hasn't left home?
WHAT ARE THEY SELLING?
Nice set of chompers on that 84 yo
Oh my goodness, how absolutely beautiful xx
That’s beautiful
The daughter’s smile is so sweet! 😭
beautiful, awesome video.
So sweet!
Those are some nice teeth for an 84 year old. They don’t have that denture look either.
And what is your solution for overpopulation?
Nice repost karma farm op
[deleted]
that smile
Things like this make me sad that I’m waiting till my 30s to have kids :(
Now we just need to see the daughter give the granddaughter candy and then her daughter
Consider the cockles of my heart warmed.
I'm not crying, you're crying. Damnit my eyes hurt, I needed this, so sweet.
Bro she got better teeth than i do and I'm 29 wtf
The mother is mother
I’ve had a very rough day and probably watched this 4 times already and now I feel better
It must be wild to look at your own child and see someone old enough to need a wheelchair.
Just the thought of being able to spend that long with my daughter makes me happy.
This is so sweet in more ways than one.
That melted my cold heart
That's really precious.
I wanna know her dental hygiene habits
everytime this comes up, it  will cheer me up. its one of the most wholesome and precious things that this world can offer us
They're selling chocolate
Imagine your daughter dies of old age before you.
It be like that
You sure they’re mother and daughter? They look like sisters.
"ooo, piece o' candy"
Well that’s a contagious smile…
Aww look at that smile
Those numbers don't really add up.
You are never not your parents baby no matter how old we all get.
I just said, "Aww!" Out loud and then I realized which group this was from 😛
I can’t even begin to imagine how old and sticky that candy is
This is the best, nothing like having a treat from Mum
Once you become a parent, you remain a parent until the day you die ❤
and this is prob why i dont really wanna live past 70 years. 

currently 22 :)
Wow, the daughter is beautiful.
Damn, she maxed out on aging already, she looks like 5 years older than her daughter.
Grow old along with me.  The last of life, for which the first was made... I can't remember the rest.
I don't believe the title but this is still cute.
This will be the Queen and Prince Charles, except he’ll look even more sour at her reluctance to die.
Who here watching this as a grown ass adult, still afraid of mommas ass whoopin
What the fuck are y’all eating?
Bruh that cane!
I want to have a cane like hers. It’s so cool.
WHAT ARE THEY SELLIN??
I love them
Because she finally cleaned her room
Awwwww this is adorable 🥰
Grannies stay slipping the goods 😂😂
Old ladies always put the candy right into that perfect spot just atop your forearm
"I remember when they invented chocolate. I always hated it."
cute
So wholesome
Right on.
Nobody is going to summon the magical video bot so I can show this to my class?

Okay. Can someone tell me how to do it?
Luckily for me, my nostrils are my most expressive feature.
Friggen heartwarming
Candy? Girl just got some PACKET
That’s fucking adorable
Love this !
I'm going to be eating candy for as old as I manage to live.
And the perfect ending would have been her passing the empty wrapper back.

Some longevity in their genes for sure!
That smile is utterly beautiful...I cannot imagine being so old and having a child in their eighties, amazing.
Why is this so f’in cute?
Can I repost this next?
Love the surprised, genuine smile!
Im smile when watch this clip.
Candy is dandy
Great smile.
Looks like sisters.
This made my month so much happier 😀😀
notice how fast and strong the 107 year old is at pushing down her coat after removing the candy
❤️
Some things never change! I loved this video
Bad for your health!
Love this… btw… their skin is gorgeous…
This was so cute!
r/blessed
"here's your damned inheritance you keep waiting for."
I wonder if at 84, she still refers to her as *Grandma*, or maybe her name, or a combination of the two that just stuck over the years; and vice versa, of course.
I love this!!
Awesome!!!
That’s a great smile
Wow. That’s a long life.
Should say "sneaks" her 85 year old daughter candy 🥰
That smile 😍
“I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate.”
What a great smile!!
Beautiful
Damn that’s wholesome
Nostalgia in 80 years
Now we just need the 84 year old to give her daughter a candy and so on and so forth
Awe momma
Mashalla. Longlife for both
Is it me or was the way she closed her pocket insanely swift..
The daughter is diabetic. So good going mom
You never stop being a mother.
The sweetest smile ever!
Doesn't matter how old your kids are, they're still your kids.
What do they put in there tea.
omg, she looks lie a little girl with that smile... her eye are lighting up, really beautiful!
Gorgeous.
That smile never gets old!
You’re always a Chile to your parents. And what’s going on in the background? Are they in a war zone?
The smile :)
So precious
Chocolate? Did you say, chocolate?
Thanks! Needed that smile.
My kids are 6, 2 and 8 months...the thought that I might still be hanging out with them at this age makes me so happy rn
Time to repost this already? Cool.
Words cannot describe how happy that made me
Sometimes I think about now matter how old, to some parents, one will always be their baby.
Pass it on to her 60 year old daughter, then the 40 year old, 20, and baby?

Seriously 6 generations possible there.
Once a Mama,
 Always a Mama.
I fucking needed this so badly today, thank you.
Cuteeee
So that's the secret to long life!
Oh that's cute!
That is incredible!!!!
Enjoy small things in life ✌️😇

This makes me feel.
Omg look at her beautiful smile!
I'll bet it's chocolate.

I'll bet she remembers when they first invented chocolate
Beautiful moment💕💞

Rewatching this 36500 times, just cant stop smiling
That is why  really like old people. they are sweet kind, and have the cutest moments together. This was truly adorable. ❤😍
Oh. I was hoping it was an actual relic given to her as a 100th year birthday present or something. But still cool.
MADE MY DAY!!

I hope me and my mom can live to be like this.
Dude her smile was wished from the heavens

This is so beautiful! Thanks for sharing.

OMG her teeth are amazing.
This is so cute
Seen this on seversl pages and their age differs on every upload xD
The simple things :)
That’s so sweet.
Made me smile.♥️
Plot twist: theyre 58 and 37, just retired professional smoking and sun tanning models.
That’s got to be a wild sensation.

Aw
Proof no matter how old, they will always be your baby lol
I dont realy like when people are on this sub. But this. This id beautiful
I miss my mammer jammer.
That will be me with my girls🥰
Anyone else looking at her epic dragon cane? Pretty sure she has magical powers…and candy.
Mums always stay mums ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Wow,  check out the dragon cane!
so cool
She’s probably giving her biscuits from the santa maria bruh 💀💀
This reminds me of my 94 year old grandmother who constantly treats (my uncle) her eldest son, 72, as her baby at any age.
I remember when they invented chocolate!
I love the way her smile lights up her whole face.  Great!
She looks younger partly because of the fake teeth.
Her grin at the end 🥰
