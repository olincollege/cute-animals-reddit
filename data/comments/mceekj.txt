Even after Kitty's eyes are below the edge of the window, he continues slow and steady until he's completely gone. Love it!

it looks more like the human was creeping on the cat

"I'm watching you Wazowski. Alwaysss watchingggggg".
Fun Fact: when cats slow blink at you it's communicating affection !
My gosh that's just hysterical.
I want this to be the next big gif/meme
This looks like this kitty that used to spy on me.  I lived on the lower level and when I cooked or smoke weed, I would leave the window open.  I caught it looking at me so many times (especially when I was cooking).
My cat does this when we catch him sitting on the dining room chair peering over the edge of the table to try and see what we’re eating.

lol.  Cats.

That hair!
I'm watching you wasowski, alwaysss watching
This cat has killed many people
*YO YO*

_you didnt see anything_
Why does it have a human nose
Cameraman maybe had his eyes hidden to the cat. Cat takes opportunity to duck slowly as he watches for the guys eyes.
That’s an ex lovers ghost inside a cat if I’ve ever seen one
Why do I feel like there's someone holding the cat?
"I'm not even here, I'm hallucination"
Is it just me, or does it look like someone is on the other side holding the cat and slowly lowering it? It kinda has that shake/twitch you get when you hold your arms up or out for too long, especially holing something with weight.
i think its being held up by someone
set this to the tune of “private eyes”
This has meme written all over it
Cat: “you didn’t see anything”
How do you even capture a moment like this

He went to sleep. Like all cats do.
Wtf those are the most human eyes I’ve seen on a cat
This cat was gazing at you with love and affection, you can tell from the eyes. This cat was a manifestation of your very soul.
You're videoing into someone's house.  
  
The *Kitteh* is the creeper?
This is kind of like that Homer Simpson meme where he backs up into the bushes

If he moves slowly you can't see him. Also, you're a T-rex.
That cat looks high AF
Total Spongebob move. Just needs a slide-whistle sound effect when he goes down.

Lmao slowly hide no one will notice 😂
