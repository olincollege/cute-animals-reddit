I don't know if i would awwing or freaking the fuck out if i saw this
The gif and the thread title also work if you assume they are at a grocery store for dogs and that's his service human. 
this leads me to believe you can train a dog to do anything
"We're going straight to the aisle with the dog biscuits Jon, you know that don't you" 
What a good boy, Sherperding your cart 
"Dude, I should not have eaten that entire edible before coming in here. That lady looked *EXACTLY* like a German Shepherd."
German Shepards are the best 
"You are even better than a kid"
*Not a dog, no sir! I'm just your average shopper who enjoys good prices. Please ignore me and have a good day.*

Getting dog food for the pups.
is that a short leash tied to that cart grip ?
How does that dog have hands?
Dogs don't belong in grocery stores.
Well this is German quality!
aww he thinks he's people
All I see is the acceleration of probable hip problems. But if that gets this guy a "hey everybody look how cool my dog is, you must think Im so interesting" ..... pffff well worth the hip problems /s

Edit: inevitable to probable
I think it's nasty as hell to bring an animal into a place that sells or serves food...
U should submit this to /childfree 

and say dogs are better at shopping than children.
Cute dog and I'll probably go to Reddit Hell for this, but I have some observations and a question:

1.  Observation: Clearly this is not a seeing eye dog, not even in training.  I don't believe that pushing a shopping cart is part of that training.  Plus, it would be wearing an "In Training" vest and probably a harness.  If it were a working seeing eye dog there might be some outward indication that the human is blind, the dog would definitely have a harness on, and would be on all fours guiding his human.

2.  Observation:  It doesn't appear that this would be a service dog, which would be on a leash and wearing some sort of "Service Animal" vest or other indication of its status.

3.  Observation:  The store looks like a grocery store.  For humans.  Not Pet Smart or other dedicated pet supply store.

4.  Question:  Assuming my observations are correct, why is the owner bringing the dog into a store when the animal, as good a boy/girl as it might possibly be, is probably not allowed by law (at least in California)?
Animals in the food section of a store, WTF
It's weird. I have no problem seeing dogs on leashes. I have no problem seeing dogs doing stuff on standing up on their hind legs.  But combining the two makes me uncomfortable, like it's a slave.
Dog trainer and GSD exhibitor/fancier/breeder here. A few things of note:

-If this is in the US, this is illegal per federal health code and ADA guidelines for service dog behavior. 

-This is not difficult to teach. A dog with basic obedience can learn this trick in 3-10 days.

-There is no scientific evidence this leads to hip dysplasia. 19% of GSD radiographs submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals are rated dysplastic. That's 39th after 37 other dog breeds and Maine Coon cats. HD has a genetic component, as well as being heavily influenced by pediatric spay/neuter (see UC Davis study on this), and obesity. 

The more you know! 
If you bring a dog into a grocery store you are an inconsiderate asshole.  That's where people buy food this is completely unhygienic.
Detective Hoffman on his day off!
Wonderful dedicated helper.
That doesn't look like a service dog which makes that owner one of those "assholes that brings their dog into a grocery store". There's no reason to bring your pet into a store unless your blind or handicapped and actually need to have your dog with you.
Making a dog walk like that is guaranteed to lead to hip dysphasia later in life, particularly with German Sheperds.

Fuck this guy.
There's like one thing in the cart. That dogs just showing off, he should be carrying a basket 
I thought to myself, today while in the grocery store, "I sure could use a seeing eye dog, what with how quickly my eyesight is degenerating." Then, I realized how useless that would be as a dog doesn't know what celery is or how to read nutrition labels :(
"Oh shit guys, the dog ate all the edibles... AGAIN"
Not that I want to put a damper on it by playing Devils Advocate but; the lead looks shorts ie the dog has to walk like that or it will be tight round the neck. Is it akin to a 'circus trick'.
Where are my testicles, Summer?
Non-People of Walmart?
German Shoperd
Dog: Keith, we are running low on treats, we should get them while were here.
I used to deliver groceries to peoples homes and one house had a dog that would help by grabbing the bags and pulling them to the fridge. 
Anyone notice how short the leash attached to the cart is? Or is it an illusion.
Edit: changed shirt to short 
German Shophard
I feel like doing that trick for too long is painful for the dog üôÅ
Customer service dog. 
Is that... legal?

Is there a school to send kids to learn this?
This dudes friend has turned into a dog, and now he is trying to adjust, this is a mother fucking Disney movie
So. Many. Questions.

Who pays? I don't think that bum with him has any money.
Talk about a service dog.
*won't stop walking down the meat aisle*
"Greg I can not believe you forgot the shopping list again"
It's all fun and games till you get to the treat aisle 
I like how the dog does a double take on the camera... way too similar to me.
How the hell does one go about teaching a dog to do this?

My dog just bashed his head into a fucking door for no reason. I love him but gifs like this make me annoyed at how incomprehensibly stupid he is.  
"Hurr durr I'm a human."
People, please get your fucking dogs out of grocery stores and restaurants. (Unless of course it's a legit service dog) I love my dogs too, but I don't want them farting all over the produce. 
I would be calling back my weed dealer ASAP.
Dogs will be humanity's last hope in the brink of extinction I'm calling it
Now that's service!
That good boy seems to be very happy to help.  I wish my boyfriend could be like that when we shop...
/u/calcu-lass   This is something I see and think of you. 
Typical German Shepard ... " this is my job", even if he is confused :) 
Wait one damn second that man is holding the cart, you can see his hand at the very end! Cripes! We've been had!
German quality
Day 1089: They still haven't noticed me. I have become one of them. 
Actually that dog isn't helping. The man in front of him is another shopper and the dog drive himself to the store to get his own groceries. 
Reminds me of Scooby Doo.
Only a German Shepherd

Dog: Dave go ahead and fuck my hips up
 
Dave: I got you dawg
all i see is that great doggo losing years off his life to hip dysplasia
If I was high and seen that I probably woulda tripped the heck out lol
I should have gotten this kind instead of a chihuahua
This may have cancelled out this entire shitty week.  Thanks OP.
German Shoppard
"Where are my testicles, Summer?"
Not good for his hips. 
That's cute and all, but there's a reason you always see dogs tied outside of grocery stores.
One more reason on why I should have a German Shepard <3
that's one step short of scooby!
Now if I can only teach my dogs to be good helpers like that. 
They at Aldis?  
Does anyone else hate how Wal-Mart lays out their stores? 
This is a double or triple take if I'm in the store with that happening.
That's my kind of service dog
What so you mean he's not a service dog, just look at him!
And then people touch it‚Ä¶
Fallout 5: Walmart
So now when I see a service dog, I expect to see the dog doing the shopping and the customer on a leash. 
That dude has a giant backpack. The dog is a distraction for his shoplifting scheme. Loss Prevention stands no chance. 
What kind of sorcery is this ? Dogs really are a mans best friend. 
I feel like that dog probably handles responsibility better than i do... Whenever i'm handed one of those carts i try to give them to whomever im with or discarding them and try instead to stack whatever im buying in my own hands. Driving those can be very intimidating, you have to account for the people around you not to hit them, those aisles whenever you touch one of them everything falls on you. And don't get me started on the narrow ones where you have to leave the cart on side and be afraid of it getting lost or pushed away, specially if you have something you've already paid for inside. Oh, and those looks you getting for looking young with no one to help pay for what you're carrying. 
Its the future, where man and furkind live in harmony while shopping for groceries üõí
I need this in my life 
Love those Germans
Dog's looking around at all these people standing just watching him like "hey why am I the only one pushing???"

and then you magically find 5 bags of high quality dog treats in your cart.
If evolution is true why haven't dogs evolved to walking upright?!? Can you imagine...
what a time to be alive
I was so mesmerised, I just realised that I watched this like 10 times...
That is the coolest thing I every seen!!! I wish my dog could do that
I need this in my life

In a matter of 6 hours I have seen this video all over every one of my social medias

Wow I never expected this
People of Walmart 
This is dog labor. You must compensate for the job.
That's badass
This is the end times. Animals and robots are now performing human functions.
I see it, but I don't believe it.

Now that's a service dog.
This would be the point where I question if what I smoked earlier was really weed. 
Remember the last time people on Reddit were upvoting a dog walking on two legs and it turned out it has been abused.
Everyone is worrying about Trump, we should worry about the dogs taking over.... 
Serious question: Is that a service animal trained to do that?  
Not serious question: Who's a good boy?!?
Ahahahaha! Holy Mother of Mary üò≠
Is this just a usual thing in the states to take your pet into shops? 
They're evolving 
Aww. Give that boy some treats.
When you're high af but you try to play it cool
 Damn, I can't even get my kids to help like that
This is cute AF but also you should be careful of the hind legs of Shepard's. They can are more susceptible to arthritis

Now *that's* a service animal!
something about this just feels off.

there's always weird customers in walmart stores.
There's just something very creepy about seeing animals walk on two legs.
Now THAT'S a service animal!! 
He's a thruffty shopper
Omg üòçüòçüòç

Yet all my dog does is sleep on the couch. üòë
Is that a pop up tent on his back or a jet pack?
Is this bad for their hind legs?
Evolution of dogs. They now can walk like us and shop like us.
This way to the meat department. No more kibble for me. 
Maximizing the use of a service dog. 
can you train him to run over my heels like my kids do?
My husband was just complaining today that he couldn't take our Shepherd in the grocery store, and I said of course they don't let dogs in the store. GSD's in grocery stores 1, My stupid ideology 0 (I've quite happy to lose this). 
I wanna see good boy telling hooman that they 'will come back for it later'. 
I bet he goes straight to the pet care aisle every time

You really missed your chance to post this as your dog acting during the solar eclipse 
And then, the dogs conquered the world! 
Great. Now that the see how awesome it is to walk upright, the next fool will show them how awesome it is to have opposable thumbs. We're screwed.

Imagine being high as fuck or off some acid in the store and seeing this. God it would make my day and make me question my sanity
That's one way of commanding Dogmeat about..
What the fuck
If this video was taken in the bay area then I'm 90% sure I've seen this guy. He was training the dog if I'm correct.
*Only service animals allowed* 

"Does this count?"
might be hard on the dog's knees 
I feel sorry for the dog. It seems it's tied ,it can't do other thing than walk at the same rhythm its owner pulls the cart.
What kind of supermarket allows animals???
Damn, fursuits are getting hella realistic these days...
Alright folks - this is quite dumb and stupid, there's more photos on r/earthporn which will make your day 
Should the dog not tie up the man and leave him outside too? 
If he has a speaker playing a prerecorded conversation based on that isle of food I'll rub his belly.

Is that a seeing eye dog
Can someone edit this and have Rick and Morty open a portal through here? 
I wouldn't be surprised if Dave Grohl listened to and liked a lot of 80s styled pop music as well as hair metal but was too ashamed or embarrassed to admit it in public or to Kurt or Krist. 

He has said he listens to a lot of diverse music even in the current mainstream scene so I wouldn't be surprised at all if he enjoys hip Hop, R&B and dance-pop.
This is cute but makes me cringe for his hips in the future. Big dogs are so susceptible to dysplasia and arthritis. 
Oh wow I have twitter too

Love Dogs they're Grrreat  :) 
This made me laugh. Just wow lol. 
Dogs are smart and some of them are good workers. What is really surprising for me is a convenience store allowing dogs to enter.
Where is this! I need to bring my dog shopping holy shit.
Hurdur, look at me. Im a humon. Im shopping and i have no time for walkies

Tell me again.... what aisle number is the treats?  Wait..... wait.... 
"Sir, sir.. T-This is mine. Sir? Let go, I had this first! Why is everyone filming?! Help."
"You sure are lazy, hooman".
I'm trying to figure out what this store is. It looks like a fred Meyer.
Fake video
WHY ISN'T THIS LONGER?

(Sorry for the caps, but we need longer videos for videos like this one, really.)
The dog is on a tight leash connected the top front of the cart.  This is not a "trick", the dog physically can't go down. This is animal abuse. 
"You better fucking ring up that big bag of dog food Dave"
I keep watching it and something looks weird on the shadows... I'm sure it happened! We have video?
This looks so cruel üòÇ, but at the same time teaching your dog to do that is pretty Pawwsome 
Boo! Pets should not be allowed in grocery stores.
Wouldn't that just aggravate the hereditary hip issues in most GSDs?
Beyond cruel...
Unless your blind your dog should be outside. Very dirty
I'd pay $2k for someone to teach my dog to do this and I don't even have $2k. 
They see me strollin'
They 'good boy'n'
Is this a grocery outlet?
First I thought it's animal abuse but than... I mean why not the dog doesn't seem like he don't like it
So..... who's gonna train their dog to do this now?
This dog is not to be trusted. He's up to no good trying to shop like people would
Why do people feel the need to bring their non service dogs into grocery stores?
This is not an okay post. If you look closely, you'll see that the dog has a leash tied to the cart and its collar. If it lets go of the cart, it'll choke, and it knows that. Its scumbag "owner" is taking advantage of its survival instincts to push the cart for it.
I love this!
i just want to know how long it took the owner to train his dog to do this 
This was taken in Colorado...wasn't it?
"I want to pick out the dog treats."

The man is pulling the cart while the dog's leash is tied to the handle.
Now that's a verified good boy.

I like how he looks over to the camera like "wtf are you recording Jeff? You never seen a dog push a cart?"
They see me rolling, they hating..
"Nice guide-human, can I pet him?" "Sorry, no, he's working, and I have to be strict about reinforcing proper behavior. Besides, he tends to hump anyone showing him attention".

Wow, really helpful 
Damn, I hate to be that guy on reddit, but all I can think is that dog bone structure is not meant to stand upright and be bipedal. 

And worse so, I believe German Shepherds are known to be more likely to have hip and back problems when they get older. 

Cool trick though. 
Why you no act like dog?
Only at Grocery Outlet!!!!

"I'm hooman! You can't kick me out if I shop here!"
Pretty sure this is at the Grocery Outlet in Milpitas, CA. I used to shop there quite frequently (the layout looks just like it), and there is a gentleman that shops there that has been training a German Shepherd to be a service dog.
I love how he looked to make sure he could go like a human would

The hunt for the goodest boy is over 
r/WhyWereTheyFilming
Section 114259.5 of the California Retail Food Code says that "live animals may not be allowed in a food facility." AND The U.S. Justice Department issued new rules in 2011, saying that service dogs, such as guide dogs for the blind, can go anywhere their person goes, including grocery stores. So-called therapy dogs, on the other hand, do not enjoy such federal protection.
HE IS DOIN A HECKIN STEER!

This is pawwpycock
I like dogs, but, assuming this is the U.S., that doesn't look like a service dog (lacks the harness/vest, even dogs for emotional/psychological assistance require those) and so doesn't belong in a grocery store.

We have health codes for a reason. Just because this one is a good boy doesn't mean they all are.
This is just the first step in dog domination. First they want to be like us. Then they want to BE US.
He thinks he's people. 
Dogs will be humanity's last hope in the brink of extinction I'm calling it
Kill it! Kill it before it attacks the deli section
Nope, sorry. Dogs shouldn't walk on their hind legs. They are not designed for that amount of weight, that's what front legs are for. 
My lord... Is that legal?
We don't deserve dogs.
This is quite gross honestly.
