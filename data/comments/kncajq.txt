Look at his tail in the second picture, he is so happy he can‚Äôt stop it!
Bravo! I hate seeing fat critters. It takes real love and dedication to get this little one into shape.
Impressive.  Diet Milk bones do the trick ?
How the hell did they get SO fat? Looks like he could probably barely even walk. Glad to see the loss.
This is amazing!  I‚Äôm really surprised his skin isn‚Äôt all loose.
And look at that tail GO!
I‚Äôm working on my blue heeler. He spent a year with Grandma and gained so much weight. He went from 40lbs to 60-65lbs. We‚Äôre both going to hit exercise hard this year.
This is my great uncles dog? I have no idea why it just popped up here but thats pretty crazy. He was in bad health so she took the dog in after he passed and put him on a diet I know there's an Instagram page somewhere of it. Really weird ass coincidence tho
2021 goals
His name is Dennis.  [He was on CBS This Morning back in the day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF9CZlhu1mE)
The ‚Äúbefore‚Äù-picture looks like one of those medieval paintings, where the livestock was made to almost rectangle like proportions. To symbolise wealth or something...!

Glad this one is doing better now! :)

EDIT: Example of such a painting.

Someone cared enough to save his life üíï
I like how it's smiling in both.
Please please please post this on r/dechonkers!
I wanted to make a hot dog joke but i dont know my saugages....


Good for him btw!
If a dog could lose 80% of his body weight, surely I can lose 10-20% of mine.
This is like a Human at 1100lb losing down to 180lb, Very impressive.
holy fuck 56?! good god
This is my inspiration
That tail is a blur lol
My lady said, "He looks so happy in the before picture" 

I said "Baby, he's most likely literally struggling to breath cause of all that fat around his, everything. Probably panting all the time. The after photo is how he breaths normal, mouth closed, through his nose."
Whomever let that dog get to 56 lbs is a piece of shit
Saved its life!
He is so cute
this dog (and their owner) deserve high praise!
a 56 pound DACHSUND?  So fucking negligent, good on you for getting that little one back to health!
Wow I need the secret
I guarantee he is 1000% happier now.
If a dog can lose that much, then we all can!
**PSA from a trainer:**

Measure your dog's food people. Stop using a coffee mug, child's cup, weird scoop you have, or anything other than an actual measuring cup. You can use a cheap plastic one. 

The guidelines on the bag are generally always high. After all they want you to go through food so you can buy more. Additionally, dogs are individuals. Their lifestyle, just like ours, will dictate how many calories they need in a day. An active working dog, like one who is literally working livestock all day, needs a different amount of calories than your dog who goes on 45 minutes of slow walks and maybe gets a ball tossed around. 

A pretty good rule of thumb is to follow [this visual body condition chart](https://www.thedrakecenter.com/sites/default/files/BCS-Canine.jpg), and only feed the dog the amount for their healthy weight. If your dog is 80# and should be 60 -  don't feed them the 80# amount. 

Also, pro tip: The majority of "picky dogs" aren't picky. They're just fat and not hungry, but will still be interested and will eat table scraps or other things that are "better" than their kibble. If your dog is not able to finish their meals in one go, it's too much food. 

**How to slim your dog down**

I'm not a vet, this is not medical advice. Take it with a grain of salt. Fat dogs come to me ALL the time for training and our first course of action is to get the weight down. Obesity affects your dog behaviorally in different ways, which can make solving an issue without addressing the weight pretty futile. 

Make sure you're feeding the right amount, *measure it*. Check your treats, there are tons that are very high calorie and essentially flavored balls of fat and shit you don't want in your dog anyways. Either stop giving treats or switch to a healthy alternative: boiled chicken breast, small bits of apple, green beans, broccoli, carrot. You can also use your dog's kibble as their treats throughout the day, **just make sure it's part of their meal you've measured out**. 

It's ok for your dog to act hungry and pester you for food. After all that's probably what got them food/treats in the past and into being overweight. They're not starving, they're just begging and trying to manipulate you for more treats. Imagine if you could get easy money out of someone by being a little bit of a thorn in their side, you'd do it too. Cut your dog off, or reserve some of their daily rations to treat them with. 

Next lets talk about exercise. This is NEVER the first thing we do. Food/meal adjustment is always the first thing you want to address. Extra weight of any kind is very hard on your dog's joints and most dogs who are overweight would be borderline morbidly obese if they were humans. The stress and strain on the dog's body rules out hard exercise. Avoid hard surfaces like pavement if walking your dog. Avoid running them or having them go up and down stairs. Avoid them doing very repetitive and strenuous activities like fetch. 

Swimming, walking/playing in sand, these are the best things to do. Alternatively walking or doing light jogging on grass is also good, but higher impact. 

Exercise shouldn't be the only thing you're doing. It really isn't that effective on its own and as mentioned it's hell on already strained joints. Modifying food is the best way to get the weight off. Hands down.
The tail wag though.
the before has a real "morbidly obese stand-up comedian on open mic night" vibe to it
That tail though!
Damn if a dog did it than I could do it it‚Äôs just I got no motivation at all can‚Äôt find itüòî
Bless his heart
That helicopter tail is going!
Jabba to Salacious
Where‚Äôs the excess skin?
Geeze! Like you got a new dog or something! Congrats op! How long did he take?
The entire dachshund line is so inbred due to poor breeding practises
#CHONKERS
I must say this is the first time I prefer the smaller weiner...
no way that is over 50 pounds. but great weight loss all the same
How would anyone allow the dog to get that overweight to begin with?
Where is all the extra skin?
Why would someone do this to a dog? I mean what did they feed that poor baby? So glad it‚Äôs healthy now!
my spirit animal
Chonky to hunky. Good job!
Wow! I wish I could get that kind of progress on my treadmill! üòâ
Plot twist: he started doing cocaine
What the hell do people feed their dogs? Full packets of hot dogs and a 5lb wheel of cheese for dinner? Holy shit. The dog shouldn't eat his own bodyweight for dinner. He's about 6.5x his normal weight - for comparison, that means a 170lb man would be 1,105lbs (which presumably means you'd just explode like the insanely fat guy in Monty Python).
If he can do it so can I!!! Or like, the equivalent thereof because I have no interest in weighing only 9 pounds!!!
And changed his eye colour? Could be the lighting but that looks like a different dog entirely.
Skinny legend!
Wow, he was way too big, poor guy! My dachshund was 28 lbs when I adopted him and he quickly got down to 12. Dachshunds especially should not be overweight, their poor backs can't handle it.
I hope whoever got that dog up to 56 lbs is dead
Holy crap! My hound mix is 50lbs and I cannot comprehend a dachshund beings heavier than him. Poor guy. Glad to see he‚Äôs at a healthy weight now!
*heavy breathing*
OMG SO PRECIOUS BOTH PUP AND OWNER BE PROUDDD
Canine Keto!
That should be me, and every obese Redditor
That doggie was a bratwurst
Even slimmed it's ears!
Dude lost like 4 dogs.
 VETS HATE HIM
Looks like a recent before and after of Kevin Smith
And it's life is saved.
HE WAS A THIIIIIICCCKKK ASSS BOY
That poor thing must have hurt to walk.
From CHONK to STRONK
Oh god and the doctor said my 15 pounder was chonky holy sheeet
jesus what a fat piece of shit
That‚Äôs a heckin impressive dechonk
Wow! This reminds me of me during covid, except the opposite happened.
That‚Äôs an unbelievable change
Big thicccc chungus
How in the fuckin hell does a dog like that reach 56lb?! Not to sound morbid, but I'm shocked they didn't die.
I wish I could drop 47 pounds, dang. That‚Äôs awesome, super happy for him (her?)
from chunk to hunk
Well damn if he can do it so can I!! Game on!! He‚Äôll be my poster child...my inspiration! Now all I need now is some diet dog food and I‚Äôm good to go!
How tf did he get to 56 pounds in the first place?? Someone was not taking care of him properly.
went from "OH LAWD HE COMIN" to "a fine boi", some mighty great work you've done here!
üòävery impressive!
1)gets rid of fat dog 
2)buys new skinny same looking dog
3) profit

Lol jk congrats on weight loss
I just pictured lifting a 56 pound dashund....what a meat package.
Now do me!
I need to know his secret. I have gained so much under the pandemic it hurts
He looks so happy as a little chungus though. I know it‚Äôs not healthy, but look at his little smile!
C H O N K
Fuck people who let their pets get this fat
That‚Äôs one chonky boi
Glad he is at a healthy weight
Where is all his stretched out skin? Why doesn‚Äôt he need to get a body lift? People do after massive weight loss?  He is adorable, tho and much healthier!
It's always so horrifying to see animals mistreated like this. So glad this little guy is healthy now.
Scrolled all the way down here and didn‚Äôt find a FAT WIENER joke? Wack.
[deleted]
Incredible!  This makes me want to throat punch the previous owner though
Fake. Second dog has less grey hair than first dog, meaning he's actually younger. Account has one other post, just started the account today. Fake as fuck.
chonk to chonkn't
He mustard been working out a lot
WOW, this is incredible.  How long did it take to lose the weight?
Dachsunds are weird as fuck but very cool.

My friends likes to eat the whiskers off their cat, and if you fall asleep on the couch or something it will try to eat your hair.
This would be like me going from 1150 lbs down to my current normal weight.
Look at that tail go!
Dachshunds are life
*as they stare into the mirror*
The Kevin Smith of dogs
Subway diet or???
Slim n‚Äô Trim!
Where do I sign up for this weight loss plan?
Tell me your secret master
Good job. I bet it feels so much better! Sure looks better! Keep it up.
Jesus that‚Äôs the fattest dachshund I‚Äôve ever seen. Was I mean. He looks so healthy now!
Reminds me of the overstuffed seal in the marine room at the natural History Museum (UK) üòÇ
ü•∫
Chonky
Great job little buddy!
Big boi turned into a smol boi
Hyperchonk
how? did you get a new dog?
She's gorgeous!  

And I'm next!
Doggo is gorgeous again !
L O A F B O Y E
Before pic looks like a big Twinkie
That tail is in warp speed lol
Sounds more like a crash-hound
Dachshunds can't even function as normal dogs as it is. Poor guy.
Me in 2021 (hopefully) quarantine has fuckin fatted me the hell up
What a chungus wow
Come on!!! Who could possibly let this happen? It's a wonder his little back wasn't broken.
My staffie is 56 pounds. I cannot imagine what that much weight would do to the body of a dachshund.
It‚Äôs in reverse
What about the baggy skin? Does he have to go to the vet for a procedure?
I bet you got tired of the dog demanding you bring him solo and the wookie. lol. Nice work.
Reverse Bib Fortuna
"You see this tail moving? No? It's cause im so fast!"
Holy fucking shit, both to the before picture & the incredible weight loss.
I couldn't imagine a dachshund weighing 10 lbs less then my fully grown German shepherd
56lbs?  Yikes!  Glad they got healthy.
The before photo looks like Ferdinand from Tom and Jerry the movie
Thank you for taking this sweet pup from chunk to hunk!  A healthy dog is a happy dog üê∂‚ù§Ô∏è
Congratulations! That‚Äôs how you show love! Your doggie looks like such a sweetheart, too!
56 HOLY MOSES!
I bet that is one stretchy pooch!
Care to share what happened to the loose skin?
GET IT BRO üí™üèΩ
Subway eat fresh, your dog might be a pedophile.
AW YAY
What a transformation! The puppy worked hard
Can you imagine the stretch marks?
I love how you can tell the tail is wagging
How does a dachshund even get that fat? Literally even with negligence or not properly taking care of your animal, how does a dog that small get so huge?
God, I wish you could be my ‚Äúowner‚Äù for a year and put me on a diet and exercise regime. I‚Äôm so jealous that my dogs have someone (me) controlling their appetites.
holy shit that is some work to get that baby down to 9 pounds.
How the fuck do you let your pet get that fat? I have three dogs(small lap dog types) and a cat and all of them get 1 cup of food a day. Like are people feeding their dogs just table scraps and not playing outside with them or taking them in walks?
I love how his tail is a blur because it‚Äôs wagging
That‚Äôs not the same dog...
This is the best. Thanks for bringing this picture into my life!
Wow! Great job! I feel like overweight dogs are neglected. Idc what way you put it. So glad there‚Äôs a great outcome!
My cousin has a 60 lbs maltise that looks like a keg with legs. The poor thing needs to be held to go up and down stairs. Its sick. She says she loves him so much she needs to just feed him human food and give him whatever he wants.  He looks like if you poked him with a needle he would burst.
Wow that‚Äôs nuts
he must feel SOOO MUCH better. My dad had to husky which were, well, too husky! One of them had really bad arthritis and had to take pain pills, had a hard time walking because all the extra weight! But my dad put them on a diet, (no more slices of cheese) and took them for a lot of walks, and they lost weight! The girl, Aurora, had to do walks in a pool at first. Poor girl. BUT BUT after losing the weight the arthritis pretty much went away!
Can you do this to me now?
How do you do it
He lost 6.22 other Dachshunds!!
That‚Äôs one hot dog üòÇ but seriously, I‚Äôm glad the owners went on this journey for his health ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I think there needs to be a new level added to the body condition score for the photo on the left. I never thought anything to that magnitude could exist. The work involved in this transformation must have been immense. So glad to see how comfortable he‚Äôs looking now!
Chonk to noodle
I feel like that first one belongs in r/absoluteunits
now this is the weight loss journey I wanna see :>
That is great!  We have a dachshund at the SD Humane Society that is 31 lbs.  Hoping they find a dedicated foster or owner
What is your dog‚Äôs secret ?
Where did all the extra skin and fur go though?
Holy back problems. #1 thing is don‚Äôt let a dachshund get heavy.
Can someone crosspost this to r/My600LbDachsund?
https://imgur.com/a/88baIrk
He was great in The Machinist.
Pets on diets is the best thing
Wow! Still looks derpy as hell :)
56 pounds??? Good for these owners helping him out!!
So glad the owners decided to save their dog from all those health issues!
Lost 86.2% of his body weight.
Hope this is true
What the heck how do you grow a miniature dachshund to 56 pounds?
Holy shit this is some r/GetMotivated
I need to do this!
And here I feel bad because my shepard mix is 5-10 lbs overweight, shes in the low 60s but should be mid 50s ideally. 

What horrible humans this dachshund had before.
That is insane.

Do the math. That‚Äôs like an 800 lbs woman getting down to 133 lbs.
I had a room mate that his dog was likely 10 pounds off from the before when I moved in. I was a jerk of a room mate because I was told not to play fetch with the dog because she would get obsessed with tennis balls. 

So I played fetch with her as much as possible and she dropped nearly half her weight.
Blurry tails are a good thing
Fuuuck, that dog looks horrible in the first picture.

Second dog is an entirely different creature, kudos to you.
  
Luckily for successful weight loss
My doggo is epileptic and since starting his treatment over the past year a mixture of him being tired from seizures/ medication and the medication making him gain weight. Can I ask what sort of things you did to help? Griff is only slightly overweight but the vets say it‚Äôs something we should keep a close eye on
Can someone adopt me and do the same.
I need this kind of motivation...for myself
Holy crap. Wow.
Looks so handsome and so healthy now, incredible.
The Keto diet works WONDERS! lol
How do you get a dachshund to 56 pounds?????
Look at that happy little tail!!
poor dogo.. satified human?

Thank you so much.   Don't overfeed your dogs.

Outstanding.  Congratulations ‚≠êÔ∏è!

So from 56 pounds to 9 pounds? Is this ‚Äúbefore‚Äù the canine equivalent of a human on r/My600lbLife? ü§î
If this pretty dog can lose weight, so can i!
Awww Chub Chub
Look like a loaf of bread
Damn, poor little dude was over half of the weight of my Collie.
goddamn wagging his tail at 300 kmph
DAMN BOI HE THICC! THAT‚ÄôS A THICC ASS BOI!!
I love how the doggo's always happy
im proud of them <3
This is like me pre and post COVID.
unchonk'd
People always comment that our mini Aussie is fat but she‚Äôs a perfect weight the vet said. I hope they don‚Äôt give her a complex
JFC, can you even imagine picking up the ham loaf unit that is a *56 pound dachshund??*
my favourite part is the happy tail blur.
Yayyy
left is me on thanks giving
He looks happy in both
Was his nickname Jabba?
How fatphobic /s
Poor thing was probably miserable. Looking good now though!
Chonky hot dog
My 56 lbs life
not gonna lie, the picture on the left makes your figurative hot dog look like a literal hot dog.
[Reminds me of that obese dog on a skateboard in the Tom and Jerry Movie from the 90s.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGM31o1z85o)
If that dog can do than so can I!
Congratulations üçæ little one..üíïüíï
Dogs lose a massive amount of weight but they have no evidence of it like a human would (extra skin, etc). Weird
Great big, big ole thick'ms
awwww such a cutie
Adorable
Amazing

Holy fuck who did that to them in the before pic
I think thats a little too thin, he looks anxious.

Handsome little guy. So cute.
I‚Äôm gonna commit a hate crime on whoever made the dog that fat before
Chonky Doo to Scrabby Doo.
My guy went from Johnny sins size to dudes named Hank.
Such dedication! I hope he enjoys being able to play and move a lot more
What is his secret
Aww this pup got some years back to his life. I love chonky animals, but he was morbidly obese. I‚Äôm glad his owners decided to get him healthy again.
OH LAWD HE fine
Wow! Thank you for doing this!
he went from a full-on buffet to a snack
This is the best progress pic I've seen all year. Well done, buddy.
My medium-biggish mutt is 40 lbs and a tad heavier than she should be. I can't imagine a little dachshund getting to 56 lbs. The poor baby! Glad they were able to get better.
Wow, that pup looks so healthy now
Thank god he graduated from r/chonkers
How do you even get those dogs past 40 pounds without them fucking dying?
Wish my dogs would use a treadmill but the ladt time i tried to put our lab on one he almost crapped himself
Folks everywhere get their dogs fat because they are unwilling to to train their dogs to not beg for food.  They also buy treats that are crazy full of garbage and calories.  Yes, I give my dog treats, but I use her food out of the amount she eats daily.  Yes, she gets very excited for it.  I also give her a few blueberries as a treat....also a bit of banana, or bits peaches.  She never begs because we ignore it, and dogs get that very quickly.  If you truly love your pup, don‚Äôt allow them to be obese.
But people forget that because of the neglect from the owner the dog became that unhealthy weight
How many hours?
This is so amazing. I wish him(?) a long, happy, healthy life. Good job.
Look at that little tag-waggin potato!!! Omg so cute
Switch sides of before and after
What's the story behind this bundle of floof?
A big ol Chonker to a stud .
Ok, now how do I do this?
Your dog went from Kevin Smith in The 2000s to Kevin Smith in 2020
I hope you didn't flip the before & after.
Went from bratwurst to regular weiner.
Chonkkkkyyy
Congrats and all but amagad what a chonker!!!
Once again we aww at a fat animal getting skinny but why haven‚Äôt we beaten the person who did that to this poor animal
Photoshop!      /s
Nice!
Not enough people on this sub are willing to put in the effort to make sure they‚Äôre pets are healthy. Good work!
Look at that tail waggin! ‚ô•Ô∏è

Good job skinny mini! I bet that took some hard work and help from your humans. You look beautiful and healthy ‚ù§Ô∏è
He's healthier now! Longevity goal
Somebody went to Grandma's for a month
He looks so much happier and healthier.
holy fuck thats one hell of a weight loss
What the hell were they feeding that thing?!!
How did you get him thin?  My dog is fat.  Don't know how to address the problem..
Both are snuggable, one is snuggable for longer
Dr Now would be very pleased
Oh that poor little thing!  Even carrying around all that extra weight, he still had a smile and bright eyes for the person trying to help him!
any tips on a 14 year old daschund? he isn‚Äôt moving much seems ok but i don‚Äôt want to over feed him. his legs aren‚Äôt as strong as they used to be
I like how he‚Äôs happy in both
That‚Äôs amazing!!!
I need to do whatever she did.
It looks like Kevin Smith‚Äôs before and after photos! Hahahaha
This dog be lookin like bred
I love seeing posts like this! It's amazing to see people work to improve their pets' health; especially these days with COVID reducing everyone's activity. I see subs like r/chonkers and it just makes me feel sick knowing that there's hundreds of thousands of people that think pet obesity is cute. Very glad to see someone work to turn it back around!
r/getmotivated
Dog weight loss is on the front page of the internet... ugh.
Plot twist: the pics are switched and OP took a healthy thin dog and over feed it for some sweet karma points.
That‚Äôs a big poop
That was one hefty dachshund! My baby looks fatter than he really is because of the meds he is on. It's not easy because he's always hungry and gets greedier by the year. It's hard to resist his little face, but it's for his own good.
Imagine how well that doggy can fit into a pair of jeans!
The before picture makes me super angry.
Went from BIG glizzy dog, to PERFECT Glizzy dog
De-chonked
Wow so proud
Give me the diet
CHONK
Cute boi :3
So question. And thank you ahead for response if I dont respond back and sorry if its a dumb question.
Did s/he need procedures done for the extra skin after losing the weight?
Looking good sweet thing
That's like me on reverse.
i‚Äôm so proud
How did he lose that weight? If I could lose that much weight I‚Äôd be so skinny
The average thanksgiving turkey is 15lb. That dog was not, nor ever could be, nearly 4 thankgiving turkeys. OP is a liar.
My lord. What a journey that little one has lived.
Both images are cute but id rather have the healthy long living pup
Wow, he went from hot dog bun to the hot dog! That makes me so happy.
56 pounds holy shit, my 8 year old human child weighs less than that.
Big chungus
Awesome!
Plus unlike humans, all the extra skin will be cute!
wow, how did it get that bad? if you dont mine me asking
The fuck did you feed that thing.
But thinking the same thing in both pics...Is that food your holding?
Looking forward to this kind of transformation post pandemic.
Hefty Hefty Hefty
Throw a dog a bone.
He pulled a reverse american!
CHONK!!!
My spirit animal.
Belongs on r/intermittentfasting
did the reverse really happen??
FIFTY SIX POUNDS.....down to NINE?!?!?! How does a Dachshund get to 56 pounds? My goodness.
I thought it was a seal pup for a second. Glad they dropped it all.
How did it even get like that
Down from Bratwurst doggie to Weiner dog.
From chonky to slonky
congrats epic gamer dog

Where‚Äôd he go!?
Thank god. Truly.
What an insPAWration!
 One time in the grocery store I met a dachshund named Megan. I thought it was so odd I‚Äôve never heard of an animal named Megan ...
If this dog can do it, then I have no excuse. For real.
I want its time lapse
....what if it‚Äôs in reverse
What a good boi
56 *POUNDS?*

My husky weighs 36...
#Dachshunduitz
I like how he's happy in both
So happy now üòÜ
OMG! What a good boy!
The first image is so goddamn sad. Poor animal.
This picture is before-after and after-before
Much better
Holy shit that seems impossible
I guess I need the dachshund diet
If Chris Farley was a dog
People are saying it looked happier fat but I think it‚Äôs just having trouble breathing
Poor dog, all that weight is so hard on its little bones. Good job pup loosing it.
He is less than a sixth of his former weight that's wild. Good for him, though!
My doggo just went on a diet. We are trading out snacks for belly rubs and getting out for a run around a field most days. She‚Äôs a lab mix who got a little chonky. 
Kudos to getting this dog to a petite 9 lbs!
wow!
I like the fat one better
Looks like a bigger smile when fat. Interesting.
I‚Äôve never seen a dog so fat that their ears are fat...
What a chonk, it is almost hard to believe.
The first picture of the dog makes him look like the demon that he is, a speed demon.
That‚Äôs a heccin chonker
how tf can someone even allow their pet to get that morbidly obese?

like I am in awe right now.
chonkers to bonkers
Damn boy he thiccc
***CHONK***
What r/chonkers should have been.
From 2k dog to 200k dog.
He was one heckin chonker
Concrats for actually caring about your pet as opposed to just posting the left picture captioned ‚ÄúChonker‚Äú
If he can do it, I can do it!
That‚Äôs like a 750 pound person losing 600 pounds!?
He‚Äôs still cute either way aww ü•∫ü•∫
From redditor to Chad.
Holy shit, just running a few quick numbers here he was 6.22 times heavier in his first picture than his second.  If I was 6.22 time slather than I am now I would be just a bit over half a friggin ton.  Jesus Christ, good job little buddy.
He gives the rest of us hope. Although dieting is much easier when somebody literally forces you.
I like em big, I like em' chonky, except dis doggy.
they lost chonker status
He looked like those fat people in sprited away
Awesome work!
TEACH ME THE WAYS!
What did you feed him ? Buckets of lard ??
Scooby the ween
Hot dog!
New year new wee
In Germany we would say: Wie kann ein Hund so fett werden.
Wow that is what I call a hero! Cheers also to his pawrents for the effort and endurance to help him!
He also recovered his soul omg
Nice, but how did u get dog so fat!?
Chonkster
God fucking damnnnnn that boy was chunky. Amazing work on the transformation lil guy.
That's so great, if he/she stayed 56 pounds he/she probably would have died from so much mass, but I'm so happy that he/she's healthy now and that you'll spend more time with him/her
Aww!
.....and looks quite pissed about it. Way happier before.
Oh lawd thats one thicc boi
Holy crap!  Richard Simmons would be proud
Way to go, doggo!

I don‚Äôt remember this episode of My 600lbs Life?

Cute dog.
Good for him!
O LAWD *he was* COMING
Now I am amazed r/BeAmazed
You have to be a real piece of shit to overfeed a dog like that. Dogs cant just go to the fridge and eat on their own, you have to wantonly overfed the animal. 

You should be happy for the dog but very upset at the asshole owner.
How please? We've got a tubby 14 pound cat that could use some of this magic. Shes already on weight control food
Ahhhhhhhhhh love it
It's the dog in that tom and jerry film! The one that used a skateboard to move! He finally stopped eating like a pig!
Congrats!!!

That's a killer lifestyle change!  Seen YouTube videos of people doing 30 day or 90 day etc body transformations of working out.  


But how come he looks really happy in the first one and kind of skittish in the second?  Still very happy (can see the blur tail!), but the first one he just looks like he's smiling.  :D  


Cute dog, though, in both pics.  \^\_\^
