/r/BeforeNAfterAdoption would appreciate this
It's incredible how much they "blossom" once they're with someone that gives them the love they give us. 
Pretty girl. She looks like a sweetheart.
Good luck saying no to those eyes.  She's a beauty.  
More tennis balls! Now!
What is that wrapped around her?
There is nothing better than the look on a rescued dog's face in an "after" picture. üòç Love love LOVE this! 
You took this sweet pound puppy and gave her life again. She went from hiding in the shadows to a home allowing her happyness (I know) and tennis balls and a new collar and some kind of fleece thingy I don't know about. Thank you.

It‚Äôs [Dog Day](https://i.imgur.com/9y3qw83.jpg) in Nepal. Blessings abound for our canine companions today! Your new confidant is beautiful.
They need a toe nails trimmin 
She's adorable. Congrats!
This warms my heart.
oh i love her!
Oh! You so lucky!! 

Those eyes before...my heart!
Just needed to be wanted.
Omg I love her. 
Thank you for rescuing her!
This makes my heart happy 
Good for you! Rescues are the way to go!
Whoa. My pup had those same eyes and that same expression on her face when I saw her in the pound. So many dogs going nuts, but she would just sit down and give me... that face. She wanted to sit on my lap the whole car ride as I drove her to her new home. She was a full grown goofball the day she came into my life, and 8 years later she is still a big goofus.
Hey just a top tip from a dog owner, your pup looks like her nails need to be cut. See how long they are in the first pic? Unless you've done it already, it's hard to tell from the second one. 

I think it would be uncomfortable for her to run on those. 

Don't be nervous to cut them, it's way easier than it looks!
I still remember adopting my first dog. He was by far the quietest dog in the shelter. Didn't eat cause he was shy. Didn't play. Ended up being so fun and outgoing and my best friend/brother to me for many years. Congrats on your new friend OP. Be ready for a lot of fun and a lifetime of memories 
When I adopted my cat, I took him into the play room at the shelter and he wanted absolutely nothing to do with me, he was honestly such an asshole, wouldn‚Äôt play with me or take any treats I tried to give him but something told me I needed to adopt him. He sleeps with me every night and is the most playful, snuggly cat I‚Äôve ever met. When you know, you know and I can totally relate to how amazing it feels to get them home and see a whole other side of them come out. Congrats on your new fur baby!
When i got my dog from the shelter she sat behind at diy wooden house the shelter people made for the cages. She sat behind that howling and crying. She had a brutal past with abuse and no food. It looked like she had actual tears in her eyes. The shelter owners opened the door to her crate and mentions "nobody ever wanted this one" and i sat down and she came over to me and sat down next to me. and she layed down and licked my hand. So we picked her. She is now 5 years old and the most spoiled dog in the world. Her name is maya. She can pick up 2 balls and throw  them by swinging her head and letting the balls go. She is official good girl. 
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üíóüíóüíóüíó
So awesome 
Reminds me of my St. Bernard/Lab mix, one of my best dogs. Glad you have each other!
#Thank You.    
      
Thank you for being this pup's ray of hope, it's gateway to happiness. Thank you for rescuing it from the cold, hard floors and the noisy, constant barking in the kennel room of some animal control center that, no matter how hard they tried or how many techs they hired, could *never* provide the poor animals kept there with as much love, attention, and belly rubs as they need.      

^^*Warning: ^^belly ^^rubs ^^are* ***^^NOT*** *^^applicable ^^to ^^cats. ^^Proceed ^^at ^^your ^^own ^^risk!*
Aww what a sweetie. Congrats on your new friendship!
Everyone thinks they have the best dog, none of them are wrong. -- W.R. Purche
Your picture should be made into an advertisement for adopting sheltered dogs. The transformation here is just amazing.
I wish I had 100 acres of land and millions of dollars, just so I could adopt every dog I could find. 
THIS is the exact reason I despise the mentality at shelters and pounds. 

"This dog is shy and meek"

"This dog is loud and barky"

"This dog is mean and aggressive"

No fuck you, you have no clue what that dog is like. I've taken home four different shelter dogs, and they ALL did a complete 180 flip from their shelter personality. 

If you want a dog, do dog kind a favor and try fostering or adopting dogs. Put those lowlife puppy mills out of business. KUDOS OP!
What an absolute sweetheart. Give her a heckin boop from me. 
Thank you for rescuing a shelter dog.
 #AdoptDon'tBuy
We got our rescue dog almost a year ago now, we are his third owners. Within days he opened up to my girlfriend, with me it's been a longer haul. It took 6 months to get to the point that he didn't cower in the corner when I entered the room. Little by little he gives me a bit more every day. Following me out of the room, jumping onto the bed in the morning, baring his belly now and again for a quick rub. I'll never understand how someone can be cruel to an animal. 
My first foster was so depressed at the shelter he wouldn't engage with anyone. After 24 hours in a home you couldn't keep him off of you.
This would make a great ad for animal adoption, it makes me want to go adopt another pit bull. 
"Who are you?"

"I live here now"
I see so much of my own dog in that after picture... The grey nose, the eyes, and definitely the goofy indecisiveness of not knowing which ball she wants!

Congratulations on the newest member of your family! I'm sure you two will have many happy years together in your future!
I fostered dogs for a long time and they all went from nervous to like this! Except one, he was fearless and never showed he was nervous even when I first got him. Congrats! 
More pix!
Scratch behind those ears omg
Thank you for rescuing a dog. Thank you. 
That first picture is breaking my heart, thank you so much for taking care of this gorgeous sweetheart.
Omg both photos are like weaponized cuteness.

That's a double barreled shotgun of cuteness.
One Reddit post in and already more karma than me
Man it hurts me to see all the dogs at the pound knowing that if they don‚Äôt get adopted they are going to get put down 
As veterinary technician i must sya that i love this! because i do... also, please be careful with tennis balls, Pit Bulls tend to get those those stuck in their throats when they try catching them from above.... just a friendly heads up
That first gaze broke my heart
She's precious!  Looks like you got yourself a nice pit, or pit mix, going on there.  Welcome to a lifetime of comedic shenanigans and general Tom foolery!  I got a two year old male out of the pound a couple years ago and he's non stop hilarious, every day is a chortle.  He gets grass stuck in his butt and growls at it.  He comes over and sits down by you and gives you "Princess Diana Eyes" when he wants food.  He peed on my horse.  He peed on the dog trainer.  He ate a wasp, crunched it up and spit it out.  He loves ladies bigger than him.  He tried to mount a Neopolitan Mastiff and she woofed at him so he slid off her all nonchalant and looked back over his shoulder like, "lesbian."  He loves putting his little butthole on people, he'll sneak it on your arm or leg if you're not careful.  He can catch a dog treat in his mouth from 12 feet away.  

You are in for a solid 10 years of amusement, I'm so happy for you both! 
What a sweet face!! :)
fuck ya 
Pet her for me!!
Thank you so much for giving her a good home! The first picture is really killing me.
She's beautiful. I love how much more vibrant her eyes look in the second picture. She clearly loves being a part of your family!
When ur first reddit post gets 70k upvotes 
I like all the balls in my mouth, too.  

Seriously, nice rescue.  You‚Äôve earned your wings.
Congrats! I'd be so happy to see that after being unsure how she would be at your home, the complete opposite of a pound.
[deleted]
This looks like the frame before the famous "No take! Only throw." Comic
The shelter pups know how bad it can be, you're her whole world now and she'll love you for it. Congrats. 
So beautiful. Thanks for giving her a good home. That's awesome, and thank you for going to the shelter! I wish more ppl would! :)
Awesome! We have a cat that fits the same description. 
She looks a lot like my dog, congrats!  It's a life changing experience.
think she can do 3 tennis balls?! here's to your goofball pup!
I'm crying
She's a Pibble! Be ready for her to try and crawl in to your endocrine system whenever you lay down! 
This makes me "happysad" if that's a word.  I'm probably going to have to put my old gal to sleep in the next couple days and this was the first post I saw when I jumped to Reddit and it was just the thing I needed to see.  Thanks.
First reddit post, 24.4k karma. The jelly is real.
I know that look... She might be home physically, but her mind isn't. [It hasn't been for 48 years.](https://i.imgur.com/f2rdbNN.jpg)
"Hey new Hooman. I bringded you a tennis ball or two. Maybe you throw?!  Maybe I fetch? Maybe you fren now?" 
THANK YOU FOR ADOPTING!!!
I also got a dog yesterday!!  Congratulations!!!
Her sad face in the pic before breaks my heart. Thank you for not judging her based on her demeanor inside the shelter. Too many get passed up because people look for happy ones. They are all happy animals just not being in a cage passed by most people. Thanks for getting this cute goofball. You saved her life and I'm sure she will give you all her love for all of her days. 
‚ù§Ô∏è
G O O D G I R L E 
Lots of hugs for that good girl
Awh this is the cutest
Oh my God I love her
Is that a thunder jacket?
Those claws need trimming, otherwise you're gonna have some very torn bedsheets.
Whats the blue tape?
she is beautiful! congrats <3
Nice!  Enjoy.
Tank!
I think she can fit one more ball in there.  Congrats, she's adorable.  
Little bit of love is all they need to show their true side. 
If your not ready for a pet don't abuse it, give it someone who cares. 

Way to go. Love from this pup for you is unreal.  She know you saved her. Take care of her and love her. She is the shit.
Amazing
Her eyes look so much like my girl Labrador, you made that dogs life 
Made me actually grin ear to ear - congrats!
What a sweetheart!!! 
I love her.
i like her white shoes.
Awe!!! You will be so in love with him. The best decision and gift you gave to yourself. 
Thank you for getting her OP!
Ah I see she's a Myexgirlfriend Terrier.  
that first pic is simultaneously breaking and warming my heart. 
what a sweet soul. glad you found each other <3
This fills my heart with warmth and happiness. 
Happy tears!! Good on you human. You've just earned yourself a loyal goodball. 
This truly makes my heart melt...Thank you for adopting 
Awww what a sweetie. Congrats on your new companion <3
Goddammit dogs are the best
Awwwwwww. God damn I love dogs. Looks like a Black Lab/Pit Bull mix?
Congrats!! We're (hopefully) picking up our rescue on Saturday :D We just have to have a home visit before officially being approved but the adoption coordinator said that based on our app and phone interview our rescue is pretty much ours <3 Best of luck to you both!
Why isn't there a tennis ball on her nose? :)
Congratulations and Thank you for sharing!! She looks like a sweetheart and she's lucky you found her. I'm sure she's going to bring you so much happiness,  too. We save them, but they end up saving us too. I rescued my lab/coonhound and she is the sweetest, smartest, most loving dog that I ever had. Best Wishes!!
I have a feeling this wonderful gurl got a wonderful owner, hope you two make each other really happy!
Is this one picture? 
So many dog pictures on Reddit. This one is my favorite 
Pitbull lab :) looks just like my Shadow 
First post hits front page and I‚Äôm here like struggling for the karma. 
You saved a pup life. May you both be best friends for as long as possible.
I can't handle this. My heart is melting and I feel like I can't breathe! What a pretty angel!
This is my favorite dog. This is a very powerful picture of her. I love her. Wtf. I dont know what im saying. I dont even know her. I... Im... i need to stay home tonight and sort out some things...
I'm telling y'all ,dogs are a gift sent from God‚òÖ
We foster rescue dogs. Springing them from pound is one of the most beautiful experiences you can imagine, second only to being there for the birth of your children.
My entire soul left and then re-entered my body completely healed and cleaned of all sin 
Those eyes alone speak a thousand fucking words.  Thanks OP, for giving this little girl a chance in this world. She's a beaut!
Dam OP adopt me too. I need love and attention. 
I'm so drunk. I've thrown up. I made a cocktail of leftover gin, vodka, look aid, sake, and sour mix. Had a shaker full of it. Watched my roommates clean. Went outside and heard about my roommates one of my roommates successes in the big city. Then I came here. To Reddit. A place that we get a little too cynical about sometimes.  Then it brings this beautiful pepper. And we can all cry or drunken selves together over miles from eachother. I honestly don't know. I'm drankin'
Somebody call me?
My heart just melted, what a beautiful creature!
Awwwww! What a pretty lady, I hope you both get many happy years together. 
This melts my heart.
Im no doctor but ... What r those lesions in her mouth? The look inflamed miscolored and misshapen 
Your first :)

Now and again they can be hard work, don't give up as the love that dog will give you is incredible.
I know she's in a great place now, but I want to climb in this picture and just hold her on the left. My heart
Oh man that first picture of her timid and peeking. Precious but almost sad. I'm glad you took her home. I hope you get all the happy years with her.
Labra-pitt? I got one too! Mine once got 3 balls in her mouth before she choked. Silly dogs
Looks like she's a pinball wizard.  She triggered multiball.
The first pic breaks my heart.
The first picture makes my heart hurt :(
But what a difference, such a happy girl! well done youüí´
Aww. I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs so happy. Hope you both have an amazing life together.
Wow if ever one photo could say a million words this was it!
Front Page and Gilded on a first post....nice going ! :)
One ball for each of you. Let‚Äôs play. 
All she needed was love x
Omg that's a good girl.  Give her a snuggle for me please
If your dog loves tennis balls and fetch, I HIGHLY recommend you get a chuckit. 
I really love seeing these rescues,hopefully every state will sign,and have no more puppy mills.Congrats on having your new goofball under your roof,i know plenty of years of joy r coming your way.Cheers üëçüèª
Should taken his friend next door too.  He has shifty eyes though.
Pups are always shy at the shelter then after a few weeks with you...they own EVERYTHING
My parents won‚Äôt let me get a dog:( I used to have 3 and I miss them sm
Cut his toenails ffs
First reddit post. 88k+ Karma. Fuck you....*goes to adopt a dog*

Adorable dog though
God love you for getting that sad little face out of there STAT, and into her new home so she could come out of her shell.

MOAR PICS!!
I'll have my first puppy doggy next sunday!!
That pic on the left breaks my heart, but the one on the right mends it rather it quickly.
Toenails need trimming, but be careful.
That went from no trust, to throw these 2 balls and dress me up. Dogs are funny like that.

She is beautiful. Enjoy that happy pupper! 
So cute!!!!  thanks for posting such an adorable fur baby pic.
Hey! Hey! Human?! What the heck are these? They're round and chewy and they bounce OMG!
She is so BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT AND AMAZING. 
Her eyes are pure love.
I'm so glad you saw the real her !!!!! Cheers to both of you enriching each others lives :)))))
Your first post did really really well! Your dog is adorable
Am so happy for the both of y‚Äôall. I love my pupper with all my heart. And I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying. 
Those eyes. My oh my. üòç
That jacket doubles as her cape. Obviously!
God bless you
Seriously such a change.  What a happy pup. You rock!
Name????
I have a dog like this and she gives the best hugs. If you ever feel like your day isn't going ok, hug this dog and it's gonna fix a lot of things. 
I have an adopted English Bulldog and an adopted PomChi...neither one hit the shelter, but I can say, without a doubt, this is how all/most animals look. This post makes my heart really full after I had a pretty shitty day at work.
Great work, new Reddit friend!
Staffy mix? Rescues are the best!
I love how his white paws looks like gauntlets 
Dogs > everything else
Shy, quiet girl who grew up and can now take two balls in her mouth.. pretty sure I went to school with a girl like that
I hope she is forever good to you! My boy Douglas was just as shy when we picked him up, now he is the best doggo 
She looks like a lot of fun.
Looks so sad then so happy. Awesome stuff, doggo deserves even more tennis balls for being such a good pupper
1st post and you've already hit the top. Thank your pupper for being so memigenic.
Note to all robots: In this instance Goofball is complimentary and not derogatory.  LOL!
Oh my God. What an angel. <3
Conratulations on your new best friend :)
you better take good care of that dog
In the picture on the right you can just see the love and affection in her eyes and it is just so beautiful and so heartwarming and my heart has now offically melted after looking at those eyes.
TWO tennis balls!!!??  WHAT A GOOD GIRL!!
That face in the first picture! My heart! Then the beautiful second picture. Ahhhhh üòª
She is SO frickin cute!!!!
I hate how scared and sad dogs look in the ‚Äòbefore‚Äô pictures, but how happy they are in the ‚Äòafter‚Äô shots always makes up for it.
So cute :3
Nice first post!
Naughtyyyyyy!
What a pretty girl! I can tell she loves her forever home. 
Bless you for rescuing this goofball!
Holy matrimony, how many tennis balls did that pup swallow?
Cutie pie

Aw. Great post. Happy for you both! Bless his little heart 
I typically hate these posts, but this one is too too good.
Awwwww love him he's so awesome!! Congrats and have lotsa fun
Whooo's a good human?  You are! Yes you are!
She's happy to be home!
Awe this made my day!!! So heart warming to see I love the mouth full of tennis balls! My little shy one has turned into a wild and crazy kitty full of love and light! Love it! 
Can just tell by the eyes that she‚Äôs gonna be a nice dog.
i really wanna clip her nails it's driving me nuts
How long in between photos? 

Thanks OP for being a good human
Does she have Boxer in her? She totally looks part Boxer.
Love will do that!
She is incredible)) damn
Omg adorable 
That dog on the right is so happy he doesn't even look like the dog on the left.
This post is a 1 hit wonder
So happy for you! Last year I adopted a black lab/American Bulldog. Adopting a dog changed my life in so many positive ways. You have a lot of fun times ahead. 
That is beautiful! So happy she is with you! 
She's awesome. Congrats 
They are so wonderful. Let me tell u this now. They will be more loyal then ANY person you will ever meet. The connection between dogs and man (humans) is to sur-real it's is different and more close to u them any other relationship beautiful dog hope you and them have wonder life/'s together much love and respect... ps rescues are the best ;)
"We are best friends now" -dog
More like a ballgoof judging from the second picture
Aw. Makes me miss my rescue dog. She was the best. I hope yours is the best, too. 
Keep up on the nail clippings. 
This makes me so happy. I volunteer in an animal shelter and so many dogs are shy and quiet because of how scared they get from all the noise, so they get looked over. This made my day :)
Beautiful looking dog - and kudos for obviously making her feel safe and happy. May I ask - and the vets and dog carers will know much more about this - do you think her nails might need clipping? 
Amazing.  I love hearing about pound adoptions!!
You and your pup are blessed individuals. Thank you so much for brightening my day.
Thank you for adopting!!  She looks like a wondeful pup.  You can tell she has tons of love to give. Congratulations to you both. Xoxoxo
Thank you op the world is a better place because of your actions. Please spoil her as senseless!! We love her 
Looks like one dog stole the others ball
Cute dog, and big props for adopting a dog from the pound. There are many great dogs waiting to be adopted. It's also way cheaper than going out to buy a dog. 
This is incredibly therapeutic to look at. 
Guufbolz
you did a wonderful thing.

I'm so proud of my dad for getting our dog a big "ugly" dog who had given birth a bunch of times and was an old rotweiler and was going to be put down if he didn't take her, she's been a tremendous dog.
Nice
You really did a good first reddit post that it's now featured on the top of reddit.  How do you do that????
Beautiful dog. Will fetch until the cows come home. I'm going Lab and Mastif or Bull.  He is awesome.
Yes, dogs are cute when they have balls in their mouths....that came out wrong, didn't it?
Trop moche le chien 

Needed this, thank you and congratulations! 
It's amazing how a dog comes out if it's shell after they leave the pound. Even now she's probably going to be antsy/anxious but that will settle down. Congrats on the new family member and props for going to the pound to find her!
Nice manicure (:
She looks similar to one of my butt heads. Congrats on rescuing her!
you both are gonna have a wonderful time!!! congrats!  what a sweetie!
Cute pup :)
!Redditsilver
Thank you!!for taking a chance.  She's s beautiful dog and she will make your life very rich!!
This is one of the greatest photos I've ever seen on the internet.(I just commented this same thing on /r/BeforeNAfterAdoption and if I spend too much time there, I'm gonna start commenting this a lot).
That sweet baby! Who would give up that pretty face?! So glad she's home!
Best dog, good dog
She's beautiful. Congratulations 
Looks at this silly floof!
You won the lottery my friend, enjoy!
I want to hug it. Plz give her a hug for me. 
Definitely has some Staffordshire in her! 
What a sweet girl! You're a really good person to give her a home.
Is that a corgidor?? We got a corgidor (corgi/lab) at the humane society about 8 years ago and she's been the BEST dog. Yours looks like mine. Does she have short stumpy legs?

Bambi, our Corgidor https://imgur.com/gallery/v0uJr
Awwww....what a sweetie!!
You better let him sleep with you and give him lots of cuddles and sloppy kisses. Xx
I love her little white sockies.  <3
Thank you for choosing to rescue and saving such a sweetheart! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't think I'll ever be able to not adopt a pit after my pongo.  He's such a sweet heart I can't imagine a better companion.  I'm an adopt a pit for life now.
Cuteness 
Took me way too long to realize this was two photos 
This is a for sure reddit account that was just made after already owning one that was unsuccessful.
First post, front page. So jealous right now. You have more karma with your new account than mine I‚Äôve had for years! Cute dog though, I get it.  I‚Äôll give you an upvote too! 
Tthat‚Äôs funny because your pup has balls in its mouth. 
Thank you for rescuing this loving angel ‚ù§Ô∏è
whats on her back ?
Oh my god she‚Äôs beautiful. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love her!!!
She's the perfect goober. :D 
Aw so sweet!
I would like to give her a hug, please.
What a sweetheart. Heartwarming stuff OP. :)
Omg those eyes on the left! Canttttt deal
400!
Melts my heart 
I'm melting...
She has some real ball handling skills. Good Girl!!!
Dogs are so awesome 
Cutie!! Congrats!!
A lot of dogs will get kennel stress when they are in the pound. It's amazing how different they can be once they are in a loving home!
Holy cow that dog looks so happy in the right hand picture
This cute girl needs a manicure btw :)
Love a dog and they'll love you back. We've messed up their species enough as it is...time to give back to the poor fellas. I'm proud that my state just passed a law requiring pet stores to use rescues and charities instead of puppy mills.
Thank you for adopting! She looks pretty happy. 
Congratulations! Scratch behind his ears for me!
Omgggg my heart! So sweet!
So sweet!!! My piitty boi looks just like her. 
I‚Äôve said it before I‚Äôll say it again.

Rescue dogs are the best dogs.

They want to be loved, and they have so much love to give
How could you say no to those eyes! 
Adorable!
Your dog is melting my heart. I just wanna hug and squeeze her. 
You are the best!
She's the cutest! <3
What a cutie! I would like to get a dog from the pound, but I'd be too afraid to risk it since the animals don't really get screened.
That face. I'm done.
Such a sweetie! Is that a weighted blanket she's wearing? Just curious. 
The eyes say it all, congrats on a beautiful dog!
Yay!
Just look at the love in those eyes, would you. 
She is a beauty !


Naaawwww look at those eyes
Ow ow my heart.She's like a brand new dog. 
All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 confirmed
Damn man. Congrats! I‚Äôve had my rescue for years now and she was the same way. It‚Äôs like she knew I was her new home. Cranberry is my soul pup.
What kind of dog is she?
Thank you for saving her
This is pretty much exactly my dog. I remember walking down that hallway 12 years ago with all the dogs jumping and barking in the cages. Except for one. She sat quietly in the corner, and we almost didn‚Äôt notice her. But once I saw those eyes I knew she was the one. It was quite difficult to get her outside, and we almost went back for another one. But once the doors were open, she was suddenly the most energetic puppy on the planet. It was springtime but there were still a good 4 feet of snow left on the ground, and we had a blast playing with the new dog. I was quite young at the time, but I remember this quite clearly. The dog is still alive:D.

Im probably way too late but incase anyone sees this, have a picture from this summer(last summer?). I didn‚Äôt have a camera when I first got her, but she still acts like a puppy, despite her age.

[imgur link](https://m.imgur.com/a/zCBeq)


Edit: whoops typo in the link it works now I think.
I hope people realize that when you rescue an animal it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve won the lottery.
Hahahaha so cute
Def belongs in the before and after adoption sub. Can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called though...
That difference in the pictures are soooo satisfying, she's showing a totally different side from the first and it's spectacular 
Remember she rescued you!  Good on you!  Rescues give a little extra love.
How hard is it actually to farm Carly's?
"Ha! And you said they wouldn't fit, I am now Queen of this household....and balls"
Love this 
You making me have some feelz
Trim her nails, like yesterday.  
That picture on the left is so heart breaking. I'm happy that you adopted her.üôÇ
My Yorkie hybrid does the same. But it cant fit 2 balls in his mouth yet tries.
The ‚ÄúI have way too many balls than should actually be able to fit in my mouth‚Äù thing is my favorite 
That is so genuinely awesome, and why you adopt don't shop. 
tell her i love her 
ugh, so cute! I'm dying here!
She is beautiful, congratulations on your first dog! 
Our puppy was exactly the same way! I was kinda nervous when we picked her up because she was very timid and shy but after a day she felt comfortable with us and let her silly personality out.  She makes us laugh daily üòÇ 
That's a beautiful boy/girl
She had some gnarly nails at the pound! 
Congradulations
Good on ya for adopting mate, I hope you two make some great memories
More proof of their amazing personalities and instincts. So cute. 
Got the nail clippers? :) Ask a vet to show you how if it will be your first time. 
She‚Äôs awesome!
I love her. 
I loved when my family would get a rescue and they would open up over time.
instantly thought about family guy brian with 3 tennis balls in his mouth looking smug
Look mom I can hold more dan one tenni ball. :P
Seriously never laughed so loud in a long time. Thank you OP for this. 
That's adorable
You‚Äôre a genuine hero, well done! 
Best post to see first thing in the morning üíú
I love this 
I just woke up and thought you had 2 dogs, and that the post was about how the one "out of the fence" doesn't let the one inside play with her ball.

Nice dogs ;) they will learn how to share and love each other.
Oh my heart
This warms my heart!!! She is a gorgeous pup! Her before and after clearly shows how much love you have brought into her world.
Is she wearing a thunder shirt? My labradoodle has terrible separation anxiety and it makes such a difference for her! 
The picture reminds me of our dog.
She is a stray dog from Spain who came to the Netherlands with the help from a foundation called SOS Strays. After we adopted her she stayed away from me and other men as far as possible. Shivering when i came close. Now whenever she feels like it she jumps up the couch and tries to get as many licks to my face as she possibly can.


I'd fall in love with this dog if it looked at me in the way it does in the first pic...
That sweet face!  Thank you for adopting her. More people need to think like you. 
Read that as "shitty little pound"
I just can‚Äôt tell you how happy this makes me. I had to go scratch my own dog‚Äôs ears immediately. This brings back a flood of memories. Thank you for sharing, love her through all the trials and tribulations of new dog ownership, and enjoy going through life now knowing you saved your best friend. 
Thank you
Got balls mate
This picture looks like the dog on the right stole second ball from the dog on the left :D
Aww
Hey check this out!  I can hold 2 balls at once! I'm a good dog.
Congratulations on your new addition!
Oh my heart, the feelings... Give him all the treats please!!
Ahhh,it‚Äôs so touching to see how he‚Äôs changed.
So much loves. 
First pic says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sad, no one loves me or plays with me.‚Äù 2nd pic says, ‚Äú you can throw all these wherever you want and I will bring them all back bc you pets me when I do!‚Äù
Thank you for adpoting,  you are a better human being than I
The difference of living in Hell and living at home.
This post title makes me think this could easily be a front page post guarantee simulator box. It marks off so many front page title cliche boxes!
awwwwwwwwwww what goof!

congrats on your new best friend :)
All dogs go to heaven. Show emotion. The light in their eyes.
That face...
Why are animal shy? Can even animal(mammal) be like this?
AHH Cut those nails!!
I love this
More like big goofballs!
When I get a dog which will be real soon, I can only hope he/she ends up being a big goofball. Goofballs are the best!
What a precious girl! 
It looks a bit shy but so lovely.
Awwwww. That's adorable OP
OP, you are an amazing person. 
Am I the only one that feels the dog has long nails?
She's freaking adorable!!! 

Your first reddit post. I wish i had that much karma. Just impressive.
She's adorable. I'm glad you gave her a home! 
Great job with your first post! 60k upvotes wow! I only got 80 upvotes :/
That is awesome! 
u're way too far down hello
What an incredible photo!  You did good!!!
hahah plot twist! 
She probably feels safe with you if she started acting like that right away. Please keep her safe.
2 balls? Wow
Awwwww good luck! 
Maaan look at the claws on her. I don't own dogs but I always thought they didn't have claws that big. 
Please tell us her name!‚ù§Ô∏è
the life you can bring to one, by making one simple choice sometimes...
This makes me soooo happy. You‚Äôre a great human! 
How sweet. Glad they have a good home with lots of tennis balls. 
Thank you for adopting! The doggy looks so happy now!
Enjoy her! She looks so precious :)
Freedom and Love more productive than
oppression & h8

:) good boy (:
The greatest friend you will ever have!!!!
She has more balls than my dog.  Looks like she's gonna be happy in her new home :) 
omg Nice girl
What a cutie. When you come home does he go nuts?
Looks like the sort who would. 
whats on its back and wrapped around it?
This reminds me of the awesome/sad story about the soldier who was killed in combat that had a dog get adopted that finally put three tennis balls in his mouth. 
Shower her with all the love and tennis balls <3
Thank you GOOD Human for saving such a sweetheart 
This just made my day.  
She. Is. Beautiful
You are very lucky to have her in your life. 
Trim that poor guys' nails!
You are amazing, thanks for making my day better! 
Goofster and gaffster
Aww.... I just Love this cutie pie <3 
Aww :)  you should see if she can do 3 tennis balls!
Dogs are one of the most amazing animals!
congrats!
I LOVE DOGS
All they want is to make you happy. What a beautiful gift you gave. 
Adorable!
Welcome to the dog life! She looks like a good pupper! PS. She needs a nail trim, I recommend getting a Dremel for the job, I got mine specifically for nail trims, everything else it does is just a bonus! She might not like it at first, but no dog likes nail trims anyway, Dremel is much quicker and pain free than clippers so it's best in the long  run.
Aww!!

What is that blue strap she has on? It looks like something cozy
So glad she has a home. 
A picture is worth a thousand words :) 
Oh my god she‚Äôs so cute
Awwwwwww she's so sweet. 
Good luck together!
Cute!!
Animals= karma machines
Hahahhahah!!! Good dog!!
Oh my goodness!!!
You are a hero my friend!
I can't wait to make an animal that sad smile again. My boyfriend and I will be getting a rescue pet soon too
Thank you for rescuing an animal instead of buying a boutique dog! 
Is that a thunder buddy? 
I don't know her, but I love her.
You are a good soul OP. Thanks for bringing that sweet girl home.
What a heart melter! :3
Awww so shy in that first pic, what a sweetie 
Oh my God, that face. Just melted my heart.

Her paws look like socks!
Ah, the good-ol look-how-many-tennis-balls-I-can-put-in-my-mouth-hooman move! A true classic!
Thanks, OP! You're awesome for giving her a home!
Thank You carlyfarmer...you are a life saver. 
Makes my whole day.
He got ALL THE BALLS! 
What breed is she? Or maybe a mutt?

Mutts are the best. 
Awesome transformation and terrific first post, you'll do alright here kid, when in doubt pimp out this cute doggo for Karma :P
Ma heart, ma soul
Thank you for adopting
My sweet guy has the same coat! Thanks for the smiles :)
Good for you! I'm glad to hear that you saw past their shyness and brought them home with you. You have just gained a companion that will be with you for the rest of its life, so treat it with love and respect like it will do for you 
Feeling safe does wonders for all of us! Congrats and enjoy!!
God's gift to mankind, no joke.
There is so much depressing crap in the world that it means a lot to see happy pictures like this on my feed.
Dogs are the best. I couldn't imagine not having a dog in my family. Lots of love. 
My heart has melted. Please help. 
Thank you for rescuing her
Hi there, ya big goofball! 
She‚Äôs beautiful!
So cute!!
This warms my heart first thing in the morning. Thanks OP.
please give the dog a big pet right on the head for me. Please tell him it's from me.
Wishing you many joyous years together! You rock, OP! Get yourself a treat, and one for your goofball as well!
Awe I love you both!!!
Congratulations!! <3 Reminds me of bringing home my Border/Lab 6 years ago! Enjoy your time with your new pup!! 
She looks so miserable trapped in that prison, made me feel awful. At least she's found a good home.
OMG. My heart melted. Sweetest baby!!! 
Omg I love her!
Awww....adorable! 
Why is he restrained above the elbows though? 
Yay! What a lovely fur baby!
Omg she is beautiful!
At first glance I thought you had two dogs and one of them took both of the balls. 
Oh man, that face in the first picture. Thank-you you beautiful, wonderful, human being! 
Friends for life
Awwwwwwwww fucking adorable
That first picture breaks my heart. Glad to see your new pup is doing great! 
Nothing makes me happier than seeing a pound pup being shown there is good in the world.
That first picture is heartbreaking!  Wow! Those puppy eyes!
More pictures please!
AWWW!!!! I just love before and after shots like this!

Thank you for saving the Queen! And even more thanks for giving the Queen proper tributes!!!!

ALL HAIL! (let's hope there's not an "AWW HELL!!")
More pics please!
Thank you for giving this sweet girl a home! And thank you for making my morning <3
Is that a ‚Äúhug‚Äù vest to help with anxiety and such? Do you find it helps? 

#heartbroken to #heartfulloflove ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hey! This puppy needs some bigger balls. These could get into his windpipe and kill him. The Kong x-lrg should be perfect! Then you can say your dog has the biggest balls... Mine does too! 
the transformation caused by love
I'm titling the second photo: "I GOT ONE FOR YOU TOO!"
oh, my heart!  congrats to you both for finding each other!
Look at those big goofball eyes. She smells bamboozles in the works!
woof
Moar ten-eez ballz puleeze!
That first pic... Jesus üò¢
Congratulations!!
Congratulations and thank you so much for getting your dog/friend the right way! 
So precious, I love her adoring eyes, she is showing off her excellent skills.  At last a forever home.  YEAH!!!!!
Shy girlie turned good goofy girlie just add favorite ball-o! 
My feels...
Bless you!!  You‚Äôve got a friend for life. 
Thank you for picking an older pup! It isn't common enough,,,,congratulations she's beautiful!
Be still my heart
Congratulations!!  Looks like he is going to be the best purchase you have ever made.  What a sweet face.  Be good to him and he will be your best friend for his life.  Made my day seeing this...THANK YOU
Is that one of those thunder jackets or is it just a fleece

My dog is terrified of lightning and we got her a thunder jacket which makes her waaayy more calm. It basically squeezes her 
congrats
So adorable you both are really lucky. Enjoy your time together.
I have a little dog that was like this. Been in and out of 5+ different homes and fosters for stupid reasons. When we got her the rescue centre told us that she's not bothered by anything, doesn't want food, doesn't like to play, not interested in toys...  and initially she wasn't interested in any of that. She was slow to change but we've had her 5 months now and she's an unstoppable whirlwind of toys and food and playing and licks and just being a little monster!
got her socks on!
On the left: You can always tell a Milford dog.
Dogs are awe some.
Yeah! I love goofballs! They're the best.
Aww congrats to you!
Before and after photos of dogs coming home from the pound are my favorite.
Love this!

That first photo is heartbreaking. There would be no way I could say no to her I'd have to take her. 

When I finally get my own place I'd love a dog. I hope I get a big house or a farm 'cause if I go to a rescue centre I won't be able to turn any of them away :(

Glad she's found a loving home!
Hey we have [twins!](https://i.imgur.com/W2M3Tl3.jpg)
first congratulations on the new 'fur baby'. The 1st picture is hard to look at, such fear, & anxiety.  the 'new dog' with a happy face and tennis balls seems like a 2nd dog, even if its the 1st dog. Pure amazing what love can do  for a dog. I know, my current rescued dog of 13 yrs old, was a compleat 'wreck' when we brought her home.  Right now, at her age, she is doing her fun thing, a snooze on a dog bed not 6 ft from where I type this. We just back from errands in town, & she had her bag of people beef jerkys, as usual. Good work for you, you both will have a happy lifetime together.
So cute!!! 
Our lil lady was the same way! So somber and serious. After about a week and a half it was a total transformation. She's six but you'd think she was a puppy, happy and playful and bouncing all over the place. We definitely hit the dog jackpot.
Are you in Texas? Cause the buckle on that collar is huge.
She‚Äôs awesome!
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY
Note to self: invest in tennis balls
Aww what a babe. Give her a huge and kiss for me.
What a transformation!
In my case it's the opposite: I buy happy, well-situated dogs, and then I train them to fear me.
Whos a good OP!
What a sweatheart!
Awww I have a rescue and we're working on the shy. We're trying to get her to meet as many people as possible so she can see that people are ok (mostly just introducing her to neighbors). 
Congrats ,its adorable!!! 
Pound pups are the best!
That's a pretty good haul for a first post lol üòâ
Congrats. He looks SO happy to have your love. What a good boy ‚ô°
someone give op gold!! üò≠
I hope you are ambidextrous bc you are gonna have to throw 2 balls at once after looking at those eyes. 

First post 75k upvotes. Ok
This is faker than kim ks ass hello
If you had adopted me from the pound, I would also be putting your fuzzy balls in my mouth OP. 
This made my night üòç! Thank you! 
You take care of her! She deserves all the games of fetch and all the squishy hugs in the world 
Your first post accumulated more upvotes than I would in a life time.
My puppy could be her sister!!! Mine is a blue nose pitt/mastiff mix. Warms my heart that good girls like her get new homes! Cheers mate

BEST SHORT STORY IN PICTURES!
Oh my god what breed? She looks EXACTLY like my dog and we aren't sure if shes an amstaff or a pit bull because all her papers are different.
Is this a split photo or a shy dog hiding from his brother who got all the balls? 
I've been trying for years on reddit and have never even gotten gold. You post once and are the top of r/all. Nice work
I wish I could give this all of the upvotes.

OMG! So adorable! I want to hug her and squeeze her and love her!
thank you for being that G O O D G Y R L E S hero!!!
What kind of collar is that ? Looks like it has some sort of device on it ?

‚ù§Ô∏è
That boofer wants to play 
First reddit post. #1 on reddit. Damn you, overachiever.
Omg
You've made her one of the happiest doggo's on Earth!
We just found out today our 13yo poodle has cancer. Wife and I are heartbroken but viewing your post lifted me up and reminded me life goes on. Good luck to you and your new life buddy. 
AWWWWWW such good doggo!!!! <3<3<3<3
I'm fairly confident my [dog](https://imgur.com/hzFkn8a) is her sister. Washington state by chance?
Accidentally read ‚Äòshy‚Äô as ‚Äòshitty‚Äô turns the whole dam thing around from an Awwwww to Ha that backfired 
The literal puppy eyes on the before picture is KILLING ME!! Congrats and cheers to a new happier life!
B E S T  G I R L E  E V E R ! ! !
Welp, there I go, bawling my mf eyes out, and the sun hasn't even come up yet...

Look at dat happy doggo...üò≠
That is so friggin adorable!
A multi-ball doggo!?

Mine is afraid of tennis balls. :(
Aww the cutest pup! 
Every time I see a rescue post it makes me want to adopt all the dogs but then I remember my other dog is too dog agressive for it and then I get sad.
Right in the feels 
Such a good girl/boy!
‚ù§Ô∏è
I just have to say- SHES ADORABLE holy shit
Labpitt?
Omg I love her 
What a pretty baby !!!!
have 4 dogs ( 2 bully mixes) all are shelter dogs. Good for you!

I'm assuming this is a pit mix.. My female .25 Pitt / .25 Choc. Lab / .50 Border Collie, is a big baby all the time. She even pretends she's terrified of me (or actually is) when my fiance isn't home. However whenever my fiance is home, her protector / savior, she is exactly like your dog here. And she absolutely adores me when Lindsey is home. Goes so far as to climbing onto my lap and jumping up into my arms so I can carry her like a baby.
Dogs are manipulative assholes. My kids brought home a Shepard mix from the pound. Every day they went to visit him he had perfect manners. After they got him home he turned into a sniveling, hole digging, possession chewing maniac. And they still love him, lol! Dogs are dicks.
Whos a good boy? Such a beautiful doggy, congrats on first pound pupp! 
Doggos are the best
She‚Äôs awesome! Dogs know good people and she warmed up to you right away-I wish you a million good Times together-
Aww good pupper
**How to get reddit karma and praise 101:**

1. Get just about any dog. Additional points are awarded if it's from a shelter, handicapped, sad, etc.
2. Take two pictures‚Äîbefore and after you bring it home and feed it.
3. Post them to one of the default subs.
4. Profit.
This makes me so happy
I'm going to say it. Fuck you if you buy a dog instead of picking one up from the pound

Cutie...is that her super pupper power pack on her back? Lol
Everything is fine lovely doggo
OMG WHAT AN ADORABLE PUPPER!!! CONGRATS! 

but don‚Äôt forget to trim those nails! In the long run over grown nails can lead to spine issues as the dog will start to walk funny to avoid pain their paws. 
Doggo:   "Ohfff howff I fflovethfff ballsthfff!!!"
Awwww is that a comfort blanket?? üíïüíïüíïüíï
Looks just like my sister's 13 year old pupper. She will have to be put down soon because she can barely walk without pain. :(
That's so awesome. Tennis balls can be a choking hazard but they have the larger size at pet stores. Enjoy her! 
pet the dogoo for me pls!

Beautiful dog. I think you put her outfit on incorrectly. I believe you should Velcro the strap around her tummy. Arms should be outside of strap. 
I am sure you will bring each other much joy. 
Careful the shy ones are the worst :D
so cute!!! you deserve a boop in the nose, you little pupper <3
Gratz on the turn around. That's a cute pupper.

Definitely post at [r/beforeNAfterAdoption](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeforeNAfterAdoption) We live for this type of story. She was so sad and now she is Queen of the Ball. She looks like she might be a Lab/pit mix which is one of my favorite combinations. 
Trim her damn nails.
