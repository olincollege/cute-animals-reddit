" Ladies, ladies, one at a time! There's plenty of this to go around."
‚ÄúI like pets but I‚Äôm a little overwhelmed.‚Äù

Thank you anonymous stranger for the silver!
I don't know if the Corgi likes it or is uncomfortable but still very adorable 10/10
That's a "be careful what you wish for" illustration.
Doggo is not 100% on this level of attention
*Introvert anxiety intensifies

EDIT:  It's technically social anxiety.  Probably makes the joke less funny, but I'm slightly more enlightened now.  Yay.
Even when you live your dreams, they still aren't quite what you hoped
His eyes are like: ‚Äúgod help me survive this one‚Äù
My MIL has a corgi and he is a complete Ahole. It‚Äôs hard to imagine this is possible without seeing a finger bitten off.
Cheddar, return to my office.
The dog actually looks a little distressed.
As parents of the kids or the dog parent, i wouldve told them to pet the dog one at a time :/ he looked so nervous with his nervous mlems and unsure eyes
The dog looks at the camera and whispers "help me".
she's @madmax_fluffyroad on IG <3
I'm not sure dog is comfortable with this thing.....
He looks very confused
That corgi looks terrified :(
[removed]
He doesn‚Äôt know what he did to deserve so much love and he doesn‚Äôt know how to handle it.
he looks claustrophobic lol
r/thisismylifenow
The dog looks overwhelmed- I feel bad for the doggo-
God even I felt overwhelmed and I was just watching, poor doggo
I can honestly say, this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen a Corgi not-smiling... poor puppy.
Doggo looking kinda stressed.
The licking of the lips and showing whites of their eyes while looking around are stress markers.
That dog looks stressed af. He alerts fear by showing his tongue and keeps looking for help..
Yeah this dog looks very overwhelmed and somewhat nervous...
That dog looks pretty stressed to me üò¨
That dog is thinkin:"Ron,get me the fuck out of here"
I feel this dog‚Äôs anxiety. She definitely looks overwhelmed.
That dog is in a state of stress and is not comfortable.
My blacklab/boxer on the other hand would be drinking this in.  There is no "too much attention" with that dog.
That dog doesn't look very happy. I could be wrong though, I'm no dog expert!
They should have had them take turns, poor thing was overwhelmed
Those "whale eyes" are a classic sign of stress and anxiety in terms of dog body language. Being confined to the backpack also probably isn't helping. Whenever I see my dog give that look when strangers wanna pet him and they're hovering over him or leaning too close to his face I always ask them to give space. He's an incredibly sweet dog and would most likely not bite but just cuz he isn't going to bite them doesn't mean I'm going to let them keep stressing him out when he's given the sign he's had enough
It's like a scene from a zombie movie.
"HOOMAN HOOOMAN' HALP ME HOOMAN"
I don't think the Corgi likes it. I know most dogs hate being touched on the top of their head.
Poor guy is looking a bit overwhelmed.
Dog looks a little spooked, probably overwhelmed lol
"Whoa this is a heckin lot of pets"
This comment will probably be downvoted given Reddit is .... well, Reddit, but that dog is showing classic stress signals. The wide eyes showing greater amounts of white, the constant glancing back to its owner and the movements of its mouth all indicate it is under stress.
Whites of eyes, licking, ears back, etc are all indications of a nervous, uncomfortable dog.

This is not cute ‚òπ
That dog is so uncomfortable, doing nervous licks , ears super back, the owner needs to tell the kids to chill out.
You know you parked too far away when you have to take a bus to your van.
Good boi staying calm. Goodest of Bois
STIMULATION OVERLOAD DOES NOT COMPOOT
Wait a minute, I think I recognize one of them.
"Please God help me"
All those scritches... nearly an overdose!
A hero's job is not always easy...
Poor baby, might get some crowd phobia at this rate lol
I am aware of the effect I have on 4th grade girls.
"I've got more Corgis in my van"
That dog got touched by girls more than I ever did in my life
so cute but that little dude/dudette doesn't seem to be liking all the attention, seconds away from a quick "snap".
Happy but concerned. But happy. But a tad concerned.
Sales of backpacks and corgis increased among Sex offenders
The dog looks like me when surrounde by girls
The doggo looks lowkey terrified
That's Mad Max Fluffy Road
Why can people not learn to read their dogs? This dog is very uncomfortable. The eyes, ears, mlem all say the exact same thing. He‚Äôd very much prefer for it to stop and get some space and quiet! ‚ÄûBut it‚Äôs so cute!‚Äú No it‚Äôs not, if you have a dog please educate yourself about the species.

Edit: edited out a curse word. I just get very upset when I see these kind of videos here. They are living beings who trust us 100%. Show some respect.
Yet when I do that, the police arrest me! Totally unfair bias.
Look on the face

"What the hell is going on here?"  followed by  "Yes ladies I am your ruler."
That dog is not chill with that.  Whale eyes and mouth licking and the way it is moving its head.  Not cool.
That is brilliant.  You don't even need to buy a white van.
Mad max!
This should be in r/watchdogsdieinside !!
He doesn't like it
Bulging eyes and flicking tongue... he doesn‚Äôt look aggressive but he‚Äôs definitely nervous.
Mum - please can I be saved? These children are all lovely I'm sure, but it's all a bit too much!
The dog seems stressed but it's so cute nonetheless
Dog looks stressed
r/corgi
Life as a dog must be so strange sometimes.
Corgi Heaven or Corgi Hell?
Man, this video gave me flashbacks of being a girl guide, going on cookie meets via the subway lol.
[deleted]
Creepiest title ever...but cute dog.
‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt agree on this‚Äù
IS THIS THE CORGI THAT FALLS ASLEEP???  poor thing is knocked down cold sometimes lol
"And there are more corgies in that white van"
This is my life now
Dog looks like he / she  needs an emotional support pet to help with their anxiety.
Best doggo
Dog: here we go again üôÑüòíüòí
Paws start to sweat, he pulls up the google Google search page...‚Äùcan you die from too many pets‚Äù. Enter.
*halp*
Will have to use this trick when I get the.... urge.
"Heck, doin me a concern"
Am like pets but have overwhelms.
The doggo equivalent of a human being smothered by licking puppies.
Dog is thinking that that is a *lot* of 4th graders on a train.
I remember one time, I asked my GF at the time if she wanted to come with me to go on a beer run as I want to get beer and walk my corgi pup at the same time. We get to the store, I grab what I need, and as we make our way out it becomes clear that the local college (like 2 blocks over) is having their undie run. Next thing I know, we're surrounded by a dozen or so very attractive co-eds in just their panties and bras, all wanting to pet and play with my corgi. My GF at the time was NOT amused. But fuck it, I got beer, the puppy got his walk.
I live it when little kids are gentle with animals, usually they are rough with them and don‚Äôt pet them gently and it pisses me off.
This feels like the modern day "free candy" trick
So Reddit just quit life today.we are done here.
This is literally the best thing ever.
Why do i feel that dog face says save me hooman!
Filming a bunch of 4th grade girls in public and posting it on the internet ?????
more effective than candy?
Instagram: madmax\_fluffyroad
this is usually when the dog bites someone... too many hands at one time.
he looks scared a little lol
I guess I‚Äôll have to buy a dog a bring it to the subway üòè
I has a floofer! That is a nervous floof lol
I think that corgi is asking for help
‚ÄúI‚Äôm uncomfortable!‚Äù Ok, I‚Äôm fine. Im fine. A little overwhelmed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm uncomfortable again!‚Äù
Baby isn‚Äôt smiling
^^help.
Lol dogo is not amused
That dog looks so anxious..
Yes pet the overpriced potato
Corgi looks all like "umm, I'm a little concerned here, that's an awful lot 4th graders"
Looks like the dog has anxiety from all those people.
I had a corgi who loved little kids. I‚Äôd take her with me when I would go to pick up my kid from elementary school. She‚Äôd run around and her a bunch of kids into a circle and then run into the middle and flop over for belly rubs. 

Miss that little girl
Username doesn‚Äôt check out
Knowing my corgi she would hate this. If she wants to be pet she will let you know otherwise keep your hands to yourself. If you want to pet the corgi you must bring an treat as offering. I really relate to my dog.
Lol poor thing. When our dog was 6 months I took him in the car to pick up the kids with the window down. 3-4 kids rushed him and started giving him pets. After a few sec he gently moved himself away and sat in my lap
He is OD'ing.
He looks way more cautious than joyful.
<3
I really like how easy it is to tell how a dog is feeling since with most animals you have to learn all these visual cues that the animal is happy or content or upset. Dogs are really easy to pick up on.
The dog has been molested üê∂
To Catch a Predator.
He's gonna have dreams about this later.
And on that fateful day Dr. McBoopsnoot developed his controversial theory of Too Many Pets.
Haha that sweet baby doesnt know what to make of all the pets
I have dogs, I like dogs,  but I am not a dog expert.

Even I can tell that dog is overwhelmed.
That dog be like: "Wow!  All for me?"
That dog looks stressed. It's a good way to get one of those girls bit
This doggo is living the dream.üòÜ
halp!
‚Äúoh, the pets! they‚Äôre coming from everywhere!‚Äù

"... OMG ... they're EVERYWHERE!  Just keep it together ... you can handle this ...."   - dog's inside voice, probably
That dogs living the dream
Girl who tried to pet but ended up only stroking another hand must be upset
Wow! Look at those eyes! So sweet.
"I... I... I think I like this?"
What a well behaved dog. That corgi is not liking that much attention but it's handling it well. No aggressive behavior.
itt ‚Äúdurrrrr ackchually doggo not happy he very anxious‚Äù
watch out for that whale eye
The dog looks like he is getting PTSD from this event
MadMax_FluffyRoad

I love Maxine! <3  Corgies are just too adorable lol.
That one poor girl only got to pet the other girls hand.
Ohnoes! Doggo ODs on pets and scritches! (12/10 would pet)
The Corgi be like "So THIS is what Donna Summer meant when she sang 'I Feel Love' back in '77".
That Corgi is a teensy bit overwhelmed... but at least seems to know that it's friendly attention. :)
I was waiting for someone to comment ‚Äúnot my proudest wank‚Äù
Is he scared?
Dog looks stressed.
that dog would be well within his rights to bite somebody.
That dog looks looks it's freaking out. But what a good pup for handing it so well.
That Corgi looks like he has no idea what's going on, but isn't complaining cause he likes the pets he's getting.
It was this moment. The corgi knew it was a God.
This is not cute. This is fcking stupid, you have a dog that looks to be stuck in a backpack thus has nowhere to go, surrounded by fcking kids touching it. If that dog feels he/she has had enough, it can't walk away and someones hand will be snapped
These little humans doing me a concern.
‚ÄúDad? Dad? Daaaad? HELPPPPP MEEEEEEE!‚Äù
That‚Äôs not Cheddar, that‚Äôs just some common b*tc

edit: common
This is the dog equivalent of porn
Lol, aww that's so cute:) completely overwhelmed by pets though, hah.
"Da fuq U touching me
He looks super uncomfortable.
This is too much aww for me 
Take my ducking upvote
There is something about the title that makes me uneasy here.
I fail to see the "aaw". I'm not saying that this dog will bite... But I am saying that if you want to provoke a dog to bite, putting it in this situation will do the trick. With no chance for the dog to move away, the only way to potentially control the distance to the children is through aggression. It's not fair to any dog to put them in this situation. The facial expression of the dog is making me concerned. I'm wondering what this dog would do if he was free to move around, and what his body language would look like. As a dog behavior consultant I have a selection bias, as I mostly get to meet the dogs that do bite, but man this clip made me anxious.
That dog is in a state of stress and is not comfortable.
Dog looks a little spooked, probably overwhelmed lol
So many pedo's learned a new trick today.
Hehehe, now I know how to attract the children
So much ***LOVE***
Everyone involved looks like they're in heaven..

If theres a dog on the internet, 50% of comments are armchair dog psychiatrists waiting to diagnose, and call the owner an idiot.

Way to stressful for the dog. This can lead to bites.
Poor doggo. :/

Aww poor corgi seems a little bit over stimulated. It looks like he‚Äôs enjoying himself but you can look in his eyes and see that he‚Äôs still not sure about the situation.

Pupper doesn‚Äôt look so sure about all this.  Cute!
He looks like he's intimidated but won't screw up the moment for the lil ladies
Dog looks terrified
I'm picturing his internal monologue with a British accent just totally confused yet pleased.
Don‚Äôt put kids videos on the internet. Especially not without their parent‚Äòs consent. What the fuck, dude? Not cool!
Dog is not happy. Would not let the kids continue petting.
The dog found the love

This dog got the piper perri treatment.

I think the temporary stress the dog is feeling is worth it.  Probably made those girls‚Äô day.  I don‚Äôt think every situation must adapt to the dog.  Sometimes dogs can be service dogs even if they aren‚Äôt service dogs just by being cute and getting showered with affection/pets and making people happy.  As long as this isn‚Äôt it like a daily thing, I‚Äôd be cool with it if it‚Äôs my dog every once in a while.
Everyone is so happy!
Dog is scared shitless
I got the corgi in the back ...
Corgi: I need to take the subway more often!
Dogs are so awesome, but if I ever get sucked into an alternate dimension where 5-6 anthropomorphic puppies did this to me I'd be nopeing out of that train.

Dogs are just better humans then humans are though.
"did I die? Is this heaven?"
Help me says the k9.
Heavennnn I'm in Heaaaveennnn
The poor thing looks so confused
Now time to try university walk B-)
Let me out. Let me ouuuuuuuttttttt...
"Hooman save me"

Pspspsps

Where ya cAt
This is dog heaven
His eyes
Dog looks a little spooked, probably overwhelmed lol
Great b8 pedo
"This is quite overwhelming but please continue"
Not cool.  Doggos need boundaries too.
Can only end in madness
Poor Corgi being swallowed by kids 

You should let him rest and pet him when he wants to 

Just like my cousins corgi/chiahua looking mix he loves Pets but barks at everything that moves but now that hes old and has a infection on his ears he stopped barking and became a happ boi

*They were put there to ease your pain!*

*and get pets from 4th grade giiiiirls*

*If I had my little way*

*I'd pet Corgis everyday*

*heckin cute furballs in the traaaaaain*
See those tongue licks? Dogs nervous and might nip at one of the hands in his face. Owners a bit of an idiot for putting his dog in that situation.
She doesn't look exactly comfortable, though...
You knew about the puppy tax before getting on the train
Corgis are too pure for this world!!!
Today I didn‚Äôt even have to use my bork bork, today was a good day.
I just imagine the dog being like... attention so much attention. OK I don't want this much gash
If I ever get a dog, it‚Äôll be a corgi. If there‚Äôs a cuter race please let me know, i don‚Äôt really know many dog races.
I really think dogs might be the only hope for the human race. They have such a remarkable ability to bring people together, drop their pretenses and show affection. Hell, I have dogs and they motivate me to be a better person.
Those are scared eyes. Having children faces near those are dangerous.
Still not enough attention for a corgi.
The dog is getting molested
He looks a little overwhelmed, but he knows he‚Äôs safe- notice how he‚Äôs exposing his neck for pets and not acting defensive at all.   
  
I imagine he‚Äôs more like ‚Äúwoah... so much pets?! What did I do to deserve this?‚Äù
What a great doggo. All those hands and all those nerves, and still patient and calm. 10/10 would pet just as much as these 4th grade girls.
That dog is not comfortable with this.
I love the random little hand that reaches in for multiple pets but only manages to pet the girls hand below hers several times until she just gives up
Day 35. I can‚Äôt be sure but I think they may be on to me. This may be my final transmission, if I don‚Äôt report for my next scheduled checkin assume the worst.
This reminds of the end to a GoT season when all of the slaves are touching Daenerys.
Ga damn I bet it's freaked out feel bad
*I am the king*
This my people is what a superstar looks like
‚ÄúThis....this is too much love‚Äù
Reminds me of that Tim minchin song where he says something about a puppy in a promise School.
Cant tell if the dog is happy or overwhelmed by all the pets
Somebody tell me the pros and cons of owning a corgi as a dog. I really want one now
I see a good boy
*Confused happiness*
Uhhhh this dog looks seriously stressed
Yall can downvote me all you want but like if I was in the owners shoe I would be a little unconfortable. Maybe its because I hate social interactions but still like letting a bunch of girls scramble around would make me (And my dog) Quite overwealmed.
But when I want a bunch of 4th grade girls to rub me on the freeway I'm the weird one...
Yeah that's not cute the dog is clearly uncomfortable.
[deleted]
Idk why but to me the one on the left looks likea child clone of Sophie Turner
Dat puppy heaven
What a good chilled out doggo! Good girl! üòçüòç
Not cool for the doggo.
The poor corgy
So little girls are attracted to dogs I see. I'll change my strategy and finally start profiting from the slave trade again
This NOT cute. That corgi is stressed to hell and back. And the girls are being rough with her too. But of course when someone gets bit, it'll be the dog's fault
Been spendin' most his life,
livin' in a pedophiles's paradise
That poor doggo looks terrified
He doesn‚Äôt look stressed out
The equivalent of an adult human being smothered by puppies?
he is like, "Is it Christmas already".
The time of his life

The happiest doggo in existence
Cope
Lol a glimpse into doggy heaven
r/babycorgis
I work a dog friendly store so I see quite a few dogs everyday. I have only seen one corgi and it was a service animal.  I would react the same way.
Pets and kids are a good mix! Pets = Calming!!!
> help
Corgi looks mildly concerned
