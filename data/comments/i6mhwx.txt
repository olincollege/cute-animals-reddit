Don't blame moose that grass looks super soft.
My Dad was working in his yard when he heard a young bull moose coming thru the trees. He named him Timmy and he stops by regularly for afternoon snoozes and relaxing.
Moose are so foreign to me, we don’t have anything remotely like them, now I want to see one, live... from a safe distance
To be fair though, that is a really nice garden. Moose knows what's up.
The moose is cool and all, but can you add an album of the lawn/garden
Oof. I’m assuming this is Alaska. Which means your dad knows not to wake a sleeping moose. 😂😂 those fuckers are mean.
I finally accepted the fact that I am not young anymore (37). The first thought I had when seeing this photo was “Damn, his grass looks well-taken care of.”
We were camping in Jasper a couple of years ago and one walked right into the site and laid down in the shadow of a large tree. She was less than 50 feet from all of us, but seemed little concerned with our presence. It was a hot day, and she remained there for over 2 hours without incident. She finally stood up, without any sense of urgency, and nonchalantly walked back into the bush.  They’re beautiful animals.
A møøse once bit my sister.
I'm not sure I've ever seen a live moose
Wow moose look so much larger then I thought, like some mythical looking thing. Would they be larger then a horse?
ALL REPLIES ABOUT MEESE BEING BLOODTHISRTY ANIMALS ARE SPOT ON. 

Ask me about the moose that ran from the shore of an island in Canadia, swimming after me like an Antlered Michael Phelps chasing down a young, stoned and f-word-ing terrified Ryan Lochte (me) paddling his a** off for at the time what was thought to be an exercise in futility. 

Apparently they have a decent sense of smell, excellent hearing and the temper of a nuclear warhead. Oh and they can swim. 

I’ll never whistle and click at Bambi’s methed out uncle again. Nor should you. You’ve been warned.
That yard is so cool
Cool! ... So moose lie down while snoozing. Now I know.
Thats a heckin nice garden
Sam Winchester got drunk and passed out in the lawn again
Your Dad must have been baking muffins.
I started at this pic so long... the garden is so lush and pretty
your dads garden if freaking beautiful. sup timmy
To be faaaaair... It's been like 100 years since I seen grass that soft, or thought about napping in a tick-free patch of it.... Moose got the right idea!
Where's Midge?
Reminds me of the old joke "Where does a moose sleep?...Anywhere it wants"
Has he brought the moose a muffin?
Can't blame him.  That grass looks super soft.
Canada or michigan or alaska
I would love if random  Moose just stopped by and snoozed on my lawn.
Look at those noodly appendages!!! Soo looooong!!!
Someone message Rocky to help bring Bullwinkle home. Because he is not coping with unemployment well again!
That's a big puppy..
That's not your dad's garden any more
A moose of leisure, I see.
It's not even worried about how far away its luggage is.
good lord I knew Moose were big but I didn't know they were *that* big
Pop's has a beautiful yard.
Probably likes laying on that nice plush lawn.
Awww that is adorable!   


I used to present interesting animal stories to a third grade class every week and one of the perennial faves was Buzzwinkle the moose who would get drunk on fermented fruit and wander through Anchorage

He must feel very safe at Dad’s.  It looks like the perfect place to get in a afternoon nap 💤 
It would be hard to pass up shaded 
area,fresh cut grass looks really soft and a sprinkler cooling area off.
Holy crap I thought it was dead I had no idea moose lay down like that.
That's a northern good boiii!
There’s a moose loose aboot this hoose!
I'd take a nap in that grass too.
I would too. That grass looks so fluffy
Yo tell your dad I said he has a really nice garden.
That’s some fine looking grass right there
This is probably the best compliment a Gardener can get!
A moose once bit my sister.
When I was a child, we had a five acre garden up on the mountain. A bull moose pushed the fence over and ate all our potatoes while we shouted at it, unfortunately dad had left the guns locked up. It just ripped the plants from the ground and gobbled the potatoes.
Is your dad a kind woodsmen just waiting for a Disney princess to wander through?!
Y’all think the lawn is amazing but it’s not the grass that’s beautiful. You could put that grass beside a car park and no one would look at it, it’s the garden and forest behind it that’s amazing. The lawn might be a trophy but the forest is the princess holding it.
Moose saw how beautiful the garden was and passed out in disbelief 🤯
[removed]
is that what your dad told you when your moose was belly up in its tank
I'm incredibly jealous!
Your dad's garden looks like a putting green!
Wow. That's new and surprising.
Damn, look at those moose knuckles.
Swamp donkey having a snooze
That's some nice grass
That lush little area is probably heaven for him. You can practically see his moose worries fading away.
Long leg boi
Damn. Those are some long legs.
Mood
Soo rad!!!!
This is exactly the eye bleach I needed after going down a rabbit hole about cases in which babies were decapitated during childbirth.
I read that as mouse before the image loaded and it shocked me
Wow, what a compliment
Tell your dad to slowly gain its trust and bond with it over time until it trusts your dad enough to ride it. Then naturally get some pictures of your dad riding a moose he tamed.
good for him, honestly
He should turn on the sprinkler!😁😁
I always thought that they are like horses so they sleep while standing. I stand corrected apparently moose likes to chill sideways
 I heard they love to be scared while they're sleeping, go try it
That's a good boi meese right there.
ah, the UberEats is here
Legs for _dayyyyyys_
Mmm I bet the grass feels nice and cool
It wants belly rubs. Don't.
That’s the moose’s garden now.
Isn't everyone welcome in gardens?
Lawn flex 100
Ngl garden looks good
#alaskanthings
Just a big boy, taking a nap on the freshly cut grass. I want to be like him, no worries, just taking a nap
“Can’t get to work today boss”

“Why”

“There’s a moose in my driveway”

“See you tomorrow then”
Can we just take a second and admire how green that grass is?
Give a moose a muffin
Moose by the hoose.
Mooset have been a long day
If I was a moose I'd take a nap there too
“Uhh...have you seen a flying squirrel around here?”
Correction: That's the moose's garden
I double dog dare him to tickle it’s belly while while calling him Bullwinkle.
Why dont we call plural moose *meese*?
You sure that moose is alive?
Thought he died
As an Australian, I have no idea why we're the ones who are constantly rumoured to have animals showing up in our backyards (mainly kangaroos) when that literally never happens (not unless you live out in farmland), yet I see photos like this on here all the time. Your backyards seem a whole lot wilder than ours and the idea of an animal this huge showing up in my backyard sounds crazy and somewhat terrifying!
He is watching us.  I hope he is well .
Funny looking horse
You know your dad did a good job mowing the lawn when a moose accepts it as a bed
Does that moose walk thru a patch of indica to get to the lawn?  ‘Cause if you got moose you can grow weed.
Nice lawn!  I recommend you crosspost to r/lawn care
I’m in love with your dads mystical fairy garden
Drop an acorn on its head
Looks like a beautiful place to take a nap. I’d take a blanket and some pillows and have a nap out there too!
Whoa--he must have felt pretty safe there. Plus, soft grass.
I’d want to take a nap on the lush lawn too!
I love how this photo tells a story. Like the abandoned bag and hose suggests dad was outside working and was like “OH OK, A MOOSE. I’M OUT.”
Turn on the sprinkler.....

Dare you.
To be fair, that grass looks amazing to have a nap on.
Its those purple flowers.... god damn moose love purple
that grass would make hank hill shed a single tear of joy
I know they are mean but dang that’s a sweet pic.
I'll tell you the same thing I told my 20 yr old son.
If your ganna sleep here, you gotta pay rent.
Thats a beautiful lawn, hank hill would cry if he saw this
Also, your father, taking the afternoon off from gardening.
Spectacular
Damn. OP's dad gardens. Look at the beauty.
Wow!  Your dad has a moose garden too?!
Is your dad available ?
u sure its hot dead?
Well, that is one big dog. Would hate to have to pick up THAT poop.
bruh he ded
Ohhhh what a darling 💖 no matter how big,  small, strong, weak... it’s always nice to have a nap :) heart full of love
Ugh that is the grass of my dreams. What is your secret?
So, how did your Dad shoo away the moose? Or he didnt?
It’s the moose’s garden now
How often does your dad have to mow this time of year?

20+ hours of sunlight plus damp conditions, right?
Ah yes, F O O D
Your dads garden is amazing. What are the big leaf plants in the back? And the row of purple plants on the right?
Your dog is weird
 Canada 100
Canada
Are you sure it's not drunk? I hope it's drunk and had a wild Saturday night.
How relaxed and at ease does a moose have to be to be to lay down and go to sleep in someone’s backyard? They have reached a real comfort level with the OP’s dad.
Your dad's garden is so beautiful!
Haha. How cute. I have a momma and a baby who hang out around my house
Canada
Love it when animals put there trust into himans, and there able to seek refuge amongst us.
You moost be kidding me
How you be sitting in my garden without paying rent ? (some dads)
Holy sleeping moose
He’s just relaxing okay. Don’t bother the meese
More like AAAA
Canada, im assuming? The grass really is greener on the other side of the Atlantic ocean.
Probably just had lunch there as well.
It’s hot and the moose needs the water it looks like.
Hello, is this in The Kawartha's near Minden?
That grass, I would lay down and nap there

What kind of grass is that? I want it
Pat him on the head
majestic
This is magical! Thank you for sharing!
Prob drunk off bad apples!
Me the moment I walk out of my house
\*Moose's garden
moose are cool af
Glad it’s not dead; it’s the first thing I thought.
That’s gotta feel like a sanctuary for the lad
Yard looks great 👍.  What type of grass is that?
I read Moses and was curious what kind of animal Moses was.
Now that's a nice moose
that garden is what the mooses's idea of paradise. A small oasis away from the woods and twigs
I always forget how Fucking huge they are
I thought it was a dog
From one dad to another... that’s some fantastic grass brother
Moose taking an afternoon snooze in your dad’s garden!
Did he arrive in that pet carrier?
The picture didn’t load at first and I just thought it would be a dog or something, named Moose. Was pleasantly surprised
Moose:  Is this heaven?
For a second I thought that bag was a grass roomba.
Hello there
Can you ask your dad for any lawn maintenance tips??
My dumb-a**: I should go join him.
If I came across a lawn half as beautiful I’d feel obliged as well
I would be so tempted to go pet it or something, but I know that would be a very bad idea lol.  Moose are no joke.
Beautiful yard and moose!😍❤️🥰
Awwwww😍
Ah, just five for minutes. *presses smoose button*
Anyone would sleep on that grass tbh
Have you thought about shitting your pants recently?
What kind of dog is this?
Eaat the mooose
Nice lawn!
How much you wanna bet he wants you to turn on that sprinkler? lol
Gorgeous grass
r/hardcoreaww
moar pics!
There is a moose loose aboot the hose.
Damn I’d be taking a nap in that grass too
Honest question, are moose larger than bison? Are they stronger?
Hi.
Can't blame him. It's a beautiful garden.
well now he cant go to garden unless he wants to get stomped
With a garden like that... Who wouldn't!
The greenery is so aesthetically pleasing. If I were a moose I would 10/10 visit the garden.
That is so cool!!!!!
What a brag you have, My Dad can lawn so soft, even the Moose snooze on the lawn.
Is the sprinkler on? Smart moose!
He's dead.
I mean how could you not? Perfect fluffy grass, nice shade. I’m getting sleepy just by looking at it
Perfect lawn
Moose taking a snooze.
I think there’s a dead moose in your pops yard.
That moose looks super relaxed! No wonder he keeps coming back 💖
For a second I thought that was a car next to it
That’s a really big dog
Hitting deer with a car is bad enough, but a moose would flatten the front end... right?
Imma guess  Canada
Let sleeping moose lie.
Admittedly, that looks like a lovely place for a nap.
I would also take an afternoon nap in his garden
its his garden now
You know a garden is nice when there can be a moose in it and you’re still just checking out the borders.
Where is that?
Moose are actually such scary looking creatures
Lovely yard. Nap worthy!
Cute
Moosen`s tough work.
Grass good enough to sleep on? Idk I will sleep on it
Grass. Nature's carpet
It would be so nice to lay out there and snooze
God I wish that were me
that grass looks super soft, i dont mind to sleep on it
Chilling in a beautiful place.
Excellent photo
Needs banana for scale
Beautiful
Moose in our area are commonly found with Brain worm: 

https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/72211.html
Your garden looks stunning no wonder the moose took a nap there! lol
He’d look better in my freezer...
Bullwinkle!
Oh, to be a moose taking a nap on a soft grass bed...
Nothing wrong with a good siesta.
Your dads grass looks so soft OP I would also lay there
It looks like that moose got laid before the sod did
I would also like to take a nap there
No no, Google! I said I wanted a noose
That Kentucky blue grass makes me want to spread my seed all over that seed!
sorry i was tired
moose looks dead!
No one has noticed the photoshopped Landstrider legs yet
My water bill hurts looking at that grass
“Secret Garden” moose edition.
Any tips for walking in forests with moose?
Imagine being the moose, stumbling around the scraggly woods all day and then finding this slice of paradise. Damn right you’d lie down and take a nap.
There's something wrong with that horse...
MA! MA COME OUTSIDE! THERE'S A F*CKIN' MOOSE OR A BUFFALO OR SOME SHIT!
That’s no moo....   Oh, wait. Nevermind. 🤪
Are you sure he's only sleeping? I really hope so. My love of animals even includes moose.
When I read the title and saw the picture I said, “Aww”.  Don’t blame him one bit looks like a great place for a snooze.  Lovely yard.
Well, I guess the lawn isn’t getting mowed today.
Just another day at Schrute farms
Dude ! Dinner showed up in your back yard!
This pic reminded me of this:

https://youtu.be/PJgSm3xy3LA
Is it just me or does his leg twitch after like 7 seconds
Yard is closed. Dead moose out back shoulda told ya.
dat moose ded
I read the caption before I saw the picture and assumed Moose was your dog's name and boy, was I surprised
Friday Mood
That's some nice grass
Florida too. I needed this afternoon
I’d do moose stuff to sleep as good as that moose.
w8 is he teh notorious appl villain in r backyard
More like an afternoon snack
He should tell that moose to take off eh.
It looks like a beautiful place to take a nap.
Damn ur dad has some grass skills
I thought moose slept standing like horses.....are you sure he’s OK?
That looks relaxing
Sometimes you just gotta find a good spot and take a nap
I always forget how big moose are
Dont lie that’s the loot from the hunt
Yes, I think it’s sod; you can see a cut edge on a piece in the lower tight corner......
Nice knuckle
Is... That how they sleep?

I was under the impression they slept like cows.
r/mooseareliquid
Theres a moose on the loose
Moose are just snorkelers on stilts. Fascinating creatures.
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Who’s a good boi??
Sorry pal, that moose isnt taking a nap.
turn the water on for her. shes hot.
Many moosen
I leave Pro Bow Wow out for him, but he barely touches it. He’s so dainty!
Moose are huge though and super dangerous to be around. My aunt saw a moose in her backyard because she lives in New Hampshire
Bet it’s an amoosing nap
Definitely expected a dog named moose
Nah your dad is gardening in that moose’s sleeping spot
Adorable
Hey moose. Talkin' to you. Get off my lawn.
[Nice.](https://youtu.be/zYt0WbDjJ4E)
morbid plot twist: he killed it and positioned it that way
Usually not a good sign for the moose. I hope it's okay and not sick/injured. :(
Mooses do seem to love sprinklers.
It moose had been a terrifying experience.
That garden 😍😍
Look at the size of his legs!
A nicely groomed patch of grass must be like what we feel when we hit a soft fluffy pillow and nice bedsheets
It’s not your dads garden anymore.
Your dad has his grass game dialed in.
I Moose, I am dad.
Sorry about that bro
2 things:

I think the plural of moose should be meese.

With that said, it trips me out that meese are basically the size of camper vans.

Being from a fairly large city, or at least a highly populated one, the largest animal we see is a pit bull. 😅
Where do you live I want mooseeseses deer are getting mighty boring
Omgosh!
IT’S A TRAP
Where does a moose sleep?

Wherever the hell he wants.
The moose is cool and all but really I just want your dad to design my garden.
And he brought his day pack
I like the Salvia
Is that lavender in the back there, if so I bet the moose got so ofme it before the nap.
And that's when I said "here just keep this hose, its yours now"
A guy could get some good chipping practice done on that grass
Only in Canada
All tuckered out after a long squawk.
I swear these backyards with random animals like moose and bears all look the same
Nice
why did you take a picture of me
Can’t blame it. 

Your dad’s yard game looks strong. 

Nap worthy lawns are next level.
Thats what he told you “ A Nap “
Turns out the moose is fucking dead
10/10 I would nap there
Looks awful cute for something that'll powderize you for looking at it funny
Aww, he moose-t be tired
Future Dad Goals 🥺👉👈
Moose version of r/CosyPlaces? Aaahhhhh . . .
I bet r/Natureisfuckinglit would like this. Beautiful moose and yard!

Viva pinata Canada edition
Damn, now we know where Hank Hill retired.  I tell you what!!
Looks like a good nap spot.
“Looks like we got a free dinner to nite”
I'm more impressed with the lawn lol

\*locks door\*
He ate too much and is an a food coma
Uhhhh, that is amazing.
That is so adorable
Huh... I always imagined they'd sleep standing up like horses.
Beautiful Garden. Well done.
He might just be really hung over.

Moose (meese?) are majestic as fuuuck.
Don’t they sleep standing up ...?
OP you live in Maine?
I want an AMA with your Dad on how he takes care of that lawn! No wonder Timmy comes to nap there, it’s like a 5 star hotel for a moose.
/u/DudeHeadAwesome This place is so magical and beautiful!! Which town is it in? 
*Wishing you all the very best and hope you stay safe during the pandemic*
Is... Is it dead? Poke it to make sure.
Looks dead
God damn those are big ass animals.
That would scare the shit out of me like seeing a bear or cougar in my fucking grass
Big snooze.
Cute
Alaska?
This is adorable and all, but there’d be nothing you could do if this guy just said “I’m not leaving”

No one can challenge the M O O S E
I wish someday i can be as happy as this moose taking a nap in this garden
Good place for a nap. Beautiful moose.
Sorry if you answered already but where is this? Country etc
That is so cool!
Nice
ngl I thought it was dese
If it doesn’t wake up then you get free dinner.
That's how you pass the "Is my yard cozy af" test?
TIMMEHHH
He moose be real tired
Poor guys are gonna be extinct soon
Nice safe backyards must be like a gem to some animals that sleep in them. Must be really cool.
Where?
This moose is my spirit animal
Wow!
So cool! Thanks for sharing!!
Who’s a good boi?  Uh?
OP, are moose friendy?

I like Elk - had that many times.  Is Moose good eating?   I’ve never thought of this until this post.
More like /r/hardcoreaww
That is so cool
With legs like that, draw him like Jack's french girls.
It like this grass a lot
This could also belong in /r/awwdlyterrifying
What do they do with the plants? Seems the garden is healthy. I know at my parents' house the whitetail deer can decimate the plants.
Say whaaaat!?
My dream is a yard like this at my own home, so far just a dream. I would absolutely fall asleep as well. Good choice moose.
That is AWESOME 💚
At first read and glance at the pic, I thought it was a kangaroo named Moose
That garden looks plush. Id be taking a nap midday if i was fell upon a bed like that
Where is this?  PNW/Canada?  The foliage looks beautiful
Beautiful garden! 
Moose definitely adds mojo
I love this, also I have a weird urge to name it Philippe.
Man, I’d take a nap there too! Looks so peaceful!
That. Is. Amazing.
Actually amazing! This would blow my kids minds
That grass tho.
These summer days can get hot, lemme tell ya.
Dead
Probably rem sleeping
Youe dad’s garden is very nice. That must be a lot work.
Monty Python reference.
You can’t blame him what a restful looking garden it’s beautifully designed and maintained
Well dads weed crop is gone this year.
I've never seen a moose lay down and I don't like it.
Thought it died.
That's some wholesome original content, my dude. Now... if you'll excuse me... * yawns * I feel a little...🥱🌱😴
Kids dinner is outside
Australia never has cool animals :(
I imagine Moose are a little different granted their size, but imagine how stressful life is for prey animals! I would be so paranoid lounging anywhere other than my little hole in the earth/tree/what have you
what a creepy looking animal
Is that real grass? Jesus.
He looks sweet too cute
I don't know much, but I know that isn't your dad's garden anymore.
I always forget how big moose are.
I’d nap any day in that backyard 😊
Or, an alternate header: "Moose scales side of planet"
"Yes sir, the grass has been cut.  Would sir like his luncheon served on the silver service today?'
He's dead.
Meanwhile in Canada....
Who is willingly to check if the moose is napping?
Did it bite your sister?
those L E G S
I wish my grass was this green lol
That’s beautiful, she looks so happy.
free super
I would try to hump it.
Free food
For scale, that thing on the right is actually a car
How is this grass so healthy?! Mine looks like it's been through war
Jfc i thought it was a tyranosaur
did he bring his ... doctor bag?
 You sure he’s not dead?
Are

are you sure

that he's

sleeping
Ah, yes. That's a Norwegian Blue. What's wrong with it?
dude submit that grass to r/lawncare
Are u sure he is taking a nap?
Is that a small moose or a big garden?
I’m with the moose (no, not literally)-I would just lie down for a sweet, sweet time of rest.
2020 mood.
Cute!
Your dad has achieved peak dad status. They say that when your yard is nice enough for a moose to take a nap in it you have earned your new balances.
Not to alarm anyone, but I think he might be dead.
This would my favorite day of life!!
I'm sad because my goat just died
Holy shit the long legs
Beautiful garden
The human in me is just going 'Awwww'

The Rural Canadian in me is a bit nervous because it is a big ass Moose Cow that'll fuck you up. 

Now the 'Basically a Canadian Redneck' in me wonders what would happen if the sprinkler were to be turned on...
Big
Moose sees a nice lawn. Moose falls asleep on nice lawn. EZ
Poke it with a stick
TIL moose sleep on their side.
Beautiful garden. This post made me relax and smile.
Cool, I would sneak next to it to give it some food
Please, crosspost this to r/Bigboye!
That moose has good taste.  Picked the perfect bed.  Not too hard, not too soft . . . just right!  :D
At first I was like “aww, their dog “Moose” is taking a nap. 

But then I was like “wait, that’s a freaking moose chilling in the back yard”.
Awww, I would gladly take a nap in that garden!
100% your dads own fault for keeping such luxurious looking grass.
So awesome I’m so many ways, thank you!
Møøse!
That’s a sexy lawn I have to say
That is an amazing grass patch
Look at how long his legs are! Must be a big boy
Nothing like moose mulch to green that lawn up.
What a wonderful creature.
Did you make sure of breathing?
Priceless!
Moose looks like he knocked back a half bottle of Jack
If I was a moose I would definitely sleep in that garden
He do be sleeping tho
WTF?
Who can blame her. Looks super cosy.
That is perfect 10/10 gr ass, edged to perfection
Took me a second to realize you did not mean a dog named Moose.
A moose once bit my sister...
The moose just sees it as it’s natural habitat. Not who owns the land.
I would totally nap in that yard too.
I really need a banana for scale or something I have a feeling that thing is fucking massive but I can't tell
There is a simpsons reference to this.
It always amazes me how long moose legs are.
Those are the moments where I'd gather up some carrots, cabbage, and apples from around the house somewhere and leave it outside for the cutie
Tony Tony Chopper!
I would love to see this in my yard, but sadly we don't have moose here. Yard looks amazing. And if he doesn't eat your garden, that's even better!
That's a beautiful garden
Looks like a great place for a nap
Who wouldn’t nap in that garden
He has a beautiful lawn no wonder the moose fell asleep
I think you'll find the garden belongs to that moose.
Tell your dad great job on the edging!
This garden looks awfully similar to the garden with the bears cubs that played on a trampoline
Now time for a muffin
At first I thought this said mouse and was genuinely confused
Sam Winchester, is that you?
I always wanted to see a moose in person, sadly has not happened yet
It's the edging. Bull moose like really wide trim, if you know what I'm saying.
My grass is so soft. My lawns so soft. I’d probably cut it off, this moose’s so soft. And I go so hard. Bitch I go so hard. -Lil Wayne voice.
Bru that happens to me every day 🇨🇦
That’s so cool.
I see a tool bag and a hose. Sure that moose wasn’t just down for repairs?
Where does a 1000 lb moose sleep? ........
It's cold👍🏻😅
Mang.... I would too, that green looks lush!
I would also like to lie in your dad's garden
What do you do in this situation? Just stay inside until it leaves? I know moose can be super dangerous.
I dunno, somethin about wild animals taking a moment of peace and safety on a human’s property and just being allowed to exist without altercation has a VIBE. The spirits thank you for your kindness. ✨💛🌸
Love all the GREEEN
I am so happy that the Moose feels safe enough to sleep in your Dad's garden. 


It's really nice of your Dad to provide that. 


The Moose must be really tired just to lay down like that. 


Poor ittle thing. I hope he / she is having sweet dreams.
Your dad must be so proud of that grass.
where is it???
I’d feed it and put down some water got to make sure they are well fed
Canada 100
Wow! He's out there with room to spare. Did he bring his own luggage?
Moose is like Fuck yeah a quiet spot
Holy fuck moose are so massive
I take it you’re having Moose for dinner?

This is wonderful - best thing I've seen all day!
I approve
Sam Winchester has chosen your father. You are blessed.
Adorable!   
Bravo to your dad… Beautiful garden!
That yard is immaculate
why not. I would take a nap there too. Beautiful garden.
Is that a baby?
So it’s okay when this moose takes naps in other people’s backyard. But when I do it, it’s somehow illegal? Whatsup with this double standard?
Your dad has a very nice lawn.  I’d take a nap there too.
Sneak up next to it and yell “BOO!”
Green velvet!
That’s just a baby moose. Aww
I thought this was going to be your dad's big or little dog named Moose

I was wrong!
So awesome
A very nice spot for a nap.
I still can't wrap my head around the size of moose, meese, mooses.
Looks like that moose set his laptop bag down after a long day at the office and decided a nap was in order.
Chillin our, maxin, relaxin all cool.
Better napping then eating the garden I suppose.
Those legs are so long!!
NGL, when I read the title, I thought it was going to be a cat or dog named Moose.  Not, y’know, an actual moose. 😳
Should’ve funded the sprinkler on lol
Are you sure it isn’t dead?
I’m shocked that this is how a moose sleeps. I would’ve thought it was dead!
Thats the most Canadian thing ive ever seen.
The length of those legs! Enormous animals.
What do you say to a moose who takes a nap in your backyard?

Have a nice nap!
Cute
It forgot to plug in the charger.
Don't the moose eat the garden.  I have a few deer and they eat everything in my yard.
i thought that thing was a trampoline and was scared
He's dead, Jim.
Somehow I'd still expect my cats to sleep on top of it.
"Garden" instead of "yard"? Isn't that a British thing?
I won't need to hit the grocery store for a while after this
Except the moose is tranq’d and the bag to the right is a med bag. 

See you next week.
it’s hunting time
I like that lawn, nice!
Big girl! (Working on the assumption this is a female due to the lack of antlers.)
Moosin’ is hard work!
So much green. I love it.
I thought moose sleep standing up. Are you sure it’s not dead?
It's their garden now.
I think thats dinner
The moose is on the loose!
whyd I think it was a giant rat
Vermont?
A moose, gonna moose...
