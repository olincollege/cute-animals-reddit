"I should buy a house."
I took our boxer/border collie to the Christmas carols - one and only time she saw a camel. The expression on her face was indescribable. And then she got to see Mary fall off the donkey. I bet she had dreams of that night for years.
We put a Christmas tree for the first time in our husky‚Äôs 9 years of life. She just sits and watches is every night. It‚Äôs one of those pre-lit ones that has RGB patterns. I just have a playlist and a timer set from 5pm-1am and all she wants to do is sit on the couch and take it in. It fits her personality perfectly. She likes to just sit under trees and stair up at the branches anyway. Now she can in AC!
Don‚Äôt forget to take him even after you have kids and he‚Äôs old. Dogs get used to the fun routine stuff we do with them and get depressed when they stop.
Plants are the new Pets, Pets are the new Kids

Great photo. It would make a fine Christmas card.
He definitely enjoys it more than my teenagers do. Sometimes I miss when it was all magical to them. I'll have to consider just getting a dog and taking it to look at the lights with me.
You can see the genuine awe and wonder in the dogs eyes.
Wonder what he‚Äôs thinking.
I thought dogs couldnt see in color
When I was a kid my parents would take us in the car to see lights in different neighborhoods, and we‚Äôd always bring our 2 cats! It made it extra special since we didn‚Äôt usually take them anywhere.
Wow so gray - Dog, probably
Guys. Colorblind does not mean dogs can‚Äôt see any color. They see a spectrum of blue, yellow and grey.
I could have sworn this was a repost from last year, but it turns out you did take him for 3 years in a row to see the Christmas lights! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
My wife and I don‚Äôt have kids yet, so we take ourselves to look at the lights‚Ä¶ and we love it too.
>My wife and I don‚Äôt have kids yet

What do you mean?? I‚Äôm literally looking at him.
Frame that photo it‚Äôs beautiful
This is just an excellent picture, from the look on the dogs face, to the Christmas light reflection. Looks like a calender picture for Christmas.

i loves dogs.....bt i have a cat...hes very cute and angry
Used to do this all the time. Now have child. Better with just dogs.
Now that‚Äôs pretty freaking cute.
He‚Äôs a beautiful boi!!
Last winter was my baby's last. I can't describe how much she meant to me. But she couldn't walk much at the end due to having really advanced DM. But we would take her on car rides that she loved. If she was bored at night she would be grumbly and go towards the side door we only go out of for car rides, so we would give in and take her out of course. She loved it always, but I do think the lights added a little something special. I wish I could take her out for one more drive.
Doggo likes the lights
Please tell me this is your holiday card. That is the most adorable thing I've seen in ages.
What a beautiful face. Wonderfully done pic with the lights reflected on the vehicle!
I wish you guys every happiness!
Omfg your Lil buddy is totes adorbs!
This really brightened my day. Thanks Op.
That is awesome!
This is entirely too precious!  üòç
Looks like a celebrity getting ready to leave the limo! Handsome boy!
I should do this with my girl!
And when you do have kids please don‚Äôt forget about the dog. They aren‚Äôt stand-ins, but children themselves:
Thats a sick photo btw
Best photo of the year!  Well done
100% your Christmas card picture!
May all the dogs of the world have such loving humans as you two.
I needed this! Thanks for sharing ü•∞
I love your kid's glimering, glowy eyes!
He‚Äôs such a handsome boy
I wonder if they make those colorblind glasses for dogs
Aawww‚Ä¶ what a great photo. He looks incredibly sweet.
Your dog seems more mesmerized by the lights than I might be.
The pupper is your kid.
I want this on my wall. Beautiful picture
I would love this
Nice click.
Cool
Cutie
That's the Christmas spirit!!!
Nice
Good Owners.
Those eyes omg! He's loving every second of that!
Once you do have kids, don't stop taking the dog to see the lights.
Solid wax on this car
I love you did this for your fur baby! His face, he is taking it all in. ü§©‚ô•Ô∏è
Hey! I remember your dog from last year :-) except then he was wearing a hat. Glad to see him having fun
The colors, Duke, the colors!
He looks entranced. Animals make the best kids!
I hope when you do have kids you continue to bring him
wdym? that is your child.
My wife and I took our dogs to do this the last Christmas before she passed away. Awesome memory, thank you.

Great photo
Aww I wish my boy wasn‚Äôt so scared of car rides
I thought it read ‚Äòmy wife doesn‚Äôt know I have kids yet so we take our dog out to look at the lights‚Äô
That's a gorgeous picture! Should be your Christmas card!
We love taking our dog out to look at the lights too! He seems to really enjoy it!
Our Golden Retriever loves Candy Cane Lane too
Beautiful picture. What camera did you use?
Family is family.
Haha that‚Äôs one lucky dog!
Dogs>Kids
With a dog that cute, you've got all you need.
This is a great photo.
I am doing this!! This is such a great photo
Him is beautiful! Thank you for being good pet owners.
That's a fuckin beautiful photo.

Handsome guy!

Great photo BTW!
Our pup went to see the Christmas lights too . . She ‚Äòcommented‚Äô on her favorites. üò¨
Aww we take the dogs to see lights too. It‚Äôs fun!
That is awesomeüëèüèª
What a gorgeous picture!
Please keep taking him to see the lights even after you have kids. Please.
Congrats on a wonderfully artistic picture.  It needs framing!
sooooo cutes!!!
Aww ü•∞!  You‚Äôre such nice parents!  Dogs can get bored and need the visual stimulation of seeing new things, just as much as people do.  Happy Holidays! üéÖüèª
Fantastic photo! Great composition.
I don‚Äôt have children and I do this with my two dogs as well‚ù§Ô∏è
Awwwwww!
Beautiful dog ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
That's awesome!  We used to do that with our dog.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the mother fucker that snuck in through the chimney‚Äù
What a great picture.
I love that this dog has no concept or idea of Christmas, and to the dog, this is just a mind-boggling display of illumination for no particular reason.
Aw, this is precious. I have a little beagle mix, I should take her to see the lights.
This is his album cover!
Aaaaaaaw üíïüíïüíï
Christmas Cards 2022. Do it please!
My cousin has a male Pit and she did the same with him üòÇ. He‚Äôs the sweetest little man, and he loves to wear a little Santa hat and go out. I wish I could dress up my Labradane, but she turns crazy with any clothing on her.
Doing this!
Why does it always have to be a pit bull when one of these animal subs is upvoted to the top of /r/all? You people know what you're doing.
dog: cool lights mean treats and toys?
This went WAY better than when we decided to take him out on the Forth of July to show him the fireworks
I love how he looks just as mesmerised as last year‚Äôs photo ü•≤ I hope you and your wife keep up the tradition for many years to come OP!
Black SUV driving around in the middle of the night in the suburbs with a pit Bull staring out the window.
That‚Äôs it! our senior rescue pitties are Riding with this week
Why does it matter if you don't have kids?
I take my dog every year.
I‚Äôm going right now to show my dogs the lights. Why have I never done this before?

Best post of the month
This is just WONDERFUL. 

and you do have a kid! he just wears a lot of fur. :3
What a gorgeous, professional-looking photo!
I love you three so much for this!  Remember to include puppy when the kids do come!  You‚Äôll be great parents!
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
So lovely! Just be sure to take the pupper when you DO have kiddies! üòçüê∂
"What do you think?"   "RUFF!!"  "I dunno, I thought it looked pretty professional to me."
Don't make the mistake of having kids!  You can continue this joy for the rest of your lives.  Doggo deserves all of your attention.
Anyone else read that Children of Men post earlier and pets?
I noticed our new dog was interested in them my old dog couldn‚Äôt give a crap
This is such a beautiful photo of your pooch. Damn.
I‚Äôve been taking my dogs to see Christmas lights for years! I love watching them jump from one side of the car to the other to see the lights on both sides of the street!
There‚Äôs a neighborhood in Jacksonville like this. I used to drive through it
What the dog doing
Great picture
"if only I could see colors."
I love have how we can see the reflection of the lights in the car
Christmas in the Oaks?!?
Goddamn that's a beautiful dog!
Awww ü•∞
This is a photo that will last you a lifetime. One day when our best friends must leave us, it's these kind of photos that can bring alive a beautiful memory.

Your dog is adorable and this photo is amazing.
This is an aesthetically beautiful photo even without all teh cyuteness! Nicely done.
Gary, is that you?
Book the nose boop...the...nose!!!
"How can I bring this Christmas tree back"
My dog loves it too!
Lovely Dog!
Good boy
He IS  a happy happy guy!
We do the same with our cats and they love it!
Now that‚Äôs pretty freaking cute.
Careful, bright lights and laser pointers could make your dog obsessed.
Look at all those grey lights! So pretty!
This is good
Great picture, he looks so awestruck!
I love to see dogs riding in cars!
‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna piss on that tree‚Ä¶ no that tree‚Ä¶ no that tree‚Ä¶ no that tree‚Ä¶‚Äù
How olds your kid? lol
I‚Äôm definitely gonna let [Betty](https://i.imgur.com/kasMYNK.jpg) pee on the seat cover for that.
awesome pic
Oh I'm totally doing this this weekend
üòª
Excellent picture
That‚Äôs a good boy right there looking at the lights
Animals are so innocent that they don't let us feel the absence of our loved ones.
r/accidentalrenaissance
What a beautiful sweetheart , God love her!!‚ù§Ô∏è
wow, look these eyes
Yea he looks thrilled
You clicked this on a phone or a camera?
How sweet!
If only I could trust mine with the windows down. He'd probably jump out and try to eat the lights ü§£
The dog probably appreciates it more than a child would
That is the sweetest thing. He looks excited
He‚Äôs very handsome. I‚Äôve been following this great dog farm in Australia & realise after watching a boxer called bandit how intelligent & fabulous they are. 
It‚Äôs called Doggie Daycare Farm Trips.
That is a great picture
I live in the same city! We really do have some nice lights! üéÅ‚ù§Ô∏è
The eyes of sparkling wonder !
My dog had the same experience lol! The first time he saw the Christmas tree was amazing! He just looked so happy
Have kids, still take the dog. We bring hot chocolate and cookies for the kids and biscuits for the dog. Everyone is happy.
That's so cool, and an awesome tradition you have with your family. Beautiful picture, looks like a great xmas card pic
Thats a really nice pic. Well composed!
This is an amazingly beautiful photo!
He looks like he's having a good time
dog > kids anyday.
Our chihuahua does, but our bigger dog would rather sleep in the car.
I‚Äôm glad to see other people do this.  My wife and I probably are not going to have kids (maybe adoption) so we treat our dog a little more like a kid that some people do. I‚Äôm always afraid of stepping over a line and becoming one of ‚Äúthose people‚Äù that your friends and relatives talk about Behind your back because you treat your dog to much like a child.
That's sweet!
Awesome
Adopt me plz I wanna be taken to see things too
Oh My Goodness- too cute!
Stick with the dog. Kids are a waste nowadays.
Dogs make the best kids.
Awe love it!
This is a quality photo! Maybe post it in r/itookapicture
Never Stop taking him üòÅ. Every part of the family should get to enjoy the wonder
Damn. Look at the wonder in his eyes. I wish I still felt that
RemindMe! 1 year "Make sure pacmaneatsfruit is upholding the yearly car ride to look at lights with dog and take photo for r/aww tradition"
When people asked what I wanted for Christmas I told them things for my dog lol

Or he's like...let me out of the car so I can pee on that bush right fucking now
This is such an awesome picture.

Just walked by my local neighborhood light display with my dogs and they really enjoyed it. My one dog will sit and watch for a few minutes sometimes.
Oh wow look at the different color!
Need no kids when there are Doggos. Don‚Äôt worry. ‚ù§Ô∏è
He‚Äôs a beautiful velvet hippo. Such a sweet face.
You could prolly sell this great pic to Hallmark
My partner and I don't have kids either and we do the same :)
pibbles are honestly just some of the bestest doggos for reals
My little girl loves them to unfortunately we can‚Äôt go to one part of the neighborhood though because one of the houses has a laser display and she will not move if we walk near it she just sits and stares in shock
That's so sweet
In my humble opinion, I think it sounds better if said, ‚Äú my wife and I take our dog out to look at the lights. He absolutely loves it.‚Äù  The three of you are family. When you have kids it will be a bigger family. It‚Äôs obvious to him and you, that you are indeed a pack(family). Merry Christmas ‚ù§Ô∏è
Look at that face ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ my heart is going to explode!
So many variations of grey ‚Ä¶

Aww you should feel no pressure on having kids. Enjoy your lives. They will come
Spoiler alert. Dogs are better than kids. Trust me‚Ä¶
Damn it, now I am missing my pittie and taking him out to see the lights.

"I wish I could see color" - the dog probably
Good dog
Good people
Great photo
Adorable
Why do you need a kid (or dog) to drive around and look at lights?
[removed]
That is a fantastic photo. If that is your original photo, you should look for "photography contests" and stuff like that, especially right before Christmas. I bet this would do great as a greeting card, too. This is a photo that has emotions and a puppy and Christmas, and it's well-executed. Love it!
[removed]
Dog are people too
This is a great picture‚ô•Ô∏è
That's wonderful.  Our dog loves watching construction equipment at work - just like our human kid did when he was little.
Photo of the year right there
More than most kids anyway.
Keep the window half way up, everyone thinks their dog will stay in until they don't.
He looks mesmerized lol
Don‚Äôt have kids. This is way better
Even when you have kids, don‚Äôt stop doing this. I work with dogs and see all too often how discarded they get after the kids arrive. It‚Äôs devastating. Please always include them.
Awwww I should take my velvet hippo out some evening.

ETA: I see you're an Orlando City fan. Columbus Crew  fan here. ü§ù
i love him!!!
This is so sweet!

Great photo!
Your dog is absolutely precious! I would love to squish that face üòç
I hope you still take him too when you have kids!
When you have kids, don't stop doing this :)
This is an absolutely incredible photo.
Good to know I'm not the only one!

We took our dog last year and she could see dogs in other cars and it ended up being two hours of us trying to keep her from barking.  Not fun.
Aw this is so cute! 

I just did a date where we took my dog through a decorated arboretum.  He loved it and so did we!
We do this every Christmas Eve!
LOVE this! üôè
We take our dog out to look at lights too!
Orlando City FC collar. Nice to see another MLS fan.
Now that is one good looking boy. Give him a pet, courtesy of us.
I bet he appreciates it more than a kid would.
Such an aesthetically pleasing photo, goodness
This is some Children of Men type shit right here.
This photo is amazing. I love it.
That's awesome!
Great parenting!
Lol lol lol! Adorable lol
This is awesome. What a pic, and what a cute pup! Have fun!
[removed]
I love this picture! The lights reflected on the car and in the dog's eyes. His rapt expression. Really a great pic!
Man id love to know what he is thinking that us crazy humans are doing with our lives when we put up shiny lights.
I hope you continue to bring him even after you have kids.

Edit: what the hell happened here? I go to bed and wake up with 14 downvotes and a string of removed replies?

This dog probably.

I hope you print this out and frame out!  What a great picture!

I love this so much. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Beautiful doggy we must protect it at all cost.
I love seeing pit haters being removed. Gimmie your sweet downvotes üò©
We have kids and they fight over who gets to have our dog sit on their lap when we look at lights.  I think our dog loves it more than the kids do.
AWWWW
Beautiful..
What a perfect photo!!
OMG I love this so much!  You guys are awesome dog parents!
I think you‚Äôre in the same town as me! those lights are always mesmerizing to see, no matter how many times you see them. Beautiful dog :)
He looks scared out of his mind
r/velvethippos
Aww we just took our cat out to see the lights too. Also, no kids here either.
Aww we just did this tonight as well!
This is adorable
Dogs don‚Äôt see color right?
Weird
I hope I have a dream where I'm that dog.
seeing him look so majestic in the back seat.....

now what you need to do : rent a black limo, dress him up with a bowtie; serve him filet Mignon cut up, and drive him through the Christmas lights
I üíñ this!
What a beautiful dog, gazing at the lights.  And that pic is fantastic.

Looks like the anti pitbull community is mass down voting or some shit
What a perfect picture
What a handsome boy!
You can tell how memorized he is...when you do decide to have children...i can tell they are going to have a great parents :)
I've been doing this with my pittie and she loves it. At the end we go through a stinky Wendy's or BK drive thru and split an order of fries.
My ‚ù§ is melting.
What the dog doing?
There! Take an award lol
He is beautiful and precious and I love him. Please give him some pets and a kiss for me.

I've never seen any dog but pitties so fascinated and curious about human things. None of my dogs have ever watched tv but my friends pitbull will watch avidly.
Your dog is beautiful. Love the pic.
Your dog is absolutely your child

Furrbabies are cuter anyway.
Your dog kinda looks like it‚Äôs seen some shit. Like, lights are cool, but flashbacks are happening.
Bread chain bc your bored
This is what Reddit is for.
So much awe
All the black and white lights.
We used to do that with our pup and he loved it aswell! 


We have a little one now and are completely torn/heartbroken because there doesn't seem to be a way we can have both of them in the car together. He isn't vicious or anything but he is a big dog and very licky and sometimes clumsy. 


I hope your boy/ has the best time and have a bark for my boy!
This is your best life. Nothing will appreciate it more than your dog and certainly won't steal your money for drugs.
This is so wholesome.

Oh my heart! ü•∞

They can't see the colours tho?
Wish I didn't have kids yet.
"If only I had better colour vision".
Seeing this as I‚Äôm trying to rock my baby back to sleep it‚Äôs 4am here
Just make sure you get a harness! Dogs need seatbelts too. I learned the hard way, because of some idiot that stopped short when I wasn‚Äôt even speeding. My dog cracked the whole windshield at 95lbs‚Ä¶he shouldn‚Äôt have been in the front, but I‚Äôm a safe driver‚Ä¶and that does *not* matter, for the sole reason that you can‚Äôt control other people. Same reason I‚Äôll never buy a motorcycle. 

This is the best harness, imo:

I mean, if kids seem like too much of a hassle just keep treating your dog like one. He will love it.
If you can have a dog like this why would you even consider having a kid.
You don't HAVE to have kids! Dogs are better than children really.

And people say they are dangerous. I also have a pitbull and she is my favorite being on this planet
He just wants to poop in the yard under the pretty lights
Dog: looks out the window at something

Human: OMG HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT
This is absurd lmao
And the dog doesn't complain that he is bored. Oh that he wants to use screens ...
Aww sweet doggo
So much cuter then a kid
It's a fucking dog.  They lick their own asses.  It isn't difficult to entertain them.

Future alien historians are going to use this moment to explain why humans are extinct
Don‚Äôt get a kid. It sucks.
Love love love!!
When I see so many comments talking about a dog as if it were a child, I doubt if I'm going crazy or if the world has become an even stranger place.
Don't have kids
Am I the only one that finds the trend of childless couples treating pets like human children weird? I feel like I'm the only one that can't unsee a depressing cope.
Who‚Äôs cutting the damn onions?

Too bad dogs are color blind and predominantly see green and yellow
Too bad he color blind :(

As someone with both kids and dogs, I would strongly encourage you to never have children.

I'll take a dog over a bratty kid any day of the week.  IMO, kids are overrated.
Hahaha this is so absurd. Did you also explain the magic of Christmas and watch movies together and talk about the story with your "child" afterward? 

Dogs aren't children. Stop equating the two

And dogs see in gray tones. This is basically another drive for them, not some grand Christmas tradition
This some Nat Geo award winning shit, homie.
Why in the car, though?
How can you tell? Looks like he's just staring at whatever stimuli is in front of him.

You can say that it's (also) for yourself, self-care is okay too.
We took our dogs to the local Christmas lights parade and held them up so they could watch the floats. They really enjoyed it. By the time it started to get over stimulating for them it was pretty much finished, anyway.
*flashbacks begin*
I love it!
I take my hound and she barks at all the blow-up snowmen. It‚Äôs a hoot.
Lol my gf and I do the same thing
We do the exact same!!
Oh snap your dog collar says orlando lol. Not the same city but it‚Äôs close üòÇ what a coincidence

Nice pic
He's like, wow so many grey color. /s
I used to do that with my Boston terrier, and my kids continued after the kids moved out. . She loved to look at the lights. 

I will take my lab/Pitt this year and see if she likes it. She loves to ride in the car.

Dogs are colorblind. Im colorblind and some of the Christmas lights look pretty gross to me.
They‚Äôre all just the same color lights to him lol
He looks like my cousins dog a bit
Prove it
Awww ... I slept with my dog in my arms last night. When I woke up, my cat was in my arms and the dog was at the end of the bed. 

My wife hates all of it.
Sweet.
So freakin wholesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
Seems legit
Cute pup üê∂
This picture gives a sense of wonder.

The dog's eyes do give off a weird mix of either amazed and/or terrified.  Although I'm sure he loved it without a doubt
Don‚Äôt bother with the kids. Overrated.
This is too wholesome üòç
Quality time is the best time üñ§
