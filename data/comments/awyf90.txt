And you got a picture of the only time the cat used it? Well done OP!
Nightstand needs a little alarm clock set to go off at 2:00am, primo running around and knocking stuff over time
Here's done a good job, the beside table makes it for me though
That’s awesome!
So the night stand is for things the cat can push off, right?

Edit: Gold? Thank you, whoever you are! What do I do with it?
Are you willing to share this husband?
Sometimes this world is a dark and depressing place. Then I find out someone somewhere was diligently building his cat a bedside table and it all seems a bit better. 
Did not realize this would blow up. Thank you so much, kind stranger, for my first ever silver! Here are more pictures of Ollie to be aww'd at ❤️

I have five cats. Does he make bunkbeds?  
Fitted mattress and linen and everything a cat needs! Updoot for the perfect little bedside table.
Priorities. 
So where is the r/Diy thread on how to make it, asking for a friend 
Cat: "This is nice, but I still own the rest of the house as well."
Omg the little bedside table! Amazing :’)
If that were my cat they’d sniff it and never go near it again. 
TIL you can directly plug in your Google home mini to the charger. 
He’s a keeper
It kind of looks like you have a massive cat. More mini furniture! More!
It’s purrfect 
These cats are the best. We have one that looks identical. So sweet and cuddly.
As a straight man-i want to marry this man. 
Husband: "Oh, uh... This is just the scaled down prototype. Yeah that's it."

He even made the cat a perfect night stand to knock things off of.
I did this the easy way for my cat, IKEA sell kids dolls beds for like £8 - 12 I just use that the cat loves it!
Calm down, that's the "practice one".
Is it Ikittea?
OMG the little end table
Gorgeous kitty like that totally deserves his/her own mini bed 
I think he has his priorities straight 💁🏻‍♀️.
Does that black contraption on the wall summon the butler when pawed?
This is why you always measure twice before cutting
😂Priceless.
Need an orange for scale. 
You married well.
Cats are a number one priority. This bed shows it. :)
Incredible detail. If you look closely you can see the condoms in the nightstand.
Now that’s art!
At least he has his priorities straight.
#1 Cat.
#2 Everything else.
The night stand is what makes it for me. I just spent a good five minutes dying over this. I can see my husband doing this. He easily gets side tracked and I wouldn’t even be mad.😂
Do you put small things on the nightstand for the cat to push off
Cool that you managed to snap a picture of the one time the cat will ever choose to lay on it! 
Sooo adorable! ❤️❤️❤️
That kitty is beautiful and he knows it 
Am roommate with a cat owner... cat and I have bonded immensely. This looks relatively simple. Does your husband have carpentry skill or could someone with no experience make something like this? My cat roommate deserves a better bed!
Well, at least he’s got his priorities intact
Don’t know if this has been said yet but...cattress
Perfect project
That's wonderful, esp the nightstand. And the fact that your kitty uses it is phenomenal. 
That night stand! Kitty looks so comfy.
He's a Keeper if there ever was one. <3
This is just perfect.  I love the bed and the side table.   I love your kitty, very beautiful.  
That's so cute! Nicely done!
“6 inches?! I said six FEET!  Oh well, guess the cat will use it.”
Um...What is my cat doing at your house? 
Or you're lying to us and you just have a REALLY large cat
Oh this is adorable 
Is that a lynx point Siamese ?
I see your husband has his priorities straight, shame on you to think the kitty should go without a bed frame, OP. 
100% chance cat will not use, and sleep on your sweater. 
I'm gonna need one in California king size please cause my cat is a mcfatty.
Is that a beret hanging on the wall?  Is your cat French?
I’d have to make the mattress just a box for my cat to even consider it. 
And kitty likes it! Purrfect
Dang it’s cool that your cat actually uses it 
"Day 567. The humans have made a bed for me. I'll assert my dominance by using it once then force them to trade beds with me.   - the cat 
I love that it has a matching bedside table!
No one has commented about this cat’s huge butthole??
Don't stub your toes on that fucking thing.
Does your husband do commissions?
I love this, unfortunately mine cat would just try and eat it. 
The twee little nightstand! I love it!
Omg. That's so adorable. But, does the cat actually sleeps there?
I'm not convinced that isn't a huge cat and a normal sized bed
The bedside table 😂😂

This is so cute. Your husband is a keeper. Men who love animals are gold. 
The black hole of your cats butthole is disturbing.
So it's been 2 hours.  Has the cat abandoned it for a box yet?
I need a man like this xD
Cats would prefer a triangular bed wedged in the corner so that no human's legs would be outside their peripheral vision.  Cats would prefer sturdy wood sides above their heads so that no random mouse, racoon, or possum sneaks in the cat door and climbs up before the cat wakes up.  Cats would also prefer a bed at a higher elevation than that so no random neighborhood bird can fly in the cat door and into that room while the cat happens to be looking down.  Get a dozen more two by fours on the table saw and see if you can build something a little more cat-practical!  Thanks servant ...I mean master!
Lynx Point Siamese has to be my favorite cat breed ever
And the cat actually sleeps in it?
It's not that I was having a bad day, but this has been a mood booster. My "Aww" was instantly activated.
Like the marching nightstand for the catnip.
Damn, cats even got his own Google home!!
LMAO @ TINY TABLE😂😂😂
Night stan, nice touch! Just need a little lamp.
The nightstand 😂
Purrrfect for sleeping.
I bet if you placed a cardboard box next to the bed, your cat would just sleep in the box. Cats are really weird. 
Plz no one show my girlfriend this or my next weekend plans will change real quick..
Holy moly I thought someone posted a picture of our cat on here! Absolutely identical. Almost to a fault. It's creepy. And freaking adorable. I love my buddy. His name is Mocha and he's extremely attached to me. Follows me everywhere and always sleeps on or near me. Man. I love him.

I also love your kitty. Good job! Give him pets for me! 
I would say marry him, but...
Looks better than the classic IKEA cat bed, Duktig (it’s supposed to be a doll bed, but is widely used as a cat bed on the interwebs). Cute! I love the little stool too.
You should make a little light and book for the end table
But did he make him an accompanying tiny alarm clock for that bedside table?
You're telling me that a cat actually used a bed you provided for it, instead of heading to the nearest box? O.o what kind of God is this bed builder?
This is the cutest thing! The little table really does it for me. 
Hierarchy of priorities, from lower to higher: wife, cat, frame.
The nightstand completes it. 
He seems to have his priorities straight
Sounds like us...  We got a new bed frame that replaced our box spring mattress.  We propped it up against the wall with the full intention of having it hauled away at the next trash day.

We kept that box spring propped up for almost 6 months because our cat loved clawing her way up and playing on the top so much.  That was the day we realized we have no free will and it’s all about the cats.
I’m surprised the cat is sitting on it. This defys cat logic. 
The nightstand just murdered me. Send help.
She even has a nightstand.
Good man! I’m going to share this with my husband 
I think you've been replaced. I'm sorry.
I almost thought it said you thought it was for his mistress.
The tiny nightstand is the best part.  
Ummmm I’m willing to pay your husband to make me one for my spoiled brat of a cat
Need to put a bunch of stuff on that table it can knock off
Does the cat still use the bed?
But it was worth
Ted ty if rjddjsnnusjj8wjd83kdjnejejdkdiiridjr8djnjdundjdjxj8esdh7shbdh&-&÷*@^@-^^^-^;♤\♤▪€•■■■£££~£
I love this!!!
IKEA's new cat line of furniture
Important things first
Priorities 
Stunning seal lynx point kitty you have! 
If I made this for my cat she would look at it once and never use it 
Omg !! Cute AF !🤩
gotta stop that tail from touching the lava!
I can’t tell what’s more r/aww that bed or the cat 
practice run
I’m going to need the measurements for this. Does he do commissions? 
So cute...I wish my cat would lie on a little bed like that 
Honestly, I'm gonna probably show my dad this bed, when I ask him to make me a bed for my ball jointed dolls, for a diorama he's building me. (It's gigantic)

It's that awesome that I want one. And I don't even have cats.
Lol the night stand 
Maybe it’s a test run lol. Now that you know he can make a decent cat bed it’s time to get him making one for you. Love the side table lol 
Only thing missing is a stash drawer for the catnip. Well done. 
Omg. That's so adorable. But, does the cat actually sleeps there?
Well that is a gorgeous cat. I'd worry if I were you.
Be glad your cat is even using it
I feel it really needs a rug.  
Can....can he make one for my cat? 😂😂
He is a keeper!!
Gotta start somewhere. Do a good job on a small project gives you confidence to go bigger. 
At least the cats actually using it 
Measure twice cut once. 
Purrfect for my daily cat naps.
You have a very good husband!
Is that a nightlight so the cat can find it's way to the toilet in the dark?  Very thoughtful.
Your husband is welcome at r/catsupremacists
That's some pretty fine craftsmanship.
Your husband is a cool dude. I want this bed for my future cat!
I love the tiny night stand. This is awesome. 
That little bedside table is everything

I'd say this was time well spent by your hubby. ❤️
Your husband is a skilled craftsman! 

May I ask what that black and white object is that's (I think) plugged into the outlet? 
Please put a picture of you and your husband on the bedside table. Maybe in a plastic frame :)
I hope you re-married him right then and there 
That’s adorable. Pls post to r/woodworking (with additional pictures if you have them).
This is exactly the kind of husband I want next, in case I ever get another husband in this lifetime! Lol
If you could add a framed picture on the wall, I think it would finish things of nicely.
That little table tho. 😂😂
Is that a Google home mini plugged in? Spoiled cat!
This is actually just a normal bed with a giant cat on it
My dog's name Is Ollie too! Do you think you would be able to give me the measurements? I think my little pooch would love this!
Adorable. And the nightstand can hold the potted catnip.
Knowing my cat she'd still use my bed or the couch.
I love this!!
Hey bby ;)
YO
I have an identical cat. Her name is Jade and she’s 17.
What colour are your walls? That shade of blue is fantastic! 

Great color matching with the cat 👌
Cool!
[deleted]
I'm surprised the cat actually uses it. Most would prefer a discarded box!
He even has a little google home in there. A purrfect room for him.
Is that cat wearing a bow tie?
Best husband of the year award goes to whoever made this cat bed frame
Man I don't even have a nightstand and this cat does
He had to practice first!
It’s worth it cause that is precious!
Tell him to make an ottoman for that tail!
Should’ve put a cat clock on the table 
That is the cutest thing
What a nice husband you have. 
Love the nightstand ...and the bed!
My old, chubby Calico had a silly habit of laying on the heat vents, in the livingroom floor. As she was chubby, her mass would cover the vent completely and the room would get noticeably chillier. So my father, a talented carpenter and animal lover, made a bed for our cat. It was wood with stiff mesh, and it fit perfectly over the floor vents, leaving 3-4 inches of space between. Old kitty kept her toasty napping spot and our house stayed warm.

I miss that kitty so much. She was awesome. Lived to be 17 or 18.
You should get a pot and grow some cat grass for that side table. It grows super fast and easy, and its healthy for your cats digestion.
Fit for a king!
Pretty kitty, nice bed. What's that thing on your wall?
That’s guy is a keeper. 
That's so perfect!
Maybe it’s just a trial run for a bed frame for your new mattress.
Omg this is so cute hahaha 
Nice place for a catnap. Looks great. I think my two would still steal my bed and force me to sleep on the tiny cat bed...
Priorities first
Swag
Dang he even used the good lumber. No knots in that bed at all
The step!!!!!
Oh my gosh, there's a little nightstand and everything!
Best husband ever
That's a really nice floor too.
That tail!
Hang some cat art around the bed. 
That looks exactly like my cat when she was younger. 
I am salty as hell. This cat has a better setup than I do. 
This almost made me cry :')
You have a good husband!!!
The same thing I'd do for my cat, I would put a mini bar with cat food beside the bed as well.
It’s a good thing you married him, because he’s a keeper
The most impressive part is that the cat's actually on a cat bed
Oh shit, a cat sleeping on a cat bed.

I hate to break it to you, but I think your husband practices voodoo alongside the woodworking...
This looks very similar to our cat. Our cat had a twin, but she went outside and never came home, did you happen to find her in New Mexico? It would be nice to know that her sister found a home with a loving family. 
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PUT HIS FOOD BOWL ON THE BEDSIDE TABLE OMG 
someone has their priorities in the right place!
You have the best husband. He's got a great sense of humour. 
The table though :)
I'm a tough man and that melted my heart!
Wow that cat is straight up majestic.  Is he some kind of pure bred? If not he certainly hit the jackpot on the gene pool
The nightstand is fucking killing me!! 😂😂
Pretty kitty, and that's very important for your time with your husband and you, because the kitty has a bed of it's own. That's a simple and smart thing he did. Anyways thanks and that's my theory.
And with a little nightstand!
Is your husband single?
I'm more interested in the black hole plugged into that outlet.  What is it?
Maybe he was purrfecting it in a smaller scale.
When are you filing the divorce papers?
That's hilarious and adorable!!!
He even made her a bedside table!! That’s the best part of the picture!!
i'm pretty sure one can only upvote such a picture 
i had my cat for 14 years and she looked just like that. she was a lynx point siamese. i’m sure this will get buried but a lot of people don’t know what kind of cat they have so i just thought i’d share. 
I wonder if he set out to make it full size, was off on measurements, and just said F it and made that instead. 
Tell him it’s lovely proof of concept and you can’t wait to see the full scale
GOOD MAN
That's it. You win reddit. I'm getting a fucking cat.
he needed practice before making one for your bed?
Very nice work.  
I built something similar for my dog, but she decided that the my bed is better.  

I was gonna say "marry him!" but you already did, good catch.
And a wee little nightstand!
The cat's bed will soon be the humans. While the cat sleeps on their bed, just how the cat planned 
What’s that plugged into the wall?
Now watch him sleep on the floor.
Hell yeah, what a guy.
That end table though.
What an awesome cat dad your husband is 👍
Like a sir. [u/idontliketobrag](https://www.reddit.com/u/idontliketobrag) [u/julcarls](https://www.reddit.com/u/julcarls)

Needs a glass of water on the end table. Puuurfect. 
Perfect shin-bashing height
Ah so he made it for the cat-tress... 
Need a little cat grass planter for the night stand... 
It needs cardboard sides.
I love that your husband also made a nightstand ♥️
That mans a keeper! Love seeing ppl put effort into somthing silly but built with love. 
Maybe he just got the dimensions wrong?
From the Ikitty collection
Is that cat even real? Never known one to sit on something made for that purpose
*Has no idea what's going on*
Awww. My cat was sleeping on the xmas tree box. Don't even bother buying nice bedss.
Maybe it was a small scale practice for making a big frame.
You've hit gold, id say marry him but you already have.
Is your cat part puma? That's a mountain lion worthy tail!
Happy cat = happy flat. 
That cat looks identical to my cat, Morty. I had to go make sure we still had our cat.
That's one handsome kitty! 
Such a beautiful lynx point. 😍💖
Good job husband!
we call that a "mock up"
I mean, are you disappointed? Cause I wouldn’t be
"OK Google, who is a good kitty?" --that cat, probably
damn i wish i knew how to do shit like this

bed looks great OP :)
Bedside table as well, nice touch 
for some reason, I immediately pictured that sitting over a heater vent.  My cat would have loved it.
Priorities
For some reason the bed and table actually make the Google mini appear smaller.
Only the best for our pets! lol they look so happy, bought my cat a new bed recently. 
maybe a practice run for making sure his joints work like they are supposed. 
With matching table 🤩
And a night stand for some kitty grass to brighten up the room, or perhaps a bowl of some cat nip potpourri! 
Amazing how some cats understand what it's for and use it properly. Some would lay down anywhere but there 
Looks like a comfy cattress.
Look at that nightstand 
Priorities seem to be in order here. Nothing else to see. 
Where’s the lamp for that bitchin side table?
The nightstand though
Awww that's so cute 💓
Love the nightstand
He even has a little table!
He's a keeper.
I don’t understand what the issue is. 
This would look great with a light stain
You should get a couple picture frames and put some family pics up for him on the walll behind his bed :D 
No drawer on the nightstand? Where is he supposed to store the naughty stuff? 
wow... this looks EXACTLY like my cat 
Well I mean it is still a queen sized mattress 😻
Pleas put something on that nightstand so the cat can knock it off. 
That butt tho
Pretty cool but what the fuck does your cat need a nightstand for?
Cat’s like, *Where is the box this came in? I feel exposed.*
My cat would just sleep right next to it.
The side table is killing me.
Does your cat use a bow tie?
I like how there’s a bedside table as well 
OP have your husband mass produce it, I'd buy one.
JUJU! You’re reddit famous! Your cat is a freakin’ cutie, and I like where Chris’s head is haha
I bought my cat a bed a while back. She chose to sleep in the box it came in. 
Cannot be angry at the hubby for this 😺 
Aww that's so adorable, I bet the cat loves it
About time she got her own catress. 
Ouch that cat looks cute... i love it
To be fair, it's a beautiful cat.
 Our Chihuahua has learned to recognize the noise of my wife turning the space heater on. She gets directly in front of it every time. ❤️❤️
I love it! 
This is a dead ringer for my cat..
Your husband is a national treasure 
Hey, where did your cat come from?!?! It looks like I’ve got it’s twin brother and sister! Lol my cats are brother and sister, and your cat looks pretty damn similar to mine!!! 

https://imgur.com/gallery/5waum1E
Love the matching little night table!
I'm glad to see that your husband has his priorities right.  The cat has trained him very well.  :)
Dog!
ummM when me and my fiancee get a mainecoon you already know I'm gonna do this...there is no stopping me

Need Troy Verner for scale and a banana.
He's still sleeping there?
It looks just like my cat!
I love tiny table too
That looks exactly like my cat Peanut
Dat would be me lol
What breed?
My friend from middle school had a small bed for her cat like this and the cat would be tucked it every night BUT only if my friend’s mother had made the bed earlier the cat was so snobbish she wouldn’t touch the bed if it wasn’t perfectly neat
I think we might have the same cat http://imgur.com/gallery/1GHj51T
He died a while ago, and this is the only pic I have of him lol. His name is Miko
AWWWWWWWWW OMG ITS SOOOOO CUTE😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
He said he was making it for cat at the start. Nice try tho
Your husband's quite the catch! 😊
Your hubby’s a keeper.
the real question is, does the cat use it?
Damn this cats got a nicer bed than mine.
Your cat is such a beautiful color, it reminds me of an oreo milkshake lol
He's definitely a keeper. 😻
What kind of cat is that? We've got one that looks incredibly, but it was a rescue cat so we aren't sure what it is and everyone has a different opinion.
You most certainly did not think it was for your new mattress. You just thought it made your title sound better.
Hmm, I don’t know about those joints, hopefully the cat load doesn’t increase to much. /s :P

Also I’m extremely into small cat size furniture thanks to this picture.


It's only right that the ruler of the house gets first dibs on new furniture!
How did you make this???????????? I have a new summer project 😍
That cat is fat
And he did a good job too!
I'm more surprised that your cat's actually using the bed you made him! My cat would ignore the bed for at least a year before using it.
Awwww I want to make a little bed for my kitties 😍
omg i love lynx point sienese cats! 
And after that picture the cat will never use it again.
Bed for the cat, Reddit points for you :)
Good husband
Now you just need a tiny dream catcher
He even made an end table!!! That’s fantastic 
My cat Binx would love that 😍😂
Priorities.
Wait, the cat actually sleeps in the bed? Surprised it isn't trying to go under the bed instead.
What's a good strategy to get a cat to use the bed?
Nice frame
As it should be.
I love the cats little step school so the little guy doesnt feel the need to inconvenience himself😂
Very IKEA.
I love it
I bought one of these from IKEA. my cats love it and scrunch up together on it
r/woodworking
Wow i just realized how long of a tail that cat has!
Aww I want a bed like that for my cat! So he can never sleep on it and laugh at me for spending $ on him.. 
How long will it take before you stub your toe on it op?
r/woodworking
I’m just surprised the car is actually using it. My cats hate anything I give them. 
Super awesome! and adorable!
👍 That’s what I call a keeper. 
The days before children
this kiki is gorgeous 
This made my day! 😍
How big is your cat?
This bed is almost identical in design to the one my husband made for our king sized bed. 😊
This is the cutest thing ever and now I need one too
this. is. excellent. 

&#x200B;
Surprised the cat is willing to lay on the bed, and not wedged under it.
Best cat dad ever! Honestly if I found out he made this for my dog, my husband would be a very happy man. I’d love it if a guy like, loved my dog that much. That’s warm my heart faster than Greek Fire.
and a little quilt with different cat themed fabrics
What a good daddie.
So adorable.  
Looks like my Kitana.
Ill convince him to share your cat... You obviously need some attention... ill make sure you dont complain  no more. 
I was the 23 thousandth updoot!
For split second I thought it was person sized cat.  
How adorable! I love this! Wow our cats could be twins. Mine loves to wear bowties too 😊.
Omg you're cat looks just like my Opal
I must now build her a window bed

http://imgur.com/gallery/B0EBpmH
I'm surprised your cat is actually using it.
Looks so much like my kitty! I think she would love this bed too!
I approve. It is absolutely perfect. 
Does he cat ever hide under it?
This is the cutest damn thing! We made doll beds from cardboard and our cats try to steal them lol.
Jesus he looks exactly like my cat 
Wish I had that kind of time. 
yooo wtf your cat looks identical to mine: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vjAqnaq3M4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vjAqnaq3M4)

I thought that was a little cat nest thermostat. 
my god i thought this was my cat for a second!

On a sidenote, whats that black thing in the wall?

Your cat Ollie looks just like my cat pebbles it’s like I’m looking right at him. Your cat is perfect and I love him like he was my own

Beautiful! He or she looks just like my seal lynx point. So lovely. Your kitty deserves a nice bed. 
one big cat.
😂😂
wow. ollie looks just like my best friend who i lost two years ago. immediate waterworks. i’d love to see more photos. 
What kind of cat is that? Beautiful color 
That's so cool! He even made a nightstand. So perfect!
Does your husband not have a sander?
The small table is hilarious. It needs a little book. Maybe a little miniature *Bird Watcher* magazine.
Excuse me, I apologize.
What kind of cat is this. Looks like a tabby tonkinese 😍
Toxoplasmosis
Your husband is my hero, haha!!
u/altapathy 
I just "lost" a 21 year old Himalayan that got dementia at 19 years and started forgetting where the litter box was. Living in San Diego and not near any major roads he became an outside cat.  He always seemed pissed off his whole life. I'm thinking if he had a bed like that he never ever ever would have laid on it ... damn cat never appreciated anything! Bless his soul. 
Lucky cat sleeping in style.
I thought you blacked out your night light/ air freshener. 
Your lynx point is so beautiful! What's his/her name? I have a lynx point too-- her name is Lily! I'm going to show this bed to my boyfriend as a "hint". ;)

 https://imgur.com/u0ofCdk.jpg
Time well spent.
I approve of this post.
Cats are better anyways so he/she deserves it..
Glad to see he has his priorities straight
unrelated, but your kitty could be my kitty's brother! cat tax: [https://imgur.com/a/TamVI2Y](https://imgur.com/a/TamVI2Y)
I love it!
That is a purrty kitty. Great craftsmanship as well.
OMG I want one for my cats lol! 
DAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I love how the cat instantly knows it's for him
This is a couple that does not want children, but can't help placing those feelings onto their cat...
Ahaha I need this for my kitty! I have an old doll bed in the attic that’s kitten sized, wish I had some space for it in my room for her to lay on it. 
CUTE!
And a tiny nightstand!
Your husband has his priorities in order!
Now all you need is a glass of water on the bed table that the cat can stick its face into and get its face all stretched while delicately lapping up the water it can barely reach. 
What is this? A bed for ants?!?
This is important! And a great job!
Hey your cat looks just like mine! Siamese Lynx-Point?
Yeah there’s no way he’d say that and then make a bed frame for a cat. 
Husband is a jewel 👌🏻
That outlet is really screwing with my perspective of the size of that cat
Can I hire your hubby for my cat ?
Plot twist: Cat still sleeps on the goddamn bed and claws the wife's feet. Cat bed gathers dust.

The feline overlord deserves the best. All hail! But really, nicely done!
This cat’s bed/side table combo is nicer than my own bedroom furniture! 
Pretty baby!  Loooong tail! 
Needs a tail ottoman
So freakin cute!
Cutecat
Marry him again. 
Alles für die Katz'.
Very chic
😂😂lol
Awww

&#x200B;

Good cat dad
I would buy it!
And you never questioned him on the size or style whatsoever until he finished and it was revealed to be for the pet? Amazing!
its to get the cat from putting his butt on his head at night. 
He looks exactly like my little guy. Some kind of Siamese and tabby mix.
He got his priorities right
kitty loves his new bed
This is the cat’s pajamas!
bedside table. he rocks.
make sure to run around like a MAD-PERSON when he/she is day napping. r/pettyrevenge
There needs to be a glass of water on that night stand. 
Good to see he's got his priorities straight. Good man.
Im amazed to see the cat sitting on the targeted bedding item
Why does the cat need a beside table?
That’s adorable. 
nice

&#x200B;
What's that little black round thing plugged into the outlet? 
Dat booty
Fucking right
Priotities
Your cat looks like a cat I had, her name was Sammie 
And the cat knows everything is for cat!
Is that a button to push for more cat food? 
This is what makes the world a better place!
At least its using it. Watching your husband make it then not even using it is such a cat thing to do.
Thanks, I love it. 
That cat is treated better than **most** children. 
I have a great idea for the bedside table. Take a portrait picture of your cat and put it in one of those miniature picture frames and put it on the table. Or.. Take a picture of you and your bf and put that in a mini frame on the table. It'd be perfect! 
The night stand was definitely a nice touch! 
God I need one or two of these so bad. 

Dive-bombs from the headboard and waking up to cat asshole in your mouth is just the *best*
I feel that this was the perfect time to break out twas it just makes the sentence better! 

"Husband said he was going to make a bed frame. I thought it was for our new mattress.... Twas for the the cat" 
“That’s your master project?!?” 😂😂😂
I love this and I'm going to make one right now.
Does he use it though?
haha...did y’all steal my cat he hasn’t been home for a month?anyway what breed of cat is that?
I could not think of a better use of time
And a bedside table too 😂
I just got an idea for my project design class
Has anyone mentioned the Google home mini yet?!  Sorry, not scrolling through every post
Need a lamp and a little dish of catnip on the nightstand! 🤣 I love it! 😹
Just needs a little picture above the bed now. 
Best husband ever 
He's a winner 
OMG the nightstand, and the perfectly arranged bedlinens with the topsheet tucked in *just so,* I'm dying.

Also, such a beautiful cat!
RIP cat 😢
With a side table?! Nice
The color of your bedroom is gorgeous 😱 The cat is nice too ❤️
Gorgeous kitty
We've got a Norwegian Snow Shoe.... great cats and very smart. To smart. And spoiled, and bossy....Chubbs, be quite, daddy is busy talking on reddit. 
Such a pretty cat 
/u/cetsnorewoo gonna need king size for bobo
Hmmm, maybe I should consider getting myself a husband after all...
Get yourself a man that treats your animals before he treats himself lol 👍🏻 thumbs up to this dude
Is that a Google Home he's got? Wow. 
Poplar 1 inch dowels, a 1x4, and some poplar plywood?

Or birch?
What breed is this? My cat looks exactly the same. 
Build this cat a whole damn house! 
I love your husband
Adorable! I'd make one for my rats, but they'd just chew it up 😭
what breed? 
Is he a tabby Siamese mix? I have a couple. About to turn two years old.

Happy cat, happy life. - Cat
When you found out it was for the cat, did you get angry at your husband?
Now I want my husband to make one for our cats 😁
A bed frame, for the catress. Neat.
This is dope
true love lol
Haha, I really want to know how this cat should use this small stool.
That man is a keeper! 
He's a keeper.
Awesome husband
That's fucking adorable 
I have your cat's twin!! 
At least the cat is actually using it! 😂
nice
The man has his priorities straight
love the little matching nightstand
Well the caption was just enough for me 😆😆😆
What is that black dot in the outlet?
This is incredible, and the side table is a nice touch! Does your cat have his/her own instagram?!
Furniture salesmen used to carry miniatures as the traveled by train. Maybe your husband just wanted to show you the bed that is in your future. 
That's actually pretty cool 
A cat actually using something intended for cats, and not just a random box lying around. I'm having a hard time believing this one.
So sweet! I wish my Husband did things like that for our cats!
Spoiler alert! He loves the cat more than you.
[removed]
Nice bed. Cat has his/her own little bedroom. Too cute.
That's funny

Ohhh yeaaa
That's a good good hubby lol
I wish I was treated like that 
It’s about time 
He’s a keeper.
And a little bedside table! 😍
Furry boys
Meanwhile, I sleep on the floor
Cats do not abide top sheets
Okay, now this is epic 
Never let him go
Holy fucking shit... that looks EXACTLY like my cat. 
The nightstand kills me, does he need an apple charger?
Lol a stool and a night light too.
Lol🤣😂
Lynx  Point Siamese if you please
Aww
and that is what you call LOVE!  Now, he just needs to a put a cup full of catnip on that night table. :)   BTW, awesome looking bed.
He even made a night stand 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I really want to pet the cat
Priorities..... this husband has them. 
Your husband is a great man.
Husband is amazing. He should totally turn this into a side gig on Etsy. I’d buy! My cats *need* these. 
You knew what he was doing...
Do you have any blue print plans for this project? I'm new to woodshop and would appreciate the help in replicating this.
Love it!!! Adorable bed and side table! 
Practice makes purrfect
he's a keeper
😂
me when i get a cat 🤧
What is this a bed for Ants???
Good husband 
Is that a Google assistant in the wall plug? That's like genius...
I prefer the one from ikea!
That's adorable!
The night table though!!
What's the black round thing there?
wow!awesome
Priorities right there
nicely made. 
What is that plugged I'm on the wall to the left of the bed? I'm assuming it's a smart device but I.can't tell what it is. 
Truly, it’s what he deserves 😸
Lynx Point siamese?
Omg, the night stand! I'm dead.
With a side table no less!!! 😂😂😂😂
What's plugged into your wall?
What is in the outlet a night-light or a google home?   
This feline makes the rest look like prehistoric.  

It's hard to be mad when it's so darn cute and well made!
awww
I need dimensions and instructions, I have a lot of lesbian friends and I'm planning a party
My kinda guy! 
That bedside table though
He's a keeper
You should put a catnip plant on the bedside table. 
A bed fram i would like to build one.
And look at that little table.
Some art to go above the bed would be insane 
Ser Pounce is pleased
Outstanding move
Sooo.. no kids?
The side table tho 
Cat looks happy 
Cat even gets its own Google mini, noice
Proof-of-concept/practice run


One hopes
The cat needs some framed art or photos of you.
Aww and he has a Google home mini he can speak to, too. Lucky cat
the cat is the king of the house
That cat looks unbelievably soft. Plz pet her for me
Maybe he is just practicing 
The night stand is what really takes this to the next level
That nightstand though lol
That lil coffee table. So cute!
Awww, he even made him a nightstand. 
Priority in homes:

1) dog
2) cat
3) any other pet
4) spouses 

😂🤣
Husband goals 
This is so cute 😽🐱🐾🐾 though !  

He has his own personal Rm, personal bed 🛏 
and a small step on the right of the Bed .🛏 

How cute is That ! 🐾🐾
I  LOVE it!!! Great job. I need 5 please.  My cats time share something's, boxes, human laps, but they'd fight over this...
Does this cat have it's own Google Home mini? Lol
I made one for my baby neko, I forgot the little neko's name. 
Priorities. 
And a tiny night table to go with it! So presh
Looks just like the cat I had but someone cat napped him 
I love the side table!  
I'd also accept a photo of a bed framed on the wall. 
Adorable!
Marry him
It's awesome it looks like it's store bought tho. It's not even sanded down nor does it has anything to protect the wood.
