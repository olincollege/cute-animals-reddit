"One of us tells only truths, and so does the other, because we are good boys"
We would be happy to retrieve your information.
I like to think the dogs have over run the pound and are now holding the humans in the cages
hello, this is dog.  here us your room key, sir.  breakfast is at 9am and no pets are permitted.  ty and have nice stay.
This is just like my Reddit dream. Open up the comments and see two goldens waiting for me. 

Edit: [You guys are the best.](https://m.popkey.co/7768f1/pkZqv.gif)

"Welcome to good boys, i love you"
This reminds me of the hallway scene in The Shining for some reason
Dr Dog well see you now
Did she miss the door handle at first?
Welcome to the lab.
Welcome to Good Boys, home of the good boys. May I take your order?
GOLDENS ARE THE BEST 
Hi!  I'm just here to get my Lab results 
What an odd way to open the door
Mr. PeanutButter and his brother! Yes.
[deleted]
the one on the left is totally saying, "Yesh, how may us do stuffs?" 
Employees of the month every month.
Who's the hot blonde on reception? 
"Just a minute sir, let me... RETRIEVE your records. Har!"
The failed door open attempt made me feel so cringy. Only because I've done stuff like that while trying to record a video.
Unless you have a phobia of dogs!
Hai doggy
Welcome to Good Boys, how may I borksist you?
Please fill out the new client forms again.  
I ate the first ones. 
she missed the door handle when she first tried to open it. 
Eyes following the treat hand and that sniff scent check if payment has been brought. Classic Goldens
"Welcome to Doggie Cookiez Inc!We're...sold out today.  Yeah, that's it. Come back tomorrow."
Until, y'know, you need something actually done.
"Come play with us hooman, forever and ever and ever."
If I walk into a building and two dogs greet me with a "good morning sir, how can I help you?" I'm leaving that building. 
We are just waiting on your lab results. Let me go retrieve them for you. 
"I WANT TO SPEAK TO YO-oh hello there friends! Who wants a belly rub?!"
/r/Dogswithjobs 
Two smiling pretty blondes, lovely greeting, useless at paperwork.
Smiles, eye contact, and neither one of them was on their phones.  Definitely not human.
hemlo wut can us gud boyes do fur u today???
Just another day at the Arf-ice.
We are currently looking at hiring some new receptionists at my work, and I think these two will be pawfectly qualified for the job. 
Heaven's reception 
I bet they steal the rubber bands from storage and make balls out of them. 

*filthy mutts*
10/10. Would take my business here. 
The golden standard of customer service. 
Patty and Selma
Who's that dog?
Before she even opened the door I was like, it's gonna be dogs. 
Finally, a retail worker you can always expect to be a good boy!
This is the best kind of alternate reality.
>"I'd like to return this tennis ball I bought yesterday."

"Good human."
May I help roo?
Let me bone u :)
*goodest
Revised stereotypical dog meme:

*"We have a fairly good idea what we're doing!"*
Lol it's dogs instead of people!
Have you scheduled an apawntment with us ma'am?
I was really confused by the man's hand and the woman's reflection.
"You're my favourite customer"

"Hi doggy"
woof can I do for you?
There paws are conjoined. 
Good boy Inc. How may I help you?
Those are some GOOD BOYS
"What the fuck do YOU want?"
So that's why they never pick up.
They both licked the receptionist to death. OP was the next target but somehow she survived the incident and posted it online for evidence purpose.
I trust them, they're lab assistants.
It annoys me an unnecessarily large amount that they missed the door handle at first
I like how the leash looks like a tie
Sir, we need to lick you to verify your ID 
woof can we do for you today?
/u/kylesenpapi
They're holding fucking hands too omg
Blonde secretaries. How stereotypical.
Who's a good receptionist...
Hai Doggy
"Just a minute sir, let me... RETRIEVE your records. Har!"

That's golden...
Lol this post is about to get archived. Hello future redditers!

Hi mom!
Here's my money. 
Hello sir. Let me guess. You have fleas...
Lefty must be a flight risk.
*"Hi, we're uh.... two golden retrievers.."*

(Awkward Silence)

*"I don't know what more you want,"*

(....)

"*Would you like a bowl of Mi... Glass of Milk?*"
"Howl can we help you?"
"Hello! The dogtor will see you now!"
looks like a ruff case of the mondays
this place is ran by good boys i can tell!
If it was the best customer service, i believe there would a golden holding the door for you
This gave me a smile almost as big as theirs.
Is this an animal clinic? 
That customer service is the gold standard.
Getting a new roof?
Two blondes at the front desk is always a winner. 
AI is killing our job
They're such professional puppers!
Thought to myself, "it's definitely gonna be a dog." Was pleasantly surprised. 
I feel like the one on the right is thinking "how long do we have to hold this for her".
We would like to welcome you. The entry fee is 2 schmackos.  
What paw-fict workers 
"I'm sorry ma'am, we don't accept check, credit or cash. Only doggo treats."
"I woof working here"
Double dog dare you to say anything about the service.
Can we get a subreddit for customer service animals? 
Hello, this is DogCo
"Uh, what's with the camera lady?"
another twenty seconds of footage and all I hear "Their eating me"
From the thumbnail, it looks like he's grabbing a piece of poo from the window. 

Glad I was wrong this time! 
They seemed very pawlite
I hope their job isn't too... ruff. 
"Come Play with us"
I hope someday, just for a day Reddit gets completely overtaken by goldens. I mean not that they operate or use it but like all of the subs have a golden retriever in a post that makes the front page. A truly Golden Day. All hail goldens. 
They look like they are trying to smile so hard... so cute
Service with a smile!
Is this at a realty office? Those dogs look familiar.
Where is this? I want to visit!
Whatever this business is, I need to partake of it's services!
I fucking love dogs 
You're not suppose to jump over the other side of the counter....but I wanna play 
rated two paws up
They look so happy to help! 
"Yeah Dad, you told us!"
Hi I'm looking for the ball my owner threw which seems to have never landed.
Love the renovations at the gate of heaven, very modern. 
Good Boys Inc.
This office looks familiar..
This really needs to be made into one of those comics that tells a story with a gif attached.
Heckin slow day. Ruff.
Anyone else noticed how unusually close the counter is to the entrance?
"how may we bork you?"
let me get the branch manager...
I was confused as shit as to how some random girl standing outside would be related to the customer service and when you opened the door my mind was mildly blown for a hot second 
When I opened this I was like I hope there's a dog. And there ended up being two dogs. Best surprise ever
Haha I can tell you have treats! That is the same look my dog has when I open the package of ham
Those are some big chains. 
It will be my favorite store, lol😁
As a customer service agent, I was expecting this post to be an appreciation of good work; an affirmation that when I go the extra mile, there are actually people out there who pay attention and are thankful for it. 

Turns out, Reddit just wishes that I was replaced with animals. I'm not sure why I expected otherwise. 
/u/asunk
Reminds me of AVS in Orlando.
Schiz Guy: "Hi, is the doctor in? Recently I've been seeing things and I think I might have Schizophrenia, like right now my mind thinks you're a dog."
Dog 1: "Woof!"
Schiz Guy: "Ah, O.K, so right now either you're actually a dog or my mind just replaced whatever you said with a dog barking."
Dog 1: "Woof!"
"Alright...how about you, are you a dog?"
Dog 2: "Woof! Woof! Woof!"
Schiz Guy: "I'll just come again some other time..."
Nothing bad ever happens on the Labrador Peninsula
This is the only customer service. Everything else is inadequate 
omg THE BEST GREETING EVER
That will be 20 good boys, 15 belly rubs, and 12 ear scritches per ear.
Sorry to tell the world this, but golden retrievers and labs, popular as the may be, are not cute, adorable, or awww. They are overrated. The Katy Perrys of dogs, if you will.
"What can I dog for you ?"
I initially didn't cotton on to it being a mirror. Felt slightly mindfucked.
only two types of people who know what the best dog is...

Those who have had a golden...  
Yes! Dogs with jobs!
A pair of blonde receptionists, my favourite. 
Could I retrieve your file?
They should do this at a Pot dispensary so people think they are tripping out
Sons of bitches....
>My assistant is a golden retriever. Adorable, but dim. Her whole keyboard is just three big buttons.
"Welcome to the office, home of the office. Can I have a ball?"
I always prefer Mom and Pawp establishments
Wow idk what is about goldens but they just always make me so happy
I thought she was opening the door for someone outside at first
Service with a smile.
Looks like they are about to talk
I swear you were going outside and letting someone in.
I like his tie.
thats cute
:) :) :) :| :) :) :| :) :)
Double Trouble!!! My heart ❤️ 
Yo dog ... we heard you like dogs at desks ...
They're just enjoying national dog day! 
"Alright ma'am let's get on with it. We close in 15 minutes and it's been a ruff day."
Just great. Another customer service rep that can't speak English. 
reminds me of the shibe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6CcUj2mDbI
Oh they have those troublesome twins running the counter again I see.
Ruff day at the office? 
[deleted]
The golden standard 
They dont get shit done but they so nice its hard to complain
Hehehe good doggies 🐶🐶🤗
Gotta give 'me credit for smiling all the time. Their jobs are "ruff" business! 
I love how happy goldens always are just to be involved.  Not a clue what is going on, just that they are part of it, so hapiness!
The dog on the left doesn't know whether to bark or stay silent 
Hello how may we bork you
not bad for your first time opening a door
I love how he goes in and the golden retrievers are like 'wassup'?
Leggy blonde twins 
suddenly r/bojackhorseman
Zootopia predicted this.
Please leave a good boy tip
I fuckin love dogs! As I grow older the more I love them. 
With such personnel I would lead all the day long
I think my heart just melted
Way better than ufcfightpass customer service. 
But they're helping people about what ?
Herro! Howr mayr ri rerlp ru?
"Just wanted to pop in real quick to see who's a good boy. Either of you? No? Ok, I must have the wrong office."
Best dogs ever, better than anyone’s service 

Heavens to betsy, am I in heaven?
Welcome to "insert business", would you be interested in scratching our heads?

Real world translation: woof
Best team of psychologists in town! 

They treat depression, loneliness,  anxiety, stress, panic attacks, addiction, etc.

"Welcome to the law offices of Goodboy and Goodboy.
You can just see the one on the left holding those barks back 
They forgot to put on their human disguises today
Not one, but fucking two! 12/10 would visit. 
I would make a gold joke since you got some but I can't think of one :(
"Is this the Krusty Krab?"
"No, this is dog"
What? You didn't give them a head scratch or a treat? Horrible human. 
Seriously all the complaints departments should be run by doggos. Whatever the problems that might end your world would disappear when you lay your eyes on these cute receptionists.
This feels like the beginning to an amazing FMV game.
What are you talking about? Their service is appawlling!
Yes we do accept Visa, Mastercard and belly rubs as payment.
Welcome to the firm of pupper and pupper. 
Even dogs can smile better than me
I wish I could upvote more than once! 
I was going to dispute the title because those dogs probably couldn't use that computer. Then I remembered actual customer service. *shivers*
Turns out this is actually just a leaked clip from the new Bojack horseman season.
I got a bone to pick with u.....awwww nevermind
I always feel more comfortable when the employees are on a leash
I like how the girl recording the vid missed the pull plate because she forgot about the camera's delay and depth perception 
Alexis?
Doge Mifflin, this is puppers.
Wonder how long it took for u to set that up. 
Loving this
They're doing so well

I'm sure one would get about the same amount of satisfying replies from these dogs than a human customer service.

As an owner of A Husky named Loki (he's earned that name) and other Huskies and a Malamute in the past . With them this would not happen. Calmness is not really their style.
Yeah, wish my gf had a reflection like that too.
I need to know who's a good doggie?
Would be better if they leaped over the counter to lick her with appreciation for her buisness
The only bitches I wanna deal with at the front desk

Cool! Twins.

Because service is selling and selling is service. 
They're just wondering if she's their 1'oclock walk appointment.
Better than Ubisoft.
Hi would you like a treat? On us. I mean for us.. 
Me- I'd like to close out my bank account. 

Dog- you'd like us to retrieve your money?

Me- ah, sure. 

Dog- ... Woof. 

Me- ... ah, my money please?

Dog- Woof?

Me- Why are you barking as a question? 

Dog- woof!

Me- ... ok, i see what you did. 

Dog- Look, guy, I'm a dog. The people who work here are having sex in the back. 

Me- oh. I guess I'll wait?

Dog- it might take a while

Me- why is that?

Dog- they are doing it 'doggy style'

Me-... how are you speaking to me?

Dog- ... woof. 

...

Dog- just kidding. You had a stroke. You are dying right now. 

Me- oh shit... 

...

Me- um, can I get all my money out?

My best friend told me he'd slept with the twins on reception at his work, so I went to check them out. Awkward.
What good boys!
*Oh, uh… I don't wanna file a complaint anymore.*

Woof woof,woof woof. Woof woof woof woof woof? Woof.

Never heard "heckin help" before and I'm from Alabama.  Must be real adverse to profanity lol
"Hello, I'm looking for some information. Whose a good boy?"
This woulda been perfected if the human hand shook a dog hand 
We don't deserve them )':
What will happen when companies realise that they can hire employees that get paid in pats, scritches, and treats. We will have alot of good boys in the world, and frankly ill give up my job for that.
TWINS!!!
Hello I'm from Health and Safety, I understand they've been working you like dogs here.
Twins, Basil!
Nothing says customer service like a couple of dumb blondes 
They look like they being forced
Oh no, those pooches are gonna get hip dysplasia!!! Someone help those pooches
Totally unexpected, one of a kind.
It looks like the one  on the left is supervising the other, like he/she is a trainee 😄
ohhhh this made my day :)
Missing the door handle first time around made me smile
"Hello sir, can we help you?"
This is a great idea
Can't wait to see this on Facebook next week.
I so want to see some voiceovers with this!!!
Woof morning, how may we help you? 
Are we just going to ignore the logging chain - on a golden retriever? He must be one vicious beast! 
If there was a third dog you'd be standing at the gates of hell. Cerberus is a good boys
Pretty sure the one on my left asks the patient if they have an appointment

I think Goldens are kinda bad at customer service, they mean well but they are just so stupid.
u/twiddles20
Am I the only one who  hates the fact she scoops the door with TWO FUCKING FINGERS when she could have easily used her whole hand. 
not gonna lie, you fucking suck at opening doors. Luckily it's not a super important skill so you'll still do fine in life. Just saying though.
Blonde twins, I'm in!
Puppy~~ <3 "Yes sir, I would like to file a complaint."
Twin Furries. 
Her arm looks like a turd in the reflection of the door
"Row can re relp too"
If only life was like this
I'd bring treats and leave a 5 star review on yelp  
i like how you couldnt grab the door kinda
Ofcourse, on top some idiotic cutsy gif with pets. Why is reddit infested by brain dead idiots? Please, show more cute toddlers too! Retards.
Anybody else cringe when she missed the door handle with her hand?
This is so forced, it sucks. Those dogs aren't even happy to see you
That's actually the worst type of customer service
Staged 
I didn't know women were allowed on reddit....
do dog lovers get off on watching pathetic dogs doing any submissive obedient act? does it make you feel like the "alpha" that you never could be in real life with actual humans? so you use these dogs to feel dominant?

Review: Justin Bieber-never say never

Justin Bieber is one of the influential avant garde metal artists. Never Say Never is the magnum opus of Justin Bieber that album tackles many complex subjects such as self identity, corruption, and the corrupt ideology of politics the album tackles all of these subjects in a beautiful fashion each song takes its time to tackle each of these issues songs like up as an example tells the story of a lost man trying to understand who he truly in the 2nd verse of the song he begins to go in an existential crisis for over 10 minutes then goes quickly goes onto a instrumental part supported composed by Philip Glass and Steve Reich which leads onto the third verse where Justin Bieber sings about how phones and modern technology is just creature comfort to our inevitable end, the album then leads onto the next track overboard which features Bob Dylan, the both of the artists meld together perfectly Justin Bieber's low but melodic haunting voice and Bob Dylan fantastic guitar skills work together perfectly. The last and arguably best song born to be somebody tackles  the philosophy of society and the way it can make or break an individual. The album overall is an impressive feat for any artist and stands out in Justin Bieber's discography and all of history as one of the most creative and impressive works of mankind overall this album is undoubtedly a 11/10
