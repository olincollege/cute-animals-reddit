"I don't like OP" and "I don't like pit bulls" are not reasons to report a post. Please stop.
My cat sits by me and alerts my partner when I have a seizure. I know it's not as cool but I am proud of him. 
It's the opposite with my dog. She has epilepsy and suffers fits sometimes. It can be very scary seeing someone you love have an episode so we just try and protect her, make sure she doesn't hurt herself until she's lucid again. Then afterwards she gets lots of hugs.
Extra good boy 
Dog: "This is fine.  Everything is fine.  Seriously, I've got you."  :)

Saw this was posted yesterday on /r/videos (based on post title) but didn't click because I didn't feel like watching a video at the time.

I literally said to myself, "I'll just wait til /u/GallowBoob turns it into a gif."

And here we are...
This is also my dog when I try to do pushups. She's also a good girl.
What did we do to deserve dogs?
Not all heroes wear capes.
> This is how Colt is trained to block my head during a seizure, because I have a TBI it is very dangerous for me to hit my head, I can literally die if I hit my head really bad again. This is only a reenactment, this is NOT a real seizure. And no of course I'm not really hitting my head in this video. This is just us keeping up with his training, I have to test him on everything that he knows often to make sure he still does it all reliably. He is trained to do this in a certain way that keeps both him and me safe, he will not get hurting doing this the way he has been trained to. I'm not actually there during a seizure so I would not be able to know if he did his job right or not. The middle video is basically a blooper, I laughed so hard, the floor was super slippery and he had a hard time getting his body under my 10lb head. The important thing that makes me super proud is that he never stops trying. He always looks back to make sure I am safe and keeps trying till I am. I am so blessed to have him. He has saved my life in many ways.

GREAT BOY STATUS UNLOCKED. 
"You call it training, I call it snuggles" -Dog probably
"I'm helping because I love you"


That is one really good dog. He's all like "OK Momma we play the game where I force you to use me as a pillow, yeah I know momma im a lumpy pillow but beatin your head on me won't fix it"
I was always taught to not touch the person when they're having a seizure and to just clear everything from around them. Would the dog pushing his body under her head like that not be a risk?    
If not, this is adorable as it is amazing. I'm not trying to be the devil's advocate here. Just wanna know some stuff about things, ya know?
This is so badass. Just to be clear though, that woman is faking a seizure right now for the sake of the training right? I've never actually seen anyone have a seizure so I couldn't say what it looks like
My mom has epilepsy and is moderately functioning. How can we get her a good boy like this one?
Throwaway to say that dogs are amazing and their pureness makes me cry. When I was a teenager, I had a self harm problem. I'm currently 3 years free. What made me stop? We got my dog 3 years ago. She caught me self harming ONCE and started barking up a storm and jumped up on me, trying to knock the scissors out of my hands. Still makes me cry to this day. Love you, Marlee <3
Perfect, sweet boy.
That's a good boy. 
And now I'm crying.
The girl in the video says the dog is a weimaraner and labrador mix. It does not say anywhere that it is a pitbull?
I tried this with my cat. 

He sat on my head. 
I have one of these animals. Sure, they have the potential to be aggressive and violent - but that's just like any other animal or person that you teach and mentor. These animals have all the same ability to love and be sweet. It's all about who the owner is, what environments they are exposed to, and how you treat them.

I adopted a pitbull that was 5 days away from being put down just because she was a pitbull who was found on the street with no known history. 

She's the best fucking thing to happen to my life. I was in severe depression with no feeling of purpose and she put light back into my life. 

Edit - this comment won't be at the top and that's fine, but for those who do see this don't buy into the stereotypes. This video provides visual proof of how loving and emotionally aware these animals are.

I wish I could take them all home.
For those that don't know, the owner already suffers from a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury), so if she ever hits her head hard enough, she could die. The dog is literally saving her life when she does have seizures.
OP said it was a weimaraner/lab mix. Not a pit.
Dogs are amazing! 
Not a pit bull folks.
Nothing brings a dog more happiness than a purpose or a way to contribute. It reminds me of the 9/11 search and rescue dogs. They were so determined to find living people, that they got depressed. Search and rescuers had to bury themselves in rubble so the dogs could find a living person. 
"It's okay mom I lie here now."
Fuck those pitbull bans. Ban bad owners
The goodest boy!!
Dogs sense of smell is so acute they can smell cancer. Penn Vet Working Dog Clinic is working with dogs to do this.
I had a Pitt Bull named Tyson that ended up becoming my brother's dog. My brother has some issues, and Tyson seemed to always calm him down. It's almost as if Tyson knew what to do. He's been registered as a service dog now, and is still happily taking care of my brother. 
Let's be real, OP doesn't repost, he "crossposts" but if reposting wasn't so looked down upon he would do it in a heartbeat. Makes money from it either way, though.
That neck game.
If you saw the youtube video, the owner clearly says the dog was hand picked from the litter by herself and a behavioralist.

https://youtu.be/ZskqSLnMDRQ

I'm much more inclined to believe the owner over a redditor.
I didn't think I could love dogs more, but I was wrong.
This is what a dog does. A cat, on the other hand, would back up to her so her face was bouncing on its ass, because cats are fucking jerks.
I see in his eyes that he understands this is serious. Dogs are too good for us. 
This is not a pit bull, this is Colt the Service Dog, he is a Weimaraner/Lab, look up their YouTube channel! 
I have a cat that will calm me down. I get super stressed and have panic attacks. A dr said I probably have PTSD because of my past. But my cat wasn't even trained to do this. She was on discount at a local pet store that sold animals for the humane society. I didnt even want a cat at the time but felt a connection with her and her roommate. I also didn't want them to die bc that is where they were headed.

Every time I'm upset or angry she comes and cuddles me. The more pissed off i get the harder she cuddles me. She sleeps on me every night. Sets me know when to calm down and it makes me a better person.

Animals rock.
I teared up watching, as a wee lad my dog was my best m8 and no matter how horrible shit got in my house or outside,he was always there to comfort me. I wish i could tell him how much i loved him and still do. 
God he's the best boy, doing a great job 👍🏼
I don't know why, but I always thought dogs would attack people having seizures. No logic to it, but I just thought they would.
WE ARE NOT WORTHY
Please cross post this in r/epilepsy!  I think some of us would find it interesting 
We don't deserve dogs.

"That looks like it hurts... Here use my head instead" 
I should show this to the people who I work with who get mad whenever a non-blind person walks in with a service dog...
"The lengths I go to for a little petting..."

Joking aside, dogs are awesome, especially service dogs. 
He should've put a wallet in her mouth. 
*Oh my gosh this is so cool! OP must be someone who works with service dogs I'd love to ask them about it!* 
**sees username**
*nevermind.*
This is not the dogs owner. She is not having a seizure. This is a woman training a service dog. OP took someone's video that was on my front page earlier today and made it into a GIF. 
Good boy, just don't get your ear caught in her mouth or you'll have a bad time. 
I had to do that when my dachshund had seizures. Guess that makes me a service human. But seriously I'd do it all over again. I miss that dog!
His eyes were saying "I hope mama is okay.." 

We don't deserve dogs. What a good boy! 
For those talking sh** and not taking it serious, 1 glorious day you would wish you had a magnificent animal like this watching out for you.  People suck, so dont expect bystanders to help. #natureisfukinglit andhumansarenotworthy
Nicest dog I ever knew was a Staffy bull  bitch called Maxie, I didnt own her she was a part of the family, she died a few years ago age 15, she would have gone to the grave to help a human, most loving animal I've ever known, was brilliant with children never so much as showed her teeth never mind bit one, I honestly put her on a higher level than half the humans on this planet x RIP maxie
How is this not a dog of the pit bull category? 

The big dopey head, the streamlined ears when active, and the muscular physique. 

Looks like a staffy, which is counted among pit breeds
Fuck yeah dog! You go dog! I hope she's alright though
I know what to do, I'm a good dog.
How awesome that a dog is trained to absorb the blows and weight of a human head during a traumatic seizure. 

And not moving . Waiting for his master to be okay . 

What little troopers we have 
Dogs, dude. Dogs.
Just another reason why man kind does not deserve dogs. 
This is either a pit bull mix or another bully-breed mix if not a pit bull. regardless of breed this love and trust between dog an owner gave me the happy sniffly tears 
The definition of training a service dog!
We don't deserve dogs!
We don't deserve dogs
And people say pitbulls are bad doggos
Its about time pit bulls were recognized for their many uses. Did you know pit bulls were bred as nanny dogs, to help watch small children? The more you know
That made me cry. I <3 pit bulls 
What a beautifully trained service dog! 
Pit bulls are a beautiful breed. It clearly shows it is not the breed that is dangerous, but the humans. 
This was beautiful. To see dogs do such important things for their humans is so touching.
Such a good doggo. 
I've never seen anything like this.  It's so amazing what dogs can do.  We're so lucky.
People who are shaming pitbulls are fucking stupid. Those dogs are the most loving breeds you can get, it's the owners responsibility to train their dog correctly. I've had two pits in my life, one when I was around 6 and another at 19. Both of them had/have zero problems in public, loved children and other dogs. Their loyal, protective and loving. 
Pitbulls are great but according to the source video this is actually a Weimaraner/English Labrador mix. (The poster says so in the FAQ)
We don't deserve dogs. We probably never will.
Meanwhile a cat would be like.... "Ugh human?... Human? Feed me now!
Had a customer have a seizure when I was working at Home Depot; it hit her as she was sitting down on a low pallet of tile. She had her service dog in training with her, and as soon as we got the woman to the ground, her dog crawled under her right shoulder, prying upward. The pup got the customer on her side in record time. No hesitation. The best pup in the house. The service dog stayed there while I kept the seizing woman's head from knocking the ground until paramedics arrived. He/she may have been in training, but that lil doggo sure did their duty.

Oooooooooooooo what a good boy!!!! <3
What a good boy!
*licks mutton chops*

"job well done" -colt
That is fantastic. But I love the slightly sad look in the dog's eyes at the end "Oh well, I guess this is my life now". It's the same look I get when I perfect a task at work and discover it's rubbish
I fking love dogs
Dogs are the best. What else can you say.
What a good dog!
I miss my dog so much. :(
Dogs are so fucking amazing!
What a good boy

Goes to show how smart and caring Pitbuls can actually be. Quite possibly my favorite breed of dog.
The comment section can't be that baa... oh man...
I'm not crying! I just have something in my eye
Give him all the medals
Animals are sensitive to changes in people's emotional state.  Has anyone ever watched **The Dog Whisperer**?  Cesar Millan has spent his life trying to understand how dogs can sense changes in an owner's physical condition and emotional state.  
Service animals are legally allowed to accompany owners under many circumstances:

That is incredible. Dogs are incredible.
We don't deserve dogs.
I wish I was a cuddle dog. 
Sweet sweet puppy!!!!
Aww... one less human...
And my dog just shit on the couch. 

Sighhh... Pekingese. So cute. So dumb. So cute. 
She's not actually having a seizure. She's training her dog to recognize when she is
G O O D B O Y ! 
I saw the video without reading the title first and thought to myself "why is this girl banging her head on the ground like a fish"
I feel like I just saw this.
How the fack did they train him to do that so carefully. My dog is two I think she finally has "shake"...and now she kinda just throws her paw at me whenever she wants attention, sometimes scratching my face 
I love dogs so much fuck this was the best thing I've seen all week
Can you believe there are actually bastards out there cold hearted enough to
Hate these poor animals?
For a second, I thought it was a cat's head on a human body
This is disturbing me
i laughed
Having a dog is wonderful, great family members.
This is my dog when I'm trying to do crunches.. every time.
Now THAT is a good boy.
I'm glad she has this 🐕
Annnnddd here I am late afternoon, at work, crying. This is too cute.
This dog probably thinks his owner is extremely strange and is just in it for the treats.
😢 little pibble doing his human a service. 
Try that with a cat... (rolls eyes)
He's not a Pit. He's a weimeraner/lab. 
I would give this dog a medal for saving his owner....
I'm suspicious that the dog isn't just looking for opportunistic patting.
This is too adorable!! 
Damn I love dogs.  :') 
ask not what your doggo can do for you—ask what you can do for your doggo.
Just here to say I wish my friend had this dog. He suffered from epilepsy...and died due to a massive head trauma. 

I would say that I'm extremely thankful to the people that train these animals to look after us humans. But part of me thinks that all animals look out for all living things...then I subscribed to r/natureisfuckingmetal and that removed that thought...but I never see a dog on there.

Dogs are awesome 
Makes me think how my Sam acted when he saw me have a seizure. He sort of stared at me when I opened my eyes and then when he detected my consciousness he wagged and dived on me but I wonder what his thoughts were when he had to watch me All by himself, makes me sad, I miss him
Mans best friend at work again. 🤘🏼really cool
Why does it say Not a Pitbull? Is it not?
Service dogs completly amaze me.
I like /u/gallowboob and I like /r/pitbulls
Good boy...or girl. Dogs are amazing. Im looking at my english springer now.  She's just chilling peacfully, staring across the back yard, sitting in the grass beneath our feet. A rare wind is blowing, the result of a needed rain. It's cool 88 in Austin from a ninety
...SCORCH ur brain hot day. This Texan, Tejano is Drinking a Lone Star tall boy on a hamock chair swing on my deck. And I thank the universe for this day and im amazed at the courage people have. Like the lady in this video. Good doggo. I just used doggo publicly.  
/u/GallowBoob 
Ngl i cried a little at this. I've never seen anything like it, thankyou.
I'm literally crying tears because dogs are so good and pure in this world. Dogs are amazing to learn this!
We've got the BEST DOGGO'S HAVEN'T WE FOLKS?!?!
Dogs are really heaven sent.
The title says "not a pitbull". How'd that get determined? Looks pretty pitty to me. 
I'm not into dogs, but that right there? That's a good boy.
At first glance I thought this was a human with a cat head gasping for air. 
Wow. Dogs are awesome. Probably better than humans I guess!
This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Beyond awesome pup. 
That's a *damn good dog*
we don't deserve dogs
Dogs are amazing animals! 
TIL: Pirbulls are used as service dogs. 
TIAL: Pitbull service dogs are awesome.
This is too pure. What did we ever do to deserve dogs? 😭
Dogs are bros
We don't deserve dogs

WHO'S A GOOD BOY
"Service dog job? Hmmm I dunno......."

"You get lots of free pettings during a seizure."

"Okay cool, sign me up!"
Now that's a VERY good boy 
I love pitbulls and OP is pretty cool.
They really are a good dawg when properly trained and socialized. 
Can we give his more upvotes!
Amazingly smart dog!!!
This is very heartwarming. Upvoted and faved
Cats wouldn't be good at this because they would just start playing with your hair
We do not deserve dogs. Do not care if it's a repost. Cannot be said enough. 
They're like furry angels. 
Good doggie!
Plot twist, the pup just wants cuddles. Still surprisingly effective!
This goodboy is going for 100k karma.
Have an updoot good boy.
Look at the dog's eyes at the end! That made me cry
Why I love dogs
What a darling. As the mom of a child that has seizures,  this melts my heart. 
It's probably already been said 1k times but needs to be said again. We do not deserve dogs. 
Omg this made me tear up. Bless that pit bull ❤️
What did we do without them.
Holy fuck thats awesome!
We don't deserve the dogs, man
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Dogs are amazing. 
There are no words to describe how much this touched me on an emotional level and this coming from a person who is terrible at emotion almost to the lack there of.
Dogs are too good for this world. In a perfect world they would be the dominant species 
Heartwarming.
This is awesome.  My pittie ate Taco Bell fire sauce out of the garbage today.  I'm gonna show him this.
TIL the most common neurological disease that dogs have are seizures. 
It's derpy face at the end. "Me do a good boy job" 
What did we do to deserve such unbelievably amazing doggos 😭
Dogs are awesome
So awesome! 
My brother in law gets these awful attacks and it really sucks seeing someone you love.
Staffys/pittys make such good service dogs because they love their people so much. This is adorable to see. xx
My pit Hershey just passed away last Saturday. I've been very depressed and probably will be for a while now. Seeing this video has really given me a happy. 

Pitbulls are the best breed out there, hands down. 
She has epilepsy and seeing a dog like this watching out for you.
That sweet look and the lick of the chops she gives when she knows she's done her job 😇good girl. (Just seems like a girl to me)
u/chriswaitforit see pibbles can be service dogs😍😍😍
Dogs are just amazing. 
If you don’t get to someone who is having a seizure right away, can they die?
What a good boy
Relatively Irrelevant Question: How did they capture this footage? Is there just a camera on the ground to capture this part of the room?
I had a seizure at home sat on the sofa when I was home alone with my dog, I came round to him sat next to me with his head on my shoulder and his paw on my chest like he was checking I was okay. It seemed extra cute because he’s not allowed on the sofa usually 
Such a good boy :)
Very good boy !
The look on the pups face makes me tear up a bit ehh 
Pit Bulls and Pit mixes are absolutely wonderful dogs .. loving and gentle. I’ve had 2 in my life.  Humans are the problem. 
Oh. I'm gonna cry. Sweet precious protector. 
Not that it matters but that's not a pitbull.  From the Youtube video, the owner says the dog is a Weimeraner/English Lab mix.
GOOD DOG
Becomes handy when you want a pillow but you're too lazy to get one!
And people complaint about pitbulls.
The goodest of good boys
Him do a protec
Good dog. Pits are so precious, I'm sure this little one will make an excellent service dog. 
Idk even though it says not a Pitbull... Looks a lot like the one I had. Anyone that thinks they are predisposed to violence is just ignorant. Any breed can be trained to attack.  Two corgis attacked my Doberman/Rottweiler and he didn't retaliate.  He sat down and cried and had a slit ear from it. 

There is no doubt in my mind that if I was having a seizure, my pit bull would step on me. She has absolutely zero self awareness. She's the best though and I love her. Such a good dog.
belly rubs with the head?
weird, but OK.

wag wag
No bad dogs. Only bad owners/trainers.
Someone please tell me what the fuck did we do to deserve dogs. What a beautiful, wholesome creature...
Pitbulls are such blessings.
Pitbulls rock. I miss my pit girl. 
To whoever say pitbulls are aggressive, then you are wrong humans are the aggressive one that instigate they nature in such beautiful companions 😢
Pits get such a bad reputation. They are truly amazing dogs
That just melted my heart, I love dogs so much, pit-bulls are my favourite, so loving 
pit bulls are the most loyal, protective, no nonsense dogs if treated and raised with respect.  best dog i have ever had.
A pit bull bite me a few weeks ago ( I'm a mailman ) can't ever be mad at such sweet dogs for protecting their homes. Also this is cute as hell
THE GOODEST BOY. 😭
I never thought I would enjoy having a cat as a pet but since living with my girlfriend who has a cat, I have learned that they can be very compassionate and a joy to be around. With that said, Chum (our cat) would never "stick his neck out" to protect me. This is why dogs will always be number one.
"We tried to teach a cat the same thing with an epileptic, but instead of helping the cat would go and turn on the strobe light"
I swear man. Pitties are about the most beautiful dogs ever. To my mind they truly are the most perfect breed of dog.
Pits are great dogs.  Too bad they get a bad rap from shitty owners.  While they are bred and trained to be killing machines, the ones that are trained to be kind make awesome pets.  R.I.P. Caesar, you misbehaving little shit.  You were still loads of fun.
If you don't like pit bulls, I don't like you.
Kinda weird that you mention the breed. 
No other posts mentions non pit breeds when referring to service dogs, do they?

I smell an agenda. 
Wow. This is incredible. As someone who has seizures this hits close to home. Pit bulls rule!!!
There is such a terrible stigma around pits. They are incredibly warm and caring when raised with love. I love seeing examples that show the counter-narrative.
That's so awesome. How wonderful that woman and others suffering with seizures have a friend to help them prevent further injury. 
I love pitties even more 💓

I just burst into tears 
Aww, big scary pibble 💙💙 
I was told in medical class not to hold their head. Don't do anything except clear the area of dangerous objects. But hell idk.
we humans don't deserve these wonderful, joy and love filled beings,

And people say pit bulls are bad breeds. It just goes to show that it's not the animal but what you make the animal that counts, as this pit bull is clearly intelligent and compassionate enough to do its job and prevent injury, as opposed to causing injury which they're constantly slated for.
Most remarkable thing I've seen in a while. Pit bulls are so lovable and so caring for there owners! She chose a great service dog! 
We literally don't deserve dogs <3 
My dogs both do this without any training...they have different intentions, though. PAY ATTENTION TO US.
This is so amazing, it makes me tear up.
Wow, that's amazing.
What a good doggy
That is a very good dog.
Wow! Such a good boy!
I know I'm projecting, but seeing the look in the dogs eyes, it was afraid but so willing to protect her. I'm totally crying. 
I want a dog
If my dog does this already (tried it out to see what he would do) does it mean he has potential to be a service animal? 
If I had seizures like that, I wouldn't have laminate flooring. 
Wow its just amazing how much animals care about us... it almost makes me cry. As someone who suffers from depression, i want a dog really bad 
What a good boy (or girl).
Beautiful dog, but you're wrong about the breed - Colt is a lab/weimaraner (but just as good of a dog nonetheless)
Wow, that's amazing. Smart creatures they are!
reverse gif gets me everytime
well trained 
Truly mankind's best friend.
Omg❤️❤️❤️I love how he's like " it's okay! I'll protect you friend :)"
And here I am and I can't even get my dog to stop pissing in the house.
Im just gonna type some stuff and say good boy
Good dog! 
I love him so much.
I swear to god I saw this exact gif in the morning.
He knows exactly who's a good boy. 
Absolutely amazing! Give that dog all the snacks.
Omg ! Cool
I cried watching this.
Who's a good boy???
Looks like Cosby was here.
Wow the human race truly don't deserve such amazing animals.
Good dog. 
Good boy :)
No, you are crying.
Yeah, humans are not worthy of dogs. They are far too good to us.
Dogs Are The Best!
Can't figure out if this is cute or amazing so i'll just leave it at both.
[**Here's the original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingBros/comments/6sab96/service_pitbull_training_to_protect_mamas_head/) YouTube video from last night via r/AnimalsBeingBros for anyone interested
can we do this with elected representatives?
to the post itself - this is certainly uplifting, not sure if aww, if it weren't galloboob i'd upvote it for sure
I wouldn't be able to stop from laughing if I was the person training the dog to crawl under my face. My dog does this already if he can't see my face and i'm laying down.
Good boy
Why was this being recorded
Heartwarming stuff man. I fucking love my Staff.
Dogs are the best.
How the hell do you train a dog to do that?
This makes me emotional... thanks. 
good pup!
Angel 😇

Today at work i saw a service dog alert its owner that her blood sugar was getting low. It was amazing.
[deleted]
My eyes started tearing up:( that's so sweet and loving. I know that dog was trained but regardless that's so casting of him or her. 
Fuck me. I love that dog
Well that's certainly something the NHS never offered me 
That's amazing! What a good dog! 
Was just now listening to a song posted yesterday, [Prismo - Hold On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU8OwUx_w3c) and it was just saying the lyric: 

"And I said 
Hey oh just let it go your struggles won't remain 
And I said Hey oh we're holding hope in wake of yesterday
So hold on to me 
Hold on to me 
Hold on, hold on to me!"

Right as the doggo snuggled his way under her. Bam waterworks all over the place. I'm a grown man, but damn that was amazing timing.
that sweet face!
Here. Bump on me instead. I'm softer. <3
There's quite a list of things that could not be done without trained dogs, come to think of it.
I have had epilepsy for like 12 years and never considered I could be eligible for something line that. Cool!
"I am pillow doge!"
When I had seizures, my dog would just sit on me lol
Couldn't that really hurt the dog if the seizure is violent enough?
Why is this post making me cry?
I remember laying down behind my old flatmate to stop him against the wall when he was having a seizure. Had some nasty bruises after that, a 15 stone guy can sure throw some power about when his brain decides to go nuclear.

Is this physically safe for the dog?
Guud doggo
Goodboye Givin a soft
What a cute pupper. I have a small jack-chi that does this exact same thing, except he does it for attention, not to save me from anything... well maybe boredom. 
This is literally one of the most adorable and sweetest things I've ever seen.
I freaking love dogs
DOGGO to the rescue.
I spoke to a gentleman at the grocery store today with a service dog. His dog was trained to position itself to catch the man when he would stumble due to a balance issue. Animals are amazing!
G O O D B O Y E
¡DALE! 
is this staged?
this looks staged
This is why animals are better than most humans 
Dogs > cats all day every day.
Super cool. Could you also get carpet instead of hardwood to help mitigate any possible head trauma?
Seizure/epilepsy service animals are trained to either detect the change in chemicals or pick up on characteristics in their handlers to respond accordingly. Some of these animals will never respond to a chemical change but will know that a certain action dictates them to perform a task aka protecting her head when the dog sees her hitting it. It can be no different than teaching a dog to speak on command. 
Cute
Who's recording this? Shouldn't they be helping?
So who filmed this while she was head banging
Expected more chomp.
That's just beautiful 
Only been 12 hours since this was last on top of /all.
I had to watch it about ten times to realise whether that thing having a "seizure" on the floor was a human or not. Am I the only one...?
Awww good dog.
Good do...no, OUTSTANDING dog!
I need to teach my dog to do this for my Wife. Thankfully her Grand Mal are rare, but she's suffered so many concussions in the past year or so.
Reason why dogs are called man's best friend!
Falling and head injuries FROM falling are **so much more** terrifying than I realized before my little sister developed epilepsy, which is apparently pretty common in cognitively impaired kids. She didn't start having seizures until she was 16 and the first was in such a spectacularly bloody fashion that over 5 years later I'm STILL dealing with the fallout from the PTSD I developed (I've always had low-key anxiety, this spiked it into an entirely new level of "anything-and-everything can kill you")... let alone what my mom and sister have to live with.

They have it mostly under control now and she doesn't have the grand mal seizures anymore but she'll still seize long enough to fall and then space out for a while. Poor kid's torn her ACL, had 2 black eyes, a broken nose, a bruised rib, more split lips than I can count, and she suction-cupped the small of her back to the side of the tub which turned her entire lower back green and purple, all in the last 3-4 months. I would LOVE for her to get a seizure dog. 
I am continually amazed that we can train dogs for this sort of thing. I understand the mechanics of how they are able to sense these things, but the fact that they know to do something appropriate about it is really amazing. 
That's amazing!
That is beautiful. What a good boy.
TIL my dog is trained to protect my head in case I ever have a seizure, cuz she does this shit without prompting.  
What if they get smothered ?
He's a good boy.
"The camera slowly pans to the left revealing the shadowed figure of a cat slowly licking it's paw. He glances up to see what is causing the annoying noise that has distracted him from his important cleaning process. After realizing it's just the stupid dog heroically saving the stupid human without concern for its own body as it places itself between the floor and the stupid human's head. He watches for a few moments hoping the stupid dog would fail in its desperate attempt to keep the stupid human safe. He decides that this is getting boring and will now amuse himself by vomiting on the stupid human's pillow."
Someone please reverse this lol 
I am I pit bull and I am offended by OP and her seizures

Omg what a champ haha
Goodest of the good boys! <3
Wow
I was very curious as to how you train a dog to do this. I was, let down. 
This is one of the cooler things I've seen on here about dogs. 
Is this a exercise to acclimate the pup? I've never witnessed a seizure that was that "controlled". My father use to have gran mal seizures, they were violent and hard, not like this.
So much dog love!
If we can create dogs out of wolves why cant we create good people out of shitty people?
OMG, I almost cried.
Awww, good dog.
Dogs are so loving and most of the times better than humans at understanding emotions ! 
I like how he's  just like "I love my job." theres just a satisfied look on hos face.
Omg, I love dogs. 
My dog something similar when I'm doing push ups. And once, my sister told me she passed out and my dog ran to her quickly. Good thing my mother was there to take her to the hospital because I wasn't home. She's a good dog that loves us, and my family loves her.
Just a reminder that dogs are awesome animals. I can't wait to get a place of my own so I can get one.
God dammit dogs are the fucking best
THis is the sweetest thing I've seem all day. I volunteer at my local SPCA & there are so so many pit bulls that go unadopted cause of their reputation I guess, its sad really. Most are good dogs...
As an epileptic, I wish I had one of these little guys
*I'm sobbing.*
Well that made me cry... =) 
Good dog.
I'm crying??
Good doggo.
<3 that sweet pibble face
Many epilepsy service dogs are actually trained to identify psychogenic spells that aren't epileptic seizures.

I wish my dog gave a damn about me
Wonderful animal, dogs are amazing!
/r/MadeMeCry
What a beautiful animal.
Good doggo
"Oh, a massage session going on now!"
He's a good dog
The goodest boy I ever did see
:~((((( but also :~)))))
Crying 😭 
TBH I thought her hair was a werewolfs face transforming.
So is no one going to point out that someone just filmed this and let the girl smack her head on the ground?
Good dog?
Is it bad that the human looks more like a dog than the dog did?
Dogs are pure. Nothing more needs to be said. 
We don't deserve dogs 
"No human! The floor is hard, headbutt me instead!"
My dog literally ran straight into my nuts while I was watching this
We do not deserve dogs. Damn that's beautiful. 
I have no idea how people live without dogs. Some people have apartments with rules against that, but if you are able to get a dog you should have one. They're fucking great. No better feeling after a shit day of work or school coming home to your dog that acts like he hasn't seen you in decades. 
why is it filming
So who has the camera on the floor and is just watching 
This made me shed some tears of joy! 
That is impressive
I thought the girl was lying on her back. Scrolled through the comments and didn't understand why no one was commenting on crazy face. Scrolled back to video and realized that I was trippin'
Very good dog, but not great that he stopped to film it first
just get a floor made of pillows
I think he's just trying to chill. 
Bless this pup, bless the trainer, and bless whoever realized the possibilities and benefits of service animals.  A strong bond of trust & love on both sides, and living fuller lives made possible.
Thankyou!
This is love

Well, you know, it's just a dog, but that's really inspiring and moving 
Teach it to dial 911 instead 
This is my good news for the day.
Whatever type of dog that is, I love how they look very happy with themselves after their job is done :)
Good doggo
Was this not posted this morning?
Haha his face once he's under her it's like he knows he's doing his job and is saying "this will pass, don't worry."
This is so frickin amazing/cool. It trips me out how smart dogs are and what they can be trained to do. 
Buddy, my mother's demon dog will turn from trying to murder me to a superhero when something is wrong around me. No training.
Oh my, I know we say it all the time but we really don't deserve dogs 
P I L L O W B O Y E
Real life hachiko
I am old and grumpy but this just melted my heart.

When I suffered with epilepsy (thankfully I don't anymore) my dog used to just bark at me. Everytime. Maybe he thought he was gonna scare away the seizure lol. Who knows?? 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
Very cool (not to mention **cute**), but I was under the impression that the initial fall and tongue biting/ choking were the main dangers involved with seizures. Can the dog catch her too, cause thay would be so cool. 
Who's going to set this to Smells like teen spirit?
And now I have a nightmare image of a woman convulsing on the floor and the poor dog laying there with her, in an empty house, until she dies, right there on the dog's side. . . .
This warmed my heart so much.

Good boy.
Who's filming this?
r/thisismylifenow
i need such a pet :'(
more than a pet
What a great doggo 
This is one of the most touching things I've ever seen. I don't care if the dog was trained or not, if the person is faking it to get a reaction from the pup. It's just touching, no explanation needed. 
"Look at me, I'm a pillow!"
How come dogs can somehow sense things like Seizures, cancers and blood sugar levels?

Humans are so boring, we grow fingernails...no special powers (excluding the fact we are the most sentient beings on earth)
Thats pretty cool. 
What a good boy
Pure love.
Dogs are so great!

This is awesome. But if it were me and my pit in this situation, he would just lick my face...
My dog does this as well. When I lay on the floor she will do her best to force her way under me. Seems like a submissive/snuggle thing that has the added benefit of helping those who suffer siezures
I'm not crying, I'm just sweating from my eyeballs.
Ugh this makes me tear up just watching. I've had a few unknown seizures and it made me feel so good seeing how he was protecting her. hitting your head and waking up with that feeling is awful. good doggo. 
We don't deserve the love of dogs 
What a good boy (or girl), and what a blessing for that human.  
Whoever is training this dog KUDOS. That is some difficult upper level work that dog is doing right there. 
What a G O O D B O Y E
that is so cool.
That's amazing.
My hearrrrrrrrrrt ❤️❤️❤️
I don't understand what is having a seizure
Mans eternal best friend.
