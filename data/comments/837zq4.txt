I upvote otters
No matter how unreasonable it might be to have a pet otter, I will never stop wanting one.
And my dog manages to eat it‚Äôs own poo 
Masterfully trained by asian Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
Carry around an otter, and I‚Äôm immediately attracted to you. I fall for it every time. 
I keep forgetting Otters have thumbs.  

I wish Dogs had thumbs too :-(  

Edit: I have since retracted this wish due to being reminded Dogs are already perfect.

Can we all agree shootings otters is not ok 
I'm always so delighted whenever I get to see how smart otters are. Beautiful little creatures!
Aw! The way he goes back to it when he realizes they‚Äôre not done playing. The best. 
I am a simple woman. I see otter. I upvote.

How is no one talking about how attractive the guy is?
Water pupper doin a trick 
Some people dream of getting married and living a long, rich life surrounded by people who love them.

Some people dream of fame and fortune.

Some people dream of making history.

I dream of having a pet otter.  
One of my finest performances.
Gonna need some more footage of this talented duo. Or, ya know, just the trainer.
That man is sexy.
That little face cover up!
Is it just me or is this man unfairly attractive?
I want one
I shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy!
I love his tiny hands.
Bet this dude is brothers with the rainstorm and river and probably has a heron friend too.

*You're pretty good*
No one will ever convince me that otters are not water doggos.
I‚Äôve always wondered how people train animals to play dead like that. Sitting, staying, heeling, are all intuitive animal moves, but this? That‚Äôs some human level gesturing.
Otters are water cats and i want one
Is that little nub a penis 
I'm now adding "must have pet otter who does tricks" to my requisites for dating prospects. 
Beavers are pretty cool. 
I find this unbelievably cute even compared to the general levels of this sub.
This is my son at bedtime
I used to live in a floating home and the resident otters used to hang out underneath my floor and loudly try to make baby otters.
how do you.... train the otter to do that?
Free my people from doing tricks for treats! We still demand the treats though!
List of animals we need to domesticate to the degree of dogs:

1. Bears
2. Otters
I was having a kind of bad day today. But now I‚Äôm not. I love this. 
You're pretty good
Guns of the Patriots!... Might need work, or at least more nanomachines.
Whaat how does the otter know?
I want to pet or tickle that otter belly so much. Like so so much. 
How do you train animals to do that kind of stuff?
Revolver Otter-lot.
I need one of these in my life. They are so cool and smart. And i need a red panda, they are so fluffy and retarded. They'd make the ultimate pet couple.
Otters are like real life Disney characters
This video is a great example of why Reddit is so important. 
Finger gun and pets never gets old. Need more. :)
u/endlesskylieness you in the mornings when I turn the hallway light on 
What you don't know is that in order to train them to do this, you have to shoot them with a pellet gun several hundred times before they cover their eyes instinctively.
That guy is hot 
I need an otter the way I need oxygen. 
Did you guys know that otters rape and kill baby seals

What happens when an Otter is trained by Busquets üòÇ
Otters>Any other animal 
Animals have personalities. I bet if your Cat/Dog could talk they will still be disappointed in you. 
Nobody said "...aaand CUT". 
"Are we finished? -Oh no, we're not finished!"
God damn otters is there any they can't cute.
Acting!!! 
I wonder how do they het trained in order to do stuff like this.
I said "aww," and then nodded because of course I did.
I want a pocket otter
Crazy animal!!!! Crazy!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I have to wonder how on earth animals learn this.

He is pointing at me with a finger, then doing some kind of gesture. Do I.... what, exactly? Do animals understand that the hand is resembling a gun, which kills, and that they are playing dead?
cute
I love how he starts with smell my finger. Think he's got a shrimp in that gun?
So cute.
I want one!

Vhhhhvv
I think South Park might of had it right. Otters are the next species to climb the ladder.
How the hell did he train an otter?
So cute :)
You otter post that in the interwebz.
Anybody have any idea what it takes to have one as a pet? Serious question. Not serious about getting one as a pet though.
How is an animal taught this trick?
Lol
Is it just me, or does anyone else think he looks like a pokeman trainer?
I think this might be my official favorite gif on the entire internet. Thank you
This is so pure and wholesome. I'm usually a cold, unfeeling, heartless asshole. But this...... this made my heart smile üò¢üòç
Awww cute Lil oddor 
I feel like Otters should be added to the list of non-human persons. 
What year is it?
Mark Wahlbergs acting is getting better ( for all the DLM fans)
The whole weasel family is just amazing.
How smart are otters to pick something like this up? I hope no cruelty was used to train them.
Awwter

Dam, that‚Äôs cute. 
I've had a very good day today and this is so good it's still the highlight of my day.

You have to wait until you hear ‚Äúcut‚Äù!

So cute! üíñ
I'm pleasantly surprised at the lack of otter puns in the comments
We have a lot of wild river otters on the west coast and they actually seem pretty grumpy. I've had them growl and hiss at me while kayaking near a beach. Minks and those Fishers/beach weasel things too.
what pokemon is this
He just needs little overalls and a straw hat and my life will be complete.
Awwww

No matter how many times someone knowingly and shamelessly reposts this for karma, I‚Äôll always love it because it‚Äôs an otter.

Otter learn to play dead better.
I love this otter more than I love my momma
[deleted]
Pointing your fingers at otters is incredibly stressful to otters. This is abuse plain and simpy 

E: obvious troll plebeians 
People never thing about the amount of beatings and unhealthy snacks it takes to make an animal do cutesy shit like this
He probably beats the shit out of that otter to train it to do that.
Edit: https://youtu.be/zZ1InXglIYA

Dont know why im getting downvoted. I mean the link in my edit shows people beating dogs to train them to do weird shit. So why not an otter?
