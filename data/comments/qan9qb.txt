Forbidden friendship
You're probably losing a lot of heat out the edges of that window, why the fix likes it there
‚ÄúThe dog creature must sleep outside, in the elements. This pleases cat.‚Äù
Knowing cats and knowing foxes, they are both fantasizing about murdering each other. And thinking about it makes them happy.
Just a heads up, when I was a kid we had a very similar situation. One day the patio door opened, cat bolted out the door and ran after the fox chasing it into the woods.

Cat never came back. :(
My cat screams extremely loudly and attacks everything when he sees animals outside lol, glad you get the purr!
The fox is waiting for you to follow it to a shrine.
That‚Äôs very cool. Thanks for sharing.
Word of advice: As tempting as it may be, NEVER open the window to let the fox indoors. Speaking from personal experience.
Such a pointy faced outside cat
[deleted]
I just realized something. I'd love to have a "yard fox". They'd cull all the destructive creatures that damage a home. Rats. Mice. Squirrels. Raccoons. Possum. Pigeons. Symbiotic in a way. Farmers adopt feral cats for this exact reason.
I have read that cats purr at a frequency which promotes healing in bones and tissue, which is why they purr when they're injured. They will also seek out other familiar cats to purr with them in such cases. I wonder if that has any bearing on why your cat feels the desire to purr while the fox sleeps there? I mean, obviously we probably won't ever know and I'm sure it's just your kitten being super cute and friendly, but it's nice to imagine your kitten thinking they're being helpful. ‚ô°
Well, what does it say?
Foxes are cat software running on dog hardware. Perhaps the kitten is just recognizing a kindred system on the network?
That fox found a safe place to sleep. With his great hearing, he can probably hear kitty purring and it's relaxing. But please don't let kitty outside so it doesn't become fox food.
Romeo and Juliet
That Fox wants to eat the kitten. üôÅ
The fox scent will drive the cat crazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy!
I wonder what her reaction would be if she could smell the fox through the window? I'm guessing that she imagines that the fox smells like a cat and she'd be miffed and offended to find out it smells weird.
I'm currently nursing my cat after a fox attacked him. He's had 2 operations and is feeling very sorry for himself with his cone of shame on. You don't want your cat to be unafraid of foxes.
Time to setup the FoxCam!
Sequel to ‚ÄúThe Fox and the Hound‚Äù: The Fox and the Feline~
Any plans on building a little sleeping shelter for the fox in that corner
A fox is a cats soul in a dog's body
One of my cats (a Siamese too) was very badly bitten by a fox so do watch out. That friendship may be very one-sided.
So sweet, but kinda makes me sad that wild animals don‚Äôt have any left natural habitat to feel safe and can nap instead they are forced to find shelter within humans and not all are nice people.
Illegal levels of adorable
That fox will eat the kitten.  Fox will be foxes.  They are all beautiful but dangerous.  Just like raccoons
Fox is playing some form of long con guaranteed
That fox would love a scrap of carpet to sleep on outside the window.
I love foxes!
Don't let your cat outside, that fox has put in some time for that meal.
It's lovely
Someone‚Äôs got a crush
is it odd that hearing that purring sound is relaxing to me ?

it is like a drug or something.

pretty cat btw OP.
Cute video, but I would double check to make sure there is no way for the fox to get inside (ie. doggie door).
Ye that cat will be eaten now it trusts foxes. Be careful
[https://www.angelfire.com/hi/littleprince/framechapter21.html](https://www.angelfire.com/hi/littleprince/framechapter21.html)

""You must be very patient," replied the fox. "First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . ."

"It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox. "If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you . . . One must observe the proper rites . . ."
Its all fun and games until the fox comes in and get a personality change
Until one day the kitten is let out and the fox gets the meal he's been waiting for
The quick brown fox... sleeps next to the lazy cat.
It feels safe there üíó
You realize that foxes have cat software running on dog hardware, right? Cat souls meeting and recognizing each other :)
Okay so what does the fox say?
Yes, it's cute, but that fox wants to eat that kitten. lol
She‚Äôs in love!
Very cute, but remember foxes are verrrrrrrrrry smart, cunning, patient animals and he might well just be waiting for the day you open that window.
She‚Äôs in love
Carfox, keeps asking cat for VIN number.
Y‚Äôall see friendship, the fox see lunch
Cute and all... but don't let that cat outside. That fox will probably eat it.

At least you don't have to worry about any pesky chickens in your yard :)
Are you by any chance a Disney princess?
100% that fox hears her purring!
Some of these comments are a lot.

But this was extremely cute!
I learned recently that cats don‚Äôt just purr when they are happy or content.

They also purr when nervous or scared.

Not saying that‚Äôs the case here, but interesting nonetheless (at least to me).  You know your own bag of knives better than I do.
The quick brown fox sleeps in front of the lazy cat.

Ummm you guys do know that purring isn‚Äôt always a happy noise. It can be for happiness yes but it can also be for worried scared or stressed so don‚Äôt always think of it as positive. I‚Äôm my eyes and yes, I do own cats, the cat is scared of the fox not happy and friendly about  it. Just please take this comment on board :)

Leave it an egg for breakfast next time hehe
Is that kitty called Evie?
I love this
Oh, there's a taste of her here, great!
I want what you got, I won't bite, promise.
Last winter I had a fox come up to my window a few times at night, and my cat would go beserk every single time. I've never seen her like this before or since then, not even with other cats. The fox was super nonchalant, didn't even mind me very much when I came to the window to check out what had her in a tizzy. Just slowly limped away after a few moments.
i think i had same species of a cat (looks exactly like yours), he was like 17y when i truely experienced wonders of cat defending his territory. now he wanted out after seeing the fox thru the window. and this fox wasnt scared and was kind of playful and curious. but after while the cat just ran the fox off to the forest, cat returned with small dancy steps with furriest tail i had ever seen him have. i was kinda amazing. i was really just afraid even letting him outside but couldnt handle the meowing, thinking hes way too old, probably deaf. that probably explained how he lived to 18y as outdoor cat too.
So the kitten is purring but what did the fox say?
Now that's something special. Lovely moment
That fox has a really nice coat.  We have coyotes that hang out near our backyard.  Our cat is definitely staying an inside cat.
That fox knows exactly what its doing.
Beautiful

The cat was purring but what did the fox say?
It‚Äôs waiting for that window to open for some fresh free cat .
I feel like this is a couple that was reincarnated as a Fox and a cat and they finally found each other
‚ÄúThe Fox and the Meows‚Äù
That fox looks much prettier and cleaner than the ones I see over in Tennessee. They're pretty notorious for finding their way around the neighborhood using storm drains. One was taking a nap on the sidewalk a few weeks ago (he got up as I drove by so I know he was sleeping). This guy looked disgusting, and I bet he smelled even worse lol
Reminds me of juniperfox on insta
Cats also purr to calm themselves down..
She's getting Fox news updates!
As others have said, do not let them in contact with each other. However, having observed my cat (when he was about 4) rolling around playing with a red fox - grabbing its belly, riding on its back, chasing each other‚Ä¶fox intentions aren‚Äôt always carnivorous. 

But yeah, not a risk worth taking. I stopped letting my cat outdoors when I moved away from the countryside. Now, ten years later, I would never such a situation occur.
Fox would eat that cat if it had a chance.
‚ÄúIs this like a kitty vending machine? I‚Äôll wait here until it comes out‚Äù
It's hungry and wants to eat it.
Romeo & Juilet
Looks like the cat has a crush on someone :))))))
Aww mate, i wish we ll have more foxes in our forest too
I've never seen a fox sleep like that before. Why are they so cute?!!
Let that fox in
Jesus Christ, why isn‚Äôt this a movie yet. I don‚Äôt mean something like this, we have fox and the hound. 

I mean why haven‚Äôt we made a movie about *this* cat and *this* fox?

Edit: fixed a wildly inappropriate typo.
Adopt the Fox
They‚Äôre nap buddies!
We could really learn a lot from animals. This is amazing üòç
This seems like the start of a Disney movie
The Fox and the Feline.

Coming to theaters near you.
I used to live in the ground floor flat in London. And there was a fox, a lady fox and she was hanging out with my male cat. She was barking and waiting under the window until the cat get out... it was interesting to watch them disappearing into the bushes...
That‚Äôs just not fair. You have a kitty with a fox as a best friend‚Ä¶ you lucky duck.
The love that dare not speak its name!  So cute!
Da purringks!!!
I think somebody wants dinner
Next Beastars season
You could sneak a flea treatment onto the back of it's neck...

Hope the fox ain‚Äôt hungry!
She has a crush, clearly
"hi you are a very strange looking fox but I like you and we should be friends, I'm taking a nap now"
She‚Äôs got a crush on the tough guy from the other side of town....
That fox sure does love sleeping next to its food.

this is too adorable! wish my kitty had a fox friend to snooze nearby T_T
This made my day. Thank you OP
Wow! üòç You have the best window in the entire world‚ÄîI‚Äôm sure of it! I don‚Äôt assume you‚Äôd ever sell your house with a window like that, but if you do‚Äîbe sure to tell prospective buyers that you have a window that a is bed for a beautiful fox. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll increase your property value by thousands!
for a wild fox that thing is well groomed.
No audio?
Crack the window! Not high enough for her paw to get through‚Ä¶just wide enough for them to smell and hear each other! I would love to see a follow up video of them interacting!
What a beautiful fox,  beautiful cat too
WTF I want a window fox too
Does Save a Fox know about this cuteness??? She would be on cloud nine.
Awww, kitty is a fox-kin! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Cat is probably purring as a comfort mechanism, rather than happiness. The predator is causing it stress and so it's trying to make itself calmer, cats purr for a lot of reasons, there's even some speculation that they purr to humans to achieve the same effects it has on themselves.
Aww they love each other.
Recently read ‚Äúfoxes are what you get when you run cat software on dog hardware‚Äù and that seemed about right
The kitty purrs, but what does the fox say?
Could it be that the fox is hungry to eat a kitten?
That fox definitely wants to eat that cat.
Aww!

They both think they're watching *Animal Planet*...
Friends my butt! If that indoor kitty gets outside Swiper gets a snack!
Adorable
Look at that engine purr
Both gorgeous!
How lovely, they are friends üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
The Fox and The Feline‚Ä¶
Foxes are dog hardware running cat software.
The purring is because the fox is a Cuteness Rival for the human's attention; *i.e.* don't look at that, look only at me, see my charming-ness, it's far superior, and I don't stink as much while I rub my 'ownership' all over you.
Except that fox will take that kitty's head off in a split second and not leave a trace. Fox is just guarding her prey.
Poor cat is lonely
All owned cats need to be indoors unless you have a farm. 

Outdoor cats in a town or city setting it just a way of saying "I'm a lazy, inconsiderate fuck who can't be bothered to look after my own pet". They're a disease to local ecosystems and a pest to neighbors who incur property damage from other people's cats.

Can you imagine if dog owners just opened their doors at night for their pets to go wild on other people's stuff? They would rightly have their pet taken and be fined.
This is the sweetest thing I have seen in ages!
It would eat the cat so quickly. It's just waiting lol
LET THEM BE FRIENDS, OP.
One day both will be missing, be careful
The fox is just waiting for the window to open and it has lunch
Open that window and see how much the fox loves the cat
The world would be a better place if this was all that was on the TV during ‚ÄúFox and friends‚Äù
Fun fact. Foxes and cats are so alike they have been known to attempt to breed with eachother.
Wake up folks.  A wild fox has no good intentions toward your pets.  It smart and vicious. Your cat is prey.

I have a red fox that lives near me, I have yet to get a decent picture of it.   But when it comes near the house the (indoor only) cats make chirpy noises at it, which are supposed to be friendly.   The fox never reacts to them though.

She was actually singing "what does the fox say."
I think cats can purr when they're particularly afraid to calm themselves down too...but she otherwise doesn't seem particularly afraid of the fox.
Fox wants to eat the cat.  I watched a fox frolick and act silly in front a prairie dog (rodent) hole.  It was trying to charm its prey into watching it, letting their guard down so the prey is easy to catch.

So who does the voice overs for the animaromcom?
Your cat is trying to tell the fox that inside it's nice and warm. She purrs loudly so the fox can hear it through the window. It's really a power move more than anything else.
