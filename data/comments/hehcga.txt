She is gorgeous! Omg, what a face, perfect love and perfect trust.
Anytime I see a person with tattoos & their baby, I'm always so surprised that the baby doesn't have tattoos like its parent. And then I remember it doesn't work like that.

Edit: Thank you for my first awards kind strangers!
That smile says *"I have a surprise for you."*
Grandpa here. She is beautiful. Enjoy these days, they fly so quickly.
God I remember when my daughter was that tiny, I couldn't get enough of playfully munching that under-chin, she's three now and when she was a few months old I'd tell her ' Is that where you hide the chocolate ????' Every day when I come home she tells me 'daddy I DON'T HAVE ANY CHOCOLATE !!! I tell her LIES !!!! I need to check, much giggling and toddler farts ensue ...
That is a moment of crystalline love and connection and is so wonderful <3
I wonder what it feels like to be a mother and have your baby smile at you while squeezing you finger with their tiny hands. One of the most beautiful things on earth is the deep, unconditional  love (most) mothers have for their children. I find it fascinating.

Your baby is super cute OP, I'm sure she'll grow up to be a good, kind-hearted human. Enjoy the ride!


Edit: SO MANY happy mothers. It genuinely feels me with warmth. I'm so happy for all of you and your lucky babies
that smile is responsible for global warming and increased face melting, so adorable. Bless that little pumpkin.
What a sweetheart. So beautiful!
She’s gorgeous. And making me have to punch my ovaries back to sleep.
Absolutely beautiful! Enjoy every moment
How is your baby more photogenic than me? The world is unfair... here's an updoot
Wow. I'm one of these people who feel like  99% of babies are butt ugly lookalikes, that you have to be related to to find them cute, but now this is an objectively cute and adorable baby with puppy eyes full of malice and love and incredible expression. She's gonna be a little actress I bet!
Marry that woman!!! You make beautiful babies and the love on that little ones face is precious!💗
So god damn cute!
Great moment!

She 6 months?
This is the one in a million picture.. cuteness all over...
That smile will own you for the rest of your life.  Good luck EVER saying no to it!
It just doesn’t get any more beautiful than this. This moment right here. You’ll never look at your daughter the same. When my husband got that first big smile that was just for him, he broke down crying. I knew at that point that he had bonded with our adopted daughter. He swore that day that he would take the life of any person that tries to take that smile. She is his entire world and he is hers. I’ve never seen a father/daughter bond so strong. I love it.
She just pooped and she knows you haven't smelled it yet.
Adorable!
Holy cow, that's fantastic.
Off the cute scale 💯
That’s the face my little sister makes when she gets bashful
Wow what a fantastic picture! What phone was this taken with? My wife is desperate for a new phone to take beautiful pics like this of our daughter.
Oh my goodness so cute
oh my GOD this is cute
Is this the same baby as the video "6 months old realizing you don't have anything to worry about"?
cant unsee mustache tattoo
Don't post your kids online. Just my opinion. You can't control who sees the picture an what they do with it. And especially regarding that this is reddit, you might not want your child's face on here. 
To clarify what I'm saying: I'm just taking a dump while watching your child. If that's okay, so it'll be by me but you can't really ask a baby for permission, right?
What a sweet little face.
So beautiful. Bringing her up, protecting her, feeding her, and all round taking care of this precious little baby is going to be the most important thing you'll ever do.
Very, very, cute >~<
Enjoy those moments they definitely grow up too fast.  Blink and she’s 17 moving away for college.

“Yeah I’m cute”
Cute bannie.

Cheek kisses! 😚
Such cutie!
This is going to be one of those pictures that really lines up with what her adult face looks like.
Babies aren't cute and you can't change my mind.
That smile must be protected at all costs
"Manly squealing" That is godsdamned adorable!
She’s SOOOO CUTE 😍
Shes so freaking cute it makes it makes my ovaries hurt 🤗

She's so beautiful! Like an old soul.
My goodness, what a gorgeous smile.
Oh God she is so sweet 😍
Lmao you’re so done dude
Daaame daaaaame, you guys are so lucky. I wish you a lifetime of happiness.
My stone cold hearts melted. Dam you to a wonderful life gorgeous girl
Scritches passed along as requested, until she flipped like a pancake for an upgrade to belly rubs.

Our girl knows the secret to trading-up in every area of her life!
Aww perfect photo shes beautiful. This is the daddy's wrapped around my finger already smile.
She didn't get the tattoos, are you sure she's yours?
My guess is she’ll be one of those babies that look the same way when she’s a child and adult. You’ll get to see that expression her whole life and that’s wonderful!
She's cuuute take as as many as you can. The first year goes waaaaay too fast.
Smiles make the world go around!
What a truly gorgeous little sweetie. Enjoy!
Omg the prettiest!!!
Damn. She already has you wrapped around her finger! I have three little girls, it is sweet.
Omgoodness that's such an adorable picture and adorable baby hehe. Congratulations!

Breakfast in bed

As a guy who found out this month that I won't be a Dad because of the complications of my fiancee's brain tumor .. this makes me cry ..I'm sure you will treasure your child . I hope she carry's that smile throughout her whole life 🙂
That is such a great picture. That smile and the fact that they are holding hands. Just perfect
Aww, I literally said “Aww” out loud. This is too cute! She’s so precious! ♥️♥️♥️
What a beautiful baby you two have! She is very photogenic. I must say, that is a badass tattoo momma has.
You should frame this picture and hang it up

Happy happy wee thing.

Enjoy every moment.
look at that cheeky smile!!
That is a picture you will always cherish! That smile, that look, all of it!

I have one of my son when he was 8 months old, in his car seat, in the back of our car; it was just me and him, I turned around, and snapped one of my favorite pictures of him to this day. He's nearly 9 now. It goes by fast.
[deleted]
She is one cute baby.
How old is she? What a cutie!! Baby smiles are the best!! :-)
What a beautiful lil nugget!
I find this picture very soothing. Your baby is saying: *things are going to be okay*.
She is going to be a happy and sweet child
Beautiful picture!
My heart is melting! Beautiful baby! Hi cutie!
Congratulations on your beautiful girl 😍😍
What a lovely photo!
That pic is unbelievable! A real showstopper.
What a beautiful child. You can see the love in her eyes.
So precious! You are blessed!
That is a beautiful pic. I'd frame it.
Ah yes, that wonderful stationary phase before every photo is just a vaguely child shaped blur.
/r/Aww really sucks, Marge.
I'm loving all these babies lately. About to have my first and with as much anxiety that this comes with, it's just so nice to see these pure moments. 

She is beautiful.
Cool tattoo
WOW ! Beautiful...
I was having a pretty bad day but when i saw this it made my day much much better.
[removed]
Those eyes!
She's so precious! Great pic!
So very precious
She’s absolutely beautiful!
Awwww so precious!!
Beautiful
That is one CUTE baby!
She is so beautiful
So. Damned. CUUUUUUTE! 

Take my upvote!
She is a doll!! Bring on the baby fever! Also tattoo fever 😍😍
Omg too much cuteness <3 congrats OP
  
Edit: Controversial comment talking about babies. Ok reddit. Was it the heart or the "omg"? I don't even type like that it was an honest reaction to the cuteness :(
Omg I think I have Diabetes now. Too sweet!
I'm too broke to be baby crazy but my gosh she is adorable
Wow that's a moment right there x
My wife and I fully agree that our two are plenty for us. We also agree that your little girl made us for a moment consider having another... So flipping cute!!!!
Beautiful smile
Seggs!!! Before marriage!!!! Noooo!
Tell your lady she has a dope tattoo. Your baby is precious!
Oh my stars 😍❤️
she smiles with her eyes, that's so precious!!
can't get any better
Beautiful.
Omg so precious
What a stinkin cute baby!!
So freaking precious omg
That smile could light up a room
Cutie patootie.
Omg !!! I’m melting!!!
I wish to wake up in the morning seeing my own child smiling like this someday.
Oh my word, that baby has the most beautiful face. I would never be able to say no to whatever she wanted!! <3
Ohhhhh my God what an angel!!!!! Congrats to you both!
😊- me rn after seeing that
Ok I usually hate every newborn potato that is posted here, but this is pretty damn cute.
That hand tattoo is sick. Also that baby has some supermodel vibes going on with that pose lol
Awww....what an angelic smile! She is such a beautiful baby ! God bless you all !❤
Aww she's gorgeous!!
Made my day.
Beautiful
Sweetest baby ever!!
What a cutie! :) She’s doing the finger grab thing I love (when a baby grabs a finger with their whole little hand); sweet baby :D
Super cute pic, but I don't understand why everyone who takes a good picture tries to downplay it and act aloof, saying they "managed to snap" a pic like they didn't mean to do it. I mean, there was time to focus as there is depth of field. It's a cute pic, [but it makes me think of this](https://i2.wp.com/bemethis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/_2.jpg?fit=650%2C975&ssl=1).
That is the cutest baby picture I have ever seen!! :o

Thank you for sharing. ♥
This is the most adorable baby picture ever! That sweet loving little smile is too much.
Your little girl is impossibly beautiful. And this is a studio-quality photograph. Thank you for sharing this with us.
😍
She is beautiful ❤️
Absolutely stunning genuine smile, just the sweetest to see!
I might not have kids but this an adorable picture.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER BABY IN MY FEED
Omg that smile! So sweet! 😍😁❤
Sweet little girl!
She's beautiful, very beautiful
hey there, precious sunshine. may you have an amazing life, full of love, health, laughter and joy.
Aww shes beautiful!!! Congrats!
How cute, 

Already spreading love and melting hearts on reddit.
That expression!! There’s so much in it that it makes me think she’s an old soul that hasn’t forgotten all her former lives.
What a beautiful squishy
She is going to be a beauty, isn't she?
When I opened the picture, I first saw the mom's hand and somehow expected the baby to be tattooed.

What a lovely kid.
wow look at that smile!! beyond precious
This picture is awwesome.
Definitely farting.
When looking at very young babies sometimes I get the impression that they know things. They forget them by the time they learn to talk, but oh... I think this baby knows things.
Damn that is one hell of a smile
Omg I’m in love. Look how precious and sweet that little face is🥺
She looks like she’s gotta tell you something exciting
Aww that's just adorable 🥰
That is adorable! 109% pure love in the hand and the baby
It's gas dude.
This is what cameras were made for.
Such a sweet pea!
Absolutely adorable bro congrats protect that angel 👼
awe she’s absolutely beautiful !!
this is so so so adorable. she is so beautiful and looks so precious!
So beautiful! You’re a lucky guy
Oh my word, she's perfect 😍😍
That’s an iconic photograph!  It shows a baby fully at peace and aware of being unconditionally loved.
What a beauty
*This* is a good lookin' baby!  She's just gorgeous!
That's definitely an "Oh, you!" expression.
Shes so cute
That’s adorable!
That's some nice art there! Sorry first thing I noticed 😭
Awwww😻😻😻
Between that cute baby and that awesome hand tattoo, this should be made into a portrait on Fracture.me, for real. It’s pictures printed on glass and it’s an amazing technique for keepsake photos. 

At least hang up a printed copy of this though bare minimum haha.
Great, now for a million ridiculously photogenic baby memes.  (Seriously, cute kid!)
THATS SOOOO CUTE
Adorable
She is beautiful!!!
Oh she is just divine!
Precious ❤️
I logged into both my accounts so I could upvote twice
Managed, to choose the best picture out of 10000 that were taken that morning.
They’re gonna look back on this picture in twenty years and say ‘yep, still makes the same face ‘ :)
What a beautiful happy baby.  Look at those eyes...you can see the happiness and trust there.  Enjoy these days.  They seem to grow up so fast.
"I know You Love Me"

 😍😍😍
Precious
That is an extremely cute kid. Congrats!
You need to blow that up and put in on canvas!!! That picture makes my heart melt! I use canvaspeople.com
I'm not usually struck by such pictures but this is beautiful.
What a sweetheart!
So adorable
world class photo. should enter it in something
I  (f) am not maternal at all nor do I go crazy for  babies. They have to be exceptional for me to say they are cute, and this little lady is the cutest thing I've ever seen!!
That loving smile made a bad day brighter. Thank you for sharing this beauty. :)
That is a beautiful picture. Congratulations on a beautiful baby; best wishes.
She is beautiful!
Omgosh I want to “boop” that sweet lil button nose. How adorable
That will be your favorite picture for decades.
That is a knowing smile. She knows how much she is loved!
This should be a stock photo they use to sell picture frames.
Put that baby on a diaper box!!
Years from now, you’ll be able to look back with her & see how that smile was always *her* smile. She’s so beautiful!
Amazing picture. She's a beauty!
Oh my god she's so adorable!
Beautiful pic
It’s the Ridiculously Photogenic Baby^TM
Adorable. Bitchin tattoo as well.
That twinkle in her eye is adorable. I can hear her thinking "i got you and you know it."
Such an angelic smile. So much innocence.
What a perfect picture! So amazing to live in an age where we have technology now that allows is to capture small moments like this to be remembered forever!
That’s super cute!
This is such an amazing picture! Love that you caught her smile!!! Awe a moment held paused in time for ever, this is so perfect!
This will be your kid's favorite baby photo growing up! Such personality!!
Ah,cutie patootie
What a picture! Beautiful
So cute. Well done.
Awwwwwwwwwwwww that is frame and wall worthy. She is beautiful!
This face just made my day 🥺🥺🥰
Now that is a charming smile. Being a parent is indescribable.
Such a sassy smile!!! She’s the cutest baby. Congratulations!
The sweetest smile!!
This is definitely the future face of can I please have some ice cream- once she can eat ice cream and verbalize a request. She’s already got the cute face game, next is talking and walking.
If I had a daughter and she looked at me like that I'd be done she would get everything she ever wanted as I would be her puppet.
That picture is a keeper! I'll bet she uses that look on you throughout her lifetime. Keep this picture handy. And, if you really want to have some fun with it, show it to her date for the prom in about 18 years! 😆
How do babies know to smile at such a young age? Is that just instinctive?
Oh she’s perfect!
So adorable 😍
Absolutely beautiful and congratulations.
Whelp, that one is going to have to be framed and put up on your wall.
I'm having baby fever and this post isn't helping. Too cute!
It's just gas.
I need to squeeze those cheeks..........
I'm smiling, because of her cute smile.
*baby stando?*

This is beautiful! Thanks for sharing.

Cherish every minute. Don’t work away from home if you can help it. 
You’ll look back on this as the most beautiful time of your life. 
...every second. 
Consider being the richest person in the world and your baby is poorly?
What would you give to make her well?
If our children are well we’re lottery winners every day ✌️❤️

Wow that tattoo is just awful
Awwww❤️
Oh god, my ovaries weren’t ready for this. <3 

Edit: added the heart, it meant i think this baby is extremley cute and makes me want one but im not ready for one yet.. pls stop downvoting?
Tattooed women with babies, one of my favorite photography subjects. Hopefully we can change the society norms of body modifications
Welp, this sub is dead. Stop upvoting babies.
[deleted]
What a beauty!  And look at those eyes-she’s a smart one!
She's so beautiful! ❤️ That precious smile
My ovaries hurt
[removed]
This is beautiful!! Seriously I'm jealous. I want a pic this sweet of my baby girl lol
What an adorable little angel she is. 
My heart just melted with that smile.

This makes me rethink hating babies. *Brings 4 in off balcony*
Awwwww ❤️❤️❤️ She’s so cute!🥰
Congratulations, she’s adorable!!
O.M.G. That’s such a good picture! What a sweetie.
Never lose this photo.  She is going to love it when she's older
Beautiful baby. Hope I am as luck as you if ever I have a child.
Isnt this the baby I just saw on the post "what it feels like to wake up without a care in the world"?
She has a pretty smile! Good work!
She’s beautiful !!
Sooooo cuuuuteeee
This is so lovely. Beautiful baby, beautiful hand clasp, just a wonderful photo all the way around.
Omg, what a beautifully perfect picture. She’s a doll!
This is the best picture of a baby that I've ever seen. Ever.
This baby is GORGEOUS!
Cheeks!
Wow that's a cute baby.
Good lord, the cutest of cuteness!
Yeah yeah cute baby sure

Is that a James O'Barr crow on her hand?!
Such a beautiful baby. Typically I find babies gross and avoid them but she looks so pretty
Oh my cutenessss!
Omg cutenesses OVERLOAD!  She is so gorgeous!
Melt my heart
Oh, my absolute goodness... My heart!!! 😭😍
And what a pose!! Beautiful.
This baby is so sweet she deserves her own sub...SBITW, Sweetest Baby In The World! !🤗
Man, I don't even like babies but this is a cute baby.
Hahahahahahaha
So cute, is the tatoo on the hand the mother?
If I wasn't too much of an asshole this would have convinced to have kids lol. Beautiful baby, wish her all the health in the world.
I dislike babies but this is kinda making it seem okay 🥺
r/mirin
These are best of times dad. Enjoy every minute even when you are sleep deprived and exhausted. Once they are gone they are gone. Congratulations! your little one is precious. 👼
Thats a cute lil baby :)
Might I be a little nosy and ask why you guys aren't engaged and/or married?
This is beautiful and everything, but I believe everyone is sub consciously wondering who is on the tattoo on the hand.
Another baby, keep this shit off Aww

Not as cute as an animal
He's so cute i'll like he much❤️
[deleted]
I’m a 33 year old woman without a maternal bone in my body. I’m generally unaffected by babies. They’re just not interesting or cute to me. 

...but this gorgeous little girl just made me actually utter “awwwww!!” out loud. 

I think I might have felt an ovary twitch for half a second. 😅
Aww ♥️ she's such a pretty girl 🍀
Are w sure that isn't proffesional? That's a really good picture with really good quality.
[removed]
I'm never gonna have children :(
You two have made a beautiful baby.
That is one of the best pictures ever taken IMHO. She’s gorgeous!
You know when you see something so nasty you think you're gonna be sick? This is the opposite, I think I just puked a rainbow.
I would not put my baby or grandbahy on the Reddit. Too many hackers these days. My husband's computer was hacked and now naked women with there areolas showing are always on his email

Also tattoo could scare the baby
Aw! She's extremely photogenic:) And I bet she's videogenic as well...
Your baby girl is ADORABLE! 
Giving me baby fever - must resist!

Beautiful baby girl and what a sweet smile!
Made my day 💖
not even a year old and she's snatching hearts.
What an absolute Beauty!! Oooh, my ovaries!
I also want a baby like this in the future with someone I have loved right now🥰❤️ but it is impossible.
I scrolled all the way down and saw all these people saying babies aren’t as cute as a animal not true people who wanna post their kids on r/aww go ahead there are people who find them adorable.

When people have babies, how are you guys not married
With a tattoo that trashy, I wouldn't get your hopes up for the kid
Oh my goodness. I just got myself preggers

Judging by that tattoo you should probably not be bringing sapient beings into this world.
Get your nasty baby human off r/aww. What the fuck, hasn't there been discussions about this nonsense? BABY ANIMALS NOT CHILDREN.
Your wife?
He's taking a shit, you just know it.
Cute baby; gross tat
Put a ring on it
Love her

So like, there is a deluge of cute baby pictures on the front page of /aww right now. Is our government concerned that with all this protesting and pandemic stuff our reproduction numbers are going to sink even lower? So here you go all you ovulating women, it's baby making time YOU KNOW YOU WANT ONE
With what, a fucking $1000 camera?
congrats, you reproduced a kid that will most likely be suffering greatly due to climate change in 30 years. so did everybody else.
gross. you know it has big eyes so you won't eat it?
Cute kid --- too bad

Cute pic but why tf she sleeps with a dslr in bed tho ?
That smile is, "When are you going to propose to mommy, daddy?"
i know this will get downvoted but dont put ur crotch goblins on r/aww
Sheesh, your girlfriend not your wife???   /s
I think by the time you have a baby together, it becomes more appropriate to say partner.
Please get married, and stop sleeping around and eventually leaving this beautiful child.
