“I’m more of a SEAL than you’ll ever be!”
“I don’t have to outswim the Orca’s, just you.”
Pretty sure the navy SEALs are tagging along with the baby sea lion.
"200 burpees for smiling at the baby sea lion!" 

"AND WHO IN THE FUCK SAID 'AWWH!' GODDAMNIT MEN!"
[deleted]
Little seal melted me when he did his little zoom....like he was just so fucking excited.
This is his chance being with the big boys, he better seal the deal.
Sgt. Flippers will be instructing you today.
Man all you big seals are so slow in the water.
 Its neal mcbeal the navy seal!
Just a couple of Buds going to BUD/S
I’m your mascot, guys! Look I’m your mascot!
“C-130 rollin’ down the strip-ah,
SEAL team froggy gonna take a little trip”
Imagine the navy seals using actual seals like attack dogs
It looks so excited!! Yay  finally someone to play with!
Just a couple of seals out for a morning swim.
This is probably a stupid question, but...where are they all going? Do they always just charge directly into a body of water?
Are you guys gonna go see my friend baby shark?  Watch out for his dad tho.
where’s it’s mom :(
Where are they going though.
Those bois never skip leg day
All those seals have nice bums
The real SEAL.
“I WANNA BE

THE VERY BEST”
Loose seal!  Watch out for loose seal!
I hope he does well in his best mission to exterminate the south american drug fueled regime.
God bless you Baby Seal
Next he'll write a book about  it.
r/petthedamndog
This is so cute!
Debby Downer here, so that pups mom left it on the beach while she swam off to find food for her and her pup while these "Seals" coax the pup into the water. Sad
Now let me see your war face!
"Todays instructor is...."  
"Follow me humans!! i will teach you how to seal!!"
'Negative soldier, you can't bring him'
'But sir, it's almost his feeding time'
he's SO happy! "hey guys, where we goin? what are we gonna do now???"
Day 12, they still haven't noticed I'm not a hooman.
Pet the damn water dogo....
Seals now enlist actual seals, more at 11
>**A baby sea lion** **~~trying~~** **succeeding to tag along with the Navy SEALs**
Bad ass soldier...
Must not pet baby seal...

Bad Ass Soldier...
Most Not Pet Baby Seal...

BAD! ASS!
MOST! NOT! UGHHHH!!!
Dam no one even pet him
Don’t pet it don’t pet it. - the SeALs likely.
"I haz a naval! Where we goin?"
"my dad told me about you guys"
You can almost hear "Dad, I wanna come with you"
“What do you mean I can’t come? Your group literally has seal in the name!”
"I'm a Navy Seal trainer."

"Oh wow, you were in the special forces?"

"I don't think you understand."
When imprinting goes horribly, horribly wrong.
Look out it’s a loose seal!
Lucille! Loose seal!
Loose Seal! Loose Seal!!!!
Are they wearing socks?;0
It's funny because they're all so miserable right now and the seal is just playing and happy as can be.
Must have been such a morale booster. Feeling miserable, tired as hell, cold as a witch's teet, and have to run into the ocean, but seeing that little guy happily flopping along must have made it a little bit better.
“Where are we going? Is it time to play??”-seal
We love you for your help in defending our nation.
Seal says, " lets see what that whale thinks about my backup"
Not to be pedantic, but its a sea lion.
He's just following his family.
Oh I adore this
"Let's just get in the water and we'll see who's leading"
Doggos of the sea
Thank god someone was finally smart enough not to call it a seal
Navy SEAL seal :3
Me a seal too!
Aquamen
OG seal.
You know what is missing from this picture correct?

Do it, reddit. Do it.
Adorable!!!
They really are the dogs of the sea aren’t they? He’s like a little puppy.
Why's noone petting him?😢
More like taggin' dem asses right guys? haaha... ha..  guys?
It’s the little guy rolling with the homies.

That’s their mascot
Those guys didn't skip leg day.
Just say seal. Sounds better.
So cute !🥺🤩😊

With the Navy Seals gray wetsuits, little seal is thinking "oh, look, they look just like me".
MERMAID PUPPY
Please someone tell me they were aloud by instructors and the seal itself to pet it lol
Those recruits look younger every year.
He wishes he was a seal so he could fit in
That looks so cold
“So when you see me on the real , formin like Voltron remember i get deep like a NAVY/BABY Seal”

Hahaha it's a seal tagging along with the Navy Se- oh it's already done in the title
Come on man who been training Navy SEALs !!
I see whatcha did there
Reporter: "The sea Lion no longer a pup graduated at the top of his class with full Honors. He later retired with 300 confirmed kills".

Reporter: "truly a inspiration to us all. On other news marine biologist are baffled at the sudden disappearance of the Orca population. Investigation is on going but so far have no leads.
Wrong kind of SEAL my little buddy
True stimulus...
He just wants to learn how to write a book about his life
Let's club him, like a real seal
r/flippyflaps
There’s a baby sea lion? I missed it because I was admiring the all the bums and calves. 🥰
Alright this SEALed the deal I want to be a navy SEAL
But why you guys wearin’ all that stuff and carrying shit?  I can just dive right in all by myself!
Someone out there is already storyboarding an anime based on this clip
Looks cute, but that little sea lion is under some pretty hefty war crimes charges for things he did in Fallujah.
Me. When I graduated engineering school and joined my first team..
Poor sea lion, it doesn’t know how much they’re destroying it’s habitat
Ah my younger cousin Paul who always wanted to be a seal for some reason. Looks like he found a way to complete his dreams.   


At least until his mother gets her flippers on him!
Awh, lawd. The cuteness kills me!!!
A sea lion desperately  wishing they were a seal
That’s a good boi
This is no place for a hobbit
He's clearly the platoon sergeant
Something about one of the most deadly and professionally trained group is soldiers with a small baby seal as a mascot in training... It's awesome
Dose asses doe...
He is literally a Navy Seal lmao
I love this. Thank you.
What the fuck did you just say to me? You little bitch I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class as a seal.
A cute and inspiring mascot!
Which one is which?
Neil mcBeal
Jesus Christ the size of the dudes calves.
Awww that’s so cute!
Aww. He thinks he's people.
Neal Mcbeal's first day training
He heard the call
Awwww...just being one of the guys.
Tactical boi
"Guys! Guys! theres a shark out there turn around! GUYS! WHY IS NO ONE LISTENING TO ME!
As soon as they get in deep waters he'll swim circles around them.
The baby seal is so cute :)
The seal is just an undercover navy seal.
Damn! That’s a thick ass boy!
The real SEAL(ion)
omg precious baby, where is this?
Sorry kid.  Seals only.  Come back without ears.
"You think you can swim?  Watch this."
Hey is it possible to get 10k downvotes on reddit dot com?
"You're SEALs, go act like seals!"
The mascot is here to give the boys encouragement
Ayyyyy

Daaaaaang look at the calves on those guys!
Wrong species homie
Well I can get his confusion
This makes me so happy!
The fucking calves on those guys.
Baby Seals
Navy SEALionS. They definitly upgraded their arsenal over the past years. huh.
GIF’s that end too soon!! I would watch a whole documentary about this.
Dang, seals are THICK
AWWWWWW!!!!! Wait up guys!
Wow that's sexy
This would have been more perfect if it was a baby seal, but I’m not complaining.
Neal the navy seal
Ngl this made my day
That sea lion is the baddest mfer on that beach
he's gonna save the  world and end all wars!!!!!!!!
Just one of the guys lol
this is the purest thing on reddit rn :’)
It’s not a sea lion, it’s a SEAL.
Sugar cookies suck
He is also navy seal
If Eddie Gallagher was there he'd probably kick the poor little guy.
“Sea lion where are you going?”
“Iran, I have been drafted”
The correct title was “baby seal with navy seal”
Tag along?

He's the instructor, fool!
US BABY SEAL
Oh my fucking god!!!!!
I'm a seal too I'm a seal too I'm a seal too!!!!
My money’s on the seal 😂
It’s all fun until we see a SEAL unit with this seal as the killing machine we know he will be.
Cutest thing ever
He wants to be the first sea mammal US soldier, that’s why
Good thing none of them have clubs.
Colorized footage of seal training Navy Seals (1991).
He's doin' such a good job ;w;
There's only one professional swimmer here, boys. He was born for this.
Fantastic!!
Thats one heck of a seal of approval.
Exactly what I needed today
What.....what's everyone running from?
Do precious!
Great now the sea life wants to go to war for oil
A real team Mascot!
I mean
It's the hero Neil McBeal, the navy seal!
He is the best seal out there.
Neil Mc'Beals origin story.
For the second time today, this is a seal, not a sea lion..
Showin them how it’s supposed to be done
I like to imagine that no matter how hard they trained, how fit and how good they are at swimming. 

They will all be outpaced by this seal pup while he's just playing.
It just wants to fit in
Lol, cute little creature.
You've got it all wrong, he's the drill sergeant
A baby SEAL if you will.
So when you see me on the real, forming like Voltron, remember I go deep like a baby seal.
Went to the comment section looking for copper, but instead I found horse shit. Why the fuck are we talking about orcas...
That is not a sea lion, it’s a navy seal
They really are the puppers of the sea
"I'm doing my part too!"

*SEALs laughing*
Go get um soldier
The Navy actually trains seals and dolphins to identify things like mines and enemy water craft that may be lurking near their ships/subs.
Curious to see what the SEAL’s were doing
Not SEALs yet but rather candidates in BUDS.  They could give a shit about that seal. They're getting reading to do a long surface swim in some very cold water and have gone without sleep for days.
Little guy is a SEAL at heart
The sea lion that aspires to be a seal...awwwww
GET SOME!!!!!!
The navy seals should hire him/her i mean if your going to do special ops who better than an actual Seal. Now one would expect an actual seal to be part of the US navy.
A navy seal...
“Too war my brohters, the land and the sea shall be overs”
I’m thinking two things. Awwww! And my goodness those calves look tight. I just wanna get those bodies on my table and put in some work.
Well they're his inspiration , and vice versa 👍
Hey that's stolen valor 😆
Neal McBeal?
I'm safer with these ripped dudes!
I don't get it, is the seal actually in training?  I know the Navy utilizes some trained animals, like dolphins.
THAT’S SO PRECIOUS FJEKDJJD
He’s a seal SEAL
CAN I GET A HOOYAH?!

HOOY!Awwwwww.
#WHY IS HE SO CUTE
I’ll bet you he can swim farther, hold his breath longer while in colder water, then any of those guys.
Baby seal with navy seals
Im more disappointed the fact that the title didn’t say baby SEAL trying to tag along with the navy seals
" Make way for  Lieutenant Commander Flipper, I heard he killed a man with a single swipe of his flipper."
I was fully expecting one of them to try to kick it.
“WHY ARE YOU WALKING, SEALs?! LET’S MOVE IT!”
The Navy sure does take SEAL training seriously.
r/technicallythetruth
He's so positive because he's a SEAL ion.
" move your asses soilders i was born a seal you have yo earn the right to be one ,now move " 😂😂
Wet n sandy
And NOBODY is reaching down to pet it. WTH 

Probably better for the sea lion but...
Just wants to swim with its friends.
a SEALion
It's a Loose Seal!
Seal ready.
I consider myself a pretty jaded guy but this top posts in r/aww always manage to make me actually aww.
One of the guys
Looks so cold!
Or maybe the navy seal is following the seals command?
Navy seals use actual trained seals. He could be just one of the guys.
Nice one. I saw this post and thought the exact same thing, but you beat me to it
That’s one loose seal
“Hey guys! Hey what’s up? Can I hang? Can I hang? Can I- hawhdjksnwjsosslz”
I just imagine the Navy parks up off a coast all the seals jumped ship and swam to the beach to helpout with some important task then walked and swam back to their ship.

As normal as it sounds I just can’t shake the feeling of how funny it is.
Cute
"Wait, where are YOU guys going? Can I tag aling?"
So damn literal
I'm sure whatever they're about to do isn't gonna be fun.
That's just seally.

Once they get in the water, the training begins.  I hope those SEALs are ready.
Found the next Pixar movie about seals becoming seals for the greater good
Run buddy, RUN!

But did he pass?!?! Did he get his trident?!?!
They got the seal of greenlight

It's ok buddy I always mix up sea lions and seals too
Dad, Dad! Hold up.
any one of those dudes could kick my ass with one arm behind their back
Daddy, daddy, where are you!
“Are you my mom? Are YOU my mom?”
Might be a dumb question, but why are their wetsuits cutoff above the knee?
Does  the US military still use mascots? You can add this little guy to a long line of bulldogs, mules and Bucky Barneses.

Damn. Those are America's asses.
So they all have their bags in the left hand, does anyone know why?

I know the military has a reason for everything, is there a reason for this?
Who wouldn’t want to tag along
He’s the new recruit
Does anyone have the full video?
New Pixar movie about War Animals!
This needs to be a Pixar or DreamWorks movie. A sea lion trying to become a navy seal.
Just give him a chance, he is trying his best.

That is so cute

Trying? Pretty sure as soon as they're swimming the SEALs will be trying to tag along with the sea lion.
He's their new mascot!
Is it a sea lion in that film 8 below or whatever? 
With the dogs stranded on their own... Nonono the leopard seal.
That was a dick move ahah
Let’s see the navy seals tag along with him once he gets underwater.
“ONE OF US! ONE OF US!”
Come on guys, lest go!
He’s the leader
I once surfed with a lil fella like him, in Cromer in the UK
Is he not the cutest thing ever or what?!!!!! ❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕
This is the wrong sub for this I know, but does anyone know where we can find the sub for Corona info?
Let’s go guys!!!!!!

What are we doing?

Last one's in a rotten egg!
“You see, I’m somewhat of a SEAL myself.”

This is how I would wash out. Not the stress not the work load not the exaustion I would see a baby seal and stop and pet and feed and play with it until we are best friends
Poor little guy is *trying* to deliver a Cease and Desist but no one is taking him seriously for some reason.

“Give me back my name, assholes!”
Please someone hug and carry him.
A true navy seal!
Him going to save the wurld :)
Different seals training bud
I wish I could swim... 🥰

You want to see a seal, I'll show ya a seal!
I was about to say "THE TRUE SEAL" but realized that's a sea lion
Blessed post.

Dude, you're in the wrong pod.
I’m a seal too brothers...
Nah, hes showing them how it’s supposed to be done
That is so precious and adorable, but that baby seal better not go on an actual mission with those SEALS
When your level 1 but going on missions with your max level friends
he's doing his part!
We're all seals here, right guys?
We SEALS stick together
Pet him!
Not what I thought they meant by SEAL team

My... my goddamn fucking heart has ripped in twine.
That’s Navy Seal Neal McBeal

I smell a new Disney Pixar classic lol “an orphan baby seal who’s only dream in life is to become a Navy SEAL”
The cutest little drill sargent "C'MON! I CAN DO THIS WITH ONE FLIPPER BEHING MY BACK. MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!" If only he had his uniform.
so sad , a baby  seal  cannot survive  by  itself
Umm, but where are they going tho?
"I'm not trying to be pedantic. Why aren't any of you open to an honest debate about this?"
Peer pressures not cool.
Oh my! Look at those wee flippers justa going as fast as s/he could. Too cute!
How do these guys not pause when the ocean hits their junk!?
Dibs on muffins.
Lol, he's just like "hey fellas, where we going?"
He looks like their trainer and I love it!
Oh, you think the water is your ally, you merely adopted the water. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the beach until I was already an grown seal.

These boys are cold, and tired, and physically exhausted. This must have been the highlight of the year to see that little guy, and I bet they pushed into overdrive during that training session. So cool.
Well technically, he IS a seal.
Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Let’s go play!
He’s just teaching them how the job gets done
Baby SEALs
I could watch this all day.
Now that's  just wholesome
When you accidentally start following the wrong family at the supermarket
i have a friend that became a SEAL after highschool. he wasn't a big guy. he was pretty average sized and height, but he was athletic. he wrestled and played baseball. i remember being amazed when he told he became one and when he told me SEAL's  aren't these huge bulky guys.
Reminds me of r/petthedamndog except it would be “pet the damn seadog”
So cute
Lmao what is going on here are they just like going to walk into the ocean?
Still searching for that reeled in fish.
Those guys are hardcore they have the strength not to stop and play with it!
Okay, the SEALs need that sea pupper as their official mascot.
Seal team seal
Is his name Neal?
Gotta show my GF
Looks like he’s the captain and ordering them into the ocean cause he’s the real seal.
Poor guy just wants to be a seal.
That's adorble'
Dang. They truely are water dogs.
So cute
Look out! Loose seal!
Those big gray things kinda look like me! Where we going!?
I guess they have his "seal" of approval :)
“You think you’re tough? I do this shit every day”
Can i? Can i please be your mascot?
Looking for his/ her mom.  Very sad.
Those seals are thicc
“Come on, men!”
Most adorable TI ever 😍
Soldiers in skin tight wet pants jogging with a baby seal = female porn . Thank you for this.
this is the content i need right now 😭
Uhh no, that's their commanding officer
Ironic
Do not use if seal has been tampered with
The sheer discipline they have to not try and pet that lil guy.. no wonder I wouldn’t make it as a SEAL.
You can tell the difference between sea lions and SEALs due to their visible external ears.
I'd say he qualifies
the little guy looks super excited. Are we going now are we going?
Jesus the restraint, I’d go for the tickles
"women and children haaate me..."
He just wants more fellow seal friends! lol
I see one seal (sea lion) and a bunch of wannabes
Is this the seal who killed Bin Laden?
'So I heard you guys were hiring - let me show you my qualifications'
If it's cold enough that they need to have on a white suit over their head....why not long pants?
This reminds me of ELF. The sea lion is busy and the SEALs are the elves. The sea lion is told he is one of them and doesn't get why he doesn't quite fit in
Bud/s looks like it sucks so much.
Get wet and sandy.

Correction: the men are tagging along with the true seal.
That’s where they got the name from! I always wondered
I'm more of a Seal myself
It is a seal ion
I love how the guy in the back is walking in a way you *know* is just like "I'm coming bud! Wow you're so fast!" And being loving and supporting of baby sea lion. My heart.
And we act like Iran will be trouble when we have these troops on our battlefield
I bet they had to resist some strong urges to pet that thing
“Your torture training is my nap time, bitch”
What a cutie!
A seal in the SEALs  XD
Sea lions do eat seals.
It's actually a SEAL ION, the araut of the sea
That sea lion is fucking pumped, LETS GO BOYS!!!
It seems that the seal has found his role model
That was awesome.
This gets my SEAL of approval
All right rook; you take point.
Neal McBeal the Navy SEAL
Look at those tough guys pretending to not acknowledge that the cutest critter is next to them. I bet they girl talked about it in their bunks later though 😄
seals only pal no sea lions
Idiot
The seal is the chief
He's the one true seal.
Damn, if it was a seal it would of been perfect
I don't understand why the SEALS haven't adopted one as their mascot
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all day.
.
Awwwww it's their little brother
What do you mean? That’s Phil with 32,020 confirmed kills
Well, I like the sealion anyway.
Mascot located.
Swim? Swim? Are we going for a swim?
What shoes are the navy seals wearing? I want some super water shoes
That's how hard these men are. Not a single one dropped down to play with him. 
Stone cold.
This is so cute I wanna cry
Thank god it isn’t a Puppy following Marines.
Tough and cute is the best combination
stupid as it may sound, i actually am anxious for him to keep up. oy, as if i don't have anything else to worry about right now...
Seal: I will bweat you all at sea!

Well that just made my day! =)

This gets my seal of approval 😂
One of us, one of us!
These are my medals mother, from Army
Nice, I couldn't see a flag. What country does this SEAL team belong to?
The US. Military, besides the millions of innocent civilians they killed throughout the developing world are also responsible for more ecological destruction than most countries on Earth. 

They also play a key role in maintaining profits for the fossil fuel industry, which v is really harmful to seals and most other Sea life

Come on guys - I know the way!
I'm going to send my friend a beach ball.
What's in their bag?
OMG so cute ❤️
What's the big deal? It's just a seal with an extra electron.
He wants to help
He's been a Navy Sealion all his life!
That is cute
Are they SEALS with the trident already? Or Sailors at BUD/S? 

Still a cool video.
An origin story, how all Navy SEALs begin.... As baby seals
"That's right, folks. Let's do this!"
This post has my seal of approval.
Trying to tag along? Excuse you, thats sgt.flippers
Baby SEAL

Y’all better wait for him!!
How you gonna disrespect your mascot like that. Need to pet.
Baby water doggie
The little guy is thinking...hey I'm a seal too I'm comming swimming too safety in numbers. You keep me safe and I'll keep you safe.
Hold on you silly sea lion, you're no seal!
Cute 😍💕
\*in Big Shaq voice\* I don't think you have the facilities for that big man
I am disgusted by the lack of training of these seals.
Can you blame him?
“We gonna do a hecking good job of kiwing the terries!”
Now that is a good role model
He's a Navy Seal too
Hold up... they are actually swimming out there?? Are they swimming to a boat??
Good omen boys
What are the SEALS doing? Are they just like dramatically entering the water where their magical powers get activated or
The K9s of the sea.
Not sure you should call their drill Sergeant  a baby.
This is why I couldn’t be in the army. I’d stop and start playing with the seal even while the drill sergeant screamed at me.
that looks so cute!
ya'll some funny ass looking waterdoges, but hey ive
always got room for more pals!
This is the second cutest thing I've ever seen. The first was Fairy Penguins on Phillip Island.
See you know these guys are hard core and not messing about as any other people would have stopped and petted the seal with expressions glazed over in awwwwwwe.
Based on the last few years, im surprised that this is a video about the SEALS that isnt about them committing war crimes or murdering a fellow service member.
Whilst this might not be relevant it is very important. 

Every 40 seconds someone around the world dies by suicide. Person reading this - you are amazing!
