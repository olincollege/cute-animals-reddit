The incubator.
The cat be like fuck my life.
I got claustrophobia by watching this.
RIP cat if that dog farts mustard gas like most bully breeds.
Does anyone know what this giant pill-shaped cat enclosure is called? I want one.
Doggo: imma just make myself at home

Catto: what fresh hell is this?!
Cats: will totally invade your space with no hesitation as long as they are comfy. 

Also Cats: WTF are you doing? This is MY space! HOW DARE YOU! CHOMP!
Never thought I'd hear chinese yodelling
The side eye and glare from Kitty are spot on! 

I love how Pupper wants to be best friends, and Kitty is like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good. I‚Äôm my own best friend.‚Äù
The cat isn't amused
The cat was like you seeing this shit.
that yodel in chinese though...
that Frenchie  is a stage 5 clinger! Love the determination shown here.
That is one aggressively friendly dog
I feel sorry for the cat lmao
This post gave me claustrophobia
Cat: Bites dog butt

Dog butt: "You underestimate my power"
Doggo prolly likes kitty high body temp, kitty leaves when doggo toots.
The cat does need some personal space
Poor cat.
Poor cat can't have his own room, lol
My wife when I join her in bed
Poor cat
Lol this poor cat is obviously annoyed
This gives me anxiety.
Someone get that dog a teddy bear, the poor cat needs, like, five whole minutes to themselves.
I freak out when I'm trapped and imagining being in that cat's situation is giving me a panic attack.
Seriously dude. You are too big for this bed. Frack off!
This is hysterical and so cute!!
Cat: god damn it, dog. Fuck off.

[deleted]
That cat is hating life
Honestly this just makes me anxious idk why
You can almost pinpoint the moment the dog farted.
D:"move over"  C:"no one invited you" D:"move over" C:"I don't even like you" D:"almost got it" C:"OMG" D:"just gotta get this leg.... Right there" C:"You are an idiot" D:"hi friend" C:"hi friend"
That poor cat. I felt its distress and frustration in my soul. 

Doggo needs to learn about personal space.
Anyone else see this and think, ‚Äúthat dog is an asshole?‚Äù
Just breaking down those walls one snuggle at a time
Can we please talk about this Chinesische Jodeln in the background?

I have never heard yodeling in anything else than german, but this in chinese? It's golden and fits those two cuties sooo much!
The background music makes me want to stab my ears, holy shit
I‚Äôm too claustrophobic to even watch the whole video. Poor kitty!
That poor cat.
I mean, the cat looks like it's HATING this.
As cute as this is, you shouldn‚Äôt encourage this. Most cats needs their own safe space to get away otherwise they can get very stressed.
Everytime I am all set to delete Reddit and never install again I come across shit like this, fuck you but thank you
Damn, cat can‚Äôt be alone for one second üòæ
That dog has so much love to share
That dog totally farted in there.
I just picked up my deceased cats ashes at the vet and was crying my eyes out. This video made me laugh and laugh. THANK YOU!
This is the best video I‚Äôve ever seen.  Saving it for later to watch if I‚Äôm feeling sad.
That poor cat lol 
I lost it when the dog crawled in to the lion bed lol
Does anyone have the original source to this and not a rehost like the 9gags vid?
r/AnimalsBeingJerks
This is THE definition of a love/hate relationship lmao. Poor guy just can't comprehend why the cat doesn't love him.
Better cut that poor kitty an escape hole lol
As a frenchie owner and former cat owner‚Ä¶ this wins the internet.
I don't see this as adorable since the cat clearly is not enjoying it one bit.

Affection is nice but it needs to be a two way street, otherwise it's just annoying
This is one of the best videos I‚Äôve ever seen on this app
You should get another one, so your cat doesnt look like its suffering
Not gonna lie. Pups kind of a dick
Does anyone know what that glass bed in the first frame is called?
Yeah uh I don‚Äôt think the cat enjoys this at all
I hate this, it‚Äôs important that the cat has its own space to retreat and relax and feel comfortable in. It‚Äôs obvious that the cat doesn‚Äôt want the dog in there so perhaps you should put the video down and get your dog it‚Äôs own space?
When I feel like shit, these kind of videos help a lot. Bless you Op
The real question is about the music - when did Chinese (I think) yodeling become a thing?
This is just wrong.
I'm claustrophobic & this gave me major anxiety. I'd buy that dog a space heater & MUCH larger beds/openings all around just to save that poor kitty.
God dammit dog leave the poor cat alone
Doggo, you have to let the cat exit the elevator/subway car/space pod *before* you can get in
The cats face üòÇüòÇ
When that dog farts it‚Äôs going to be a capsule of doom.
u/savegif
Is the song Chinese Yodeling?
The cat say fuck me.
That cat is, like wtf dude
Love how cat the end the cat puts it paw up "Help me"
And then the dog farted.
Uhhh is this music in Chinese??? Not what I expected with how it started.
Dead
Lmfao this is so funny üòÇ
This just triggered my claustrophobia. Haha
Cat is like ‚ÄúBruh ‚Ä¶seriously?? WTF?‚Äù
üòÇüòÇüòÇ poor cat‚Äôs lookin like FML!
Damn, I‚Äôve gotta get me one of these cat capsules.
"i told you to get the bigger bubble janet"
I've never seen a more wtf face on a cat ever.
I love that the cat tried to preemptively leave the second time and got denied.
Why is this video making it difficult for me to breathe.
That's some /r/tightpussy.

EDIT: This has been posted there already.
Wait‚Ä¶.is this Chinese yodeling?!
And then the dog started farting
I need that bubble cat bed
‚ÄúGET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CARRRRR!!!‚Äù üòÜ Maybe get Puggle a few cat beds of his own, with warm water bottles in them.
Makes me uncomfortably claustrophobic just to watch this
Miaowstrophobic
... the dog was doing that on purpose, just to annoy the cat
Oh lawd he comin
The cat is in distress üòÇ
Is that chinese yoddeling? Lol this is a first for me
Frenemies summed up
r/Claustrophobia
Stupid dog
r/thisismylifenow
Is.. is that county music yodeling in.. uh.. Chinese?

Well, butter my butt and call me a biscuit! That's pretty darn good!
I absolutely LOVE this.  Cats already want to think they control all the environment, and the dog managed to evict kitty by being close and confining kitty.
Can we talk about the song though? Is it in Chinese? And they're yodeling..?
haha omg
Frikkin' hilarious!

Yo, at 1:17 I fucking lost it at the (*lil swipey swipes )‚Äùawwww hell naw biTCH!! back up ‚Äú
This made me terribly claustrophobic. Hard pass
Poor cat needs an up-high sanctuary.
my mother used to show me this several times a day and each time she would act like it was new
The poor cat omg üò≠üò≠
Just one fart to set the atmosphere
Owners of the pets are kinda trolls for not buying a bed to fit both of them. Poor cat is like FML.
And that's how my cat got claustrophobia
That poor cat. Dogs are so annoying. Love me less dog it‚Äôs for your own good.
Why are you like this? - the cat probably
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MUSIC AND WANT MORE OF IT NOW!!! Also, they‚Äôre cute.
Never been so annoyed for a cat before. Like dog you‚Äôre clearly being a nuisance fuck off
After watching this, I went into the bathroom and was honestly shocked to find my face covered in bruises.

Then I remembered that the music in this video had caused me to punch myself in the face over and over again.
The point of those little spaces is so the cat can have a small, safe cozy space to escape to and feel safe in. IT seems kind of bad that it can't. : <
This dog is an asshole, this cat is hating this, and the human filming is an enabler of bad behavior. The cat snapped and swatted at the dog; it stares at the human effectively begging to have something done. The tail twitch that the video highlights? That's annoyance. Please give your cat a space of its own. Cats are not dogs and they have different needs and ways of communicating those needs.
I Love the cats facial expression!
This is more grrr than aww. How about you stop encouraging this behavior from the dog. Get the cat a high perch or some other place to hangout.
Fuck these owners for letting their dog do this. That cat deserves it‚Äôs own space and is clearly uncomfortable. And people wonder why cats are so ‚Äúmean‚Äù all the time.
Is there enough air for both in that plasticky pill if their heads aren‚Äôt out?
That cat is pissed
ain't nuthin cute about this. this is just poor parenting of a delusional idiot.
This isn't cute... this is just someone encouraging that cat to fuck up that dog someday and then they're gonna be like "but they're fwends."
Why do these type of clips have the most annoying sound ever? My sound was thankfully off but I turned it on just to check and it was some dumb blabbering, gibberish loud AF‚Ä¶ like god damn. As cute as this video is it makes me want to downvote.
That poor cat, there is no way in which this is cute
Forced love!!
It‚Äôs funny that cat acts pissed but it could have easily escaped in many of those situations but was just like ‚Äúfuck it this be my life meow‚Äù
I could watch them all day
‚ÄúPlease. You see this, hooman. Why you no do something?‚Äù
Just when I thought I‚Äôve seen all the cutest things ever, you prove me wrong
I hate that dog.
This is one of the funniest things I've ever seen, absolutely dying laughing
Can you imagine the dogs farts in there?
Ugh. This made me claustrophobic just looking at it. Big a n x i e t y.
I am incredibly annoyed for that cat
This is hilarious. The cats expression reminds me of when I‚Äôm chilling on the couch and 1st comes one kid and then the next and finally the dog. Dammit all! üòÇ
please stop depicting brachycephalic dog breeds as "cute" -- not being able to breathe properly isn't cute.
This is so sweet
This is just too cute. Personal space? Idgaf‚Äîjust let me be close to you.
Love this!
Can you please stop torturing your cat for an internet video? It‚Äôs not cute.
this is not .r/aww this is r/wachpeople die inside
Cat can't breath üòÇ
I bet the dog fart a lot
I dont think i have laughed this much since a long long time. And the funny part is, i have sene this before!
RIP cat if this dog farts mustard gas like most bully breeds.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

As a German I approve of this music
I love everything about this ‚ô°
This video made my day ‚ù§
I love this.
I can has halp?
Cat be like: You shall not pas\~ WHEELP!
Cats behaving as if the dog just let one rip
So damn cute!!!!!!!!
Oh no stepbro im stuck
Id love it even more if the dog got in, blocked the door with his head and let out a huge fart and then the cat screams
Chinese yodeling? Didn't know that was a thing lol
Lol, perfect video to show what owning a cat vs owning a dog is like
"space? what do you mean you need a little space?"
I‚Äôm trapped in a glass box of emotion!!
Lol
Dog's been watching prank videos, getting ideas:  

https://youtu.be/R1DwrLTYeeI
You can actually see the pain.
Cat says f\*\*k close. All I need comfort
Its like those trains in japan, you cant get cos of the amount of ppl getting in
[deleted]
Where is his tail?
I love yodeling asians!
Oh, god. He's farting. HE'S FARTING!!!
Dog: we‚Äôre best friends!

Cat: why won‚Äôt this dim witted creature respect my personal space?
Adorable
Every dog-cat relationship is really about a highly tolerant cat and the needy, special needs dog.
r/thisismylifenow
She is sick and tiredt!
I love your catdog so vv much
Cat: you fat fuck. Really? I like you but damn.
The cat is definitely reacting to a toot at 1:40 lmao
Gonna need you to censor that butthole please /s
There is no "safe space", lol
My dogs and cats do this too! ü•∞üòç
This has to be the funniest video I have seen in a very long time
This is my life now.
I love how the cat just eventually gives up later
Does anyone know who makes the dog bed towards the end of the clip?? Seriously!! I need a bigger one for my girlfriend to live in during the winter.
much warm.
That's like the last flight I took minus 999% of the cuteness
Lol those are cool pets. Love cats shitty attitudes probably the best part about them. My cats are always big softies I want a grumpy cat üòæ
Poor kiddy
Yo can I get a link to that cat bed?
That dog is gonna fart bomb that cat while simultaneously body blocking the only exit. Savage
Why am I still here?
This is hilarious.
Does the cat have claws? This seems like pure torture for them
Such classic cat and dog stereotypes.

Dog: "Wants Hugs please!"

Cat: "Sir some personal space!"
"Frieeeennnnnnd..."
Thats a hostile takeover if ive ever seen one.
It's times like this that I realize what I really need is more Chinese yodeling in my life.
I think the dog farted. That cat was "for the love of god, let me outta here".
Poor thing will suffocate one day. Find a different sleep thing for kitty - a basket üß∫ maybe
Does anyone know where I can purchase this cat bed? My space kitty would LOVE it!!!
What cat bed is that at the beginning?
That dog is a cat in a dog's disguise.
the look on the cats face is priceless.
The cat is fucking done with his life
Watched it 3 times. So funny
Move over, Rover
That is the cutest fight ever
It was the best of times,
It was the worst of times.
The cat is just glaring at its human slave.
I like this video because it's the 1 out of 100 where the dog wins.
That was the cat's chill pill, and doggo took it!
I needed this. Thank you.
Until he farts in there
Great post work!
lol... the cat wants none of it but cant even escape.
Get a bigger closure ffs!
Cat: "O. M. G. dog cooties... get me tf outta here."
if he farts in that plastic bubble....
And you know that dog is a total fart knocker.
ROFL watching the cat squeeeeeeeze out.
This just cracked me up.
He ain‚Äôt heavy, he‚Äôs my brother.
Bruh, I need that for my cats.
That's my daughter and son and the bubble is our house
This is awesome!!!
How I download this cute video ??
How can people not resonate with cats?!
This gave my heart palpitations
That music kinda fire though

Loves to hate it.
Is that...a Chinese wild west some or something ?
This makes me anxious.
cats like i can‚Äôt i just can‚Äôt!!!
i am the cat
Can you raise the bed up?
That dog has a Jesus butt
This level of clinginess!!!
I laughed so hard I snorted hot dog out my nose.
The cat says what are you doing ok yeah what the hell
This was the laughs I needed today
It's not about comfort. It's about air-quality. lol
a lot of "smell my farts" vibe with that frenchy.
You know he be fartin' up in that tube.
I don‚Äôt know what this bed is but I need it
Dog‚Äôs gotta get his own space. Cat is frustrated. 
Some people are like this‚Ä¶unfortunately.
That cat never agreed to having a snuggle buddy
It's like SpongeBob and Squidward XD
Not again....
Your ass is too fat

*Noooooo it's not
Yes.
It
Is.
I'm stuck.
IM STUCK damnit.

*Farts...
There are cats who know dogs can't follow them to the top of the fridge and there are cats that have never been to the top of a fridge.
Knowing pugs, that has become a gas chamber
Legitimately one of the sweetest things I‚Äôve ever seen.
until the dog farts............

Video is adorable.  Music is torturous.

Where can I get that capsule pet... thing?
I guess this is cute but the cat seems to be declawed and claustrophobic.
Why am I this cat???
Cat: ‚ÄúI hate your stupid fucking dog.‚Äù
Let meowt!

Absolutely hilarious
‚ÄúMistah Mistah! GET ME OUTTA HERE ! ‚Äú
Someone doesn‚Äôt want to be close.
The Cat hates it lmao
Dammit, Moon Moon!

Bet that dog is farting in there too.
My lab was doing this to me during my nap.  Gave me a panic attack :(
Butch keeps messing with Tom...somewhere in a wall nearby, Jerry is laughing his ass off.
Tsundere cat
One of the funniest, cutest things I‚Äôve seen in a long time. That poor kitty üòÜ
If he farts that cat is ded
He farted! AIR AIR I NEED AIR
TIL Chinese yodeling exists
I can‚Äôt breathe!
What a weird cat, still acting calm, usually they wouldn't hesitate to go into supersonic massacre mode. The dog must have some dirt on the cat, scary.
Where is the dog's tail?
I don't find this aww. It gives me major anxiety.
God help that cat when the Frenchy farts!
One fart would end that cat.
This reminds me of that episode of tom and jerry where tom gets whacked on his head with a broom by his owner and thinks that he is a mouse too and proceeds to stuff himself inside Jerry's small house and lives with him.
"HALLPP"
This is even funnier if you imagine the dog constantly ripping farts.
should've seen this same video but someone added a farting noise to the dog. I was laughing my ass off.
Very cute! Love cuddle bugs!

##Please tell me about that music!

That is the yodeling western Asian(?) crossover I have been looking for my whole month! If I knew enough about language identification, I would attempt to credit an actual culture, but I didn't want to be rude and misattribute one language as another. I genuinely like this music, and I want to hear more!
Cat looks like they want to piss on the dogs head
Two pets enter.  One pet leaves.
This actually made me feel claustrophobic.

Edit: Amazon. Duh.
NO! NO! NO!!! You keep farting and stinking up my bed! Get OUT!

What are these called
"Let me get out before you get in. Stop! Stop LET ME GET OUT!!"
‚ÄúThe cat was too stunned to speak‚Äù
If he fits, he sits.
Cat: my bed
Dog: our bed
I'm calling it now, Chinese yodeling is going to be the sea shanties of 2022
"Why."
Help. Me.
One toot in there and it's all over
Sweethearts ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I imagine he got doggy dutch ovened
Anyone got a link for the cat bed?
Twice bitten, still comfy.
Cat: "This thing is full of dog farts"
Fuuuuck that music.
Poor cat üòÜ
I love how long it just keeps going and getting better and better.  At least three times I though ‚Äúoh that was great ‚Ä¶ wait it‚Äôs not over!‚Äù
That cat is getting tired of the dogs shit ü§£
This is incredible.
If that dog farts that cats toasted
You are a shit parent for not stopping the dog from going in the cats room.
As a man I feel silly for thinking this is absolutely adorable. On the other hand, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE
The original with the dog farting in the tiny space is way better
That dog definitely farted and that‚Äôs why the cat is trying so desperately to get out.
Yeah, I feel sorry for the cat and this dog just has no clue about any sort of personal space. 

But did you see doggo put his back legs in mid air and wiggle them in? Adorable.
Too cute! Love the song!
Everything about this post made me think of [another Reddit post.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/s2upe3/woman_forced_to_stay_at_blind_dates_apartment_for/)
Kitty is so sick of his shit
Introverts when they are dating extroverts
Anyone else see a man in a paragliding suit in the dogs butt?
The dog didn't seem to mind but the cat towards the middle and end of the video was really started hating every minute of it like fuck my life why.
"...what?!"
That‚Äôs just ridiculous cuteüê∂üò∏üòÑ
Cat is pissed off, I bet the dog farys in there.
Dobbiamo star‚Äô vicini vicini!

Why is the the tune to this a yodeling CCP?????

That cat for sure dreams about murdering the dog in his sleep haha
The pain in that cars eyes said everything
This made me realy happy
This is insanely adorable
Bet the cat wants a cat tree for its birthday.

Imagine if one farts
Finally a doggo getting even for the millions of stolen beds, LMAO
jesus this poor cat just wants some alone time
oh man the cat cracks me up in this
I bet that cat wishes it could trade in some of those 9 lives
Dog DEFINITELY farted in there

Don't believe that cat. He LOVES that dog.
I laughed waaaay toooo hard at this üòÜ
I'm genuinely curious. Did the cat come first or did the dog come first? I'm going to guess the cat came first.
That stare at the Camera man from inside like "Bruh, can you help?"
‚Ä¶. Is that music‚Ä¶. Are they yodeling in mandarin or Japanese or something?
Does anybody know what type of cat this exactly is? Looks so cute with the moon-like face.
Dog was like ‚ÄúYou friend, I go with you!‚Äù
Nice and cozy!
The longer I watched the better it got
Awww so cute
And when there‚Äôs room to escape? THE CAT DECIDES TO STAYü•∞
You know that dog farts it up in there and that‚Äôs why cat is mad
Classic Bulldog! ü§£

That was a fart at the end there.  You can tell by the cat‚Äôs reaction.
This made my night
That was hilarious!
LMFAO
This belongs on r/Thisismylifemeow
Where can I find that bed!?!?! My cat would freaking die if he got one of those he‚Äôd be so happy!
Cat never consented
That is claustrophobic!
They are funny and precious!
The cat is making faces but they are BUDDIES! 

‚ÄúUgh it‚Äôs not like I like this or anything‚Äù
"What are you doing, step-dog?"
Just got better and better
First time in my life I've heard a chinese country music.
Poor kitty, she doesn't seem very happy with this arrangement
This is so cute it‚Äôs disgusting. ü§£ü§£

Well the dog is comfortable
That made me uncomfortable to watch. More so than 99% of the bad things I have ever seen on Reddit.
Omg I laughed out loud so hard outside my apt the next door hag came out without a excuse to see whose joy she could snuff out ‚Ä¶not this time Karen not this time
Poor Cat
I got claustrophobic just watching this
Get out of the cat-pill!
Get the cat it's own space. it clearly doesnt enjoy being fucking layed on top of. this isnt awww at all
don't worry, cats are liquid
Got it!

Didn‚Äôt someone post something like this where the dog would not stop farting?
This was great
I feel sooooo clostrophobic watching this!
Yes, yes
Chinese yodeling! My dreams have come true!!!! 2022 is going to be my year!!!!! I love you all!
That‚Äôs adorable
I just found out my sister has covid, I needed this, thanks.
Omg ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
It's because short faced dogs take in a lot of air in their stomachs when they breathe and eat. And the anus is the only place the air can come out. That's why they fart every 5-10 minutes. And it smells awful lol
Who would buy this shit its basically just a fart bubble
Nice
So much dog butt
Someone needs to give this cat a bed on a high shelf.
This video is making me claustrophobic
Without that song this wouldn't be as funny
the cat be like get the fuck out my house you bitch
That poor cat.
You know that cat is thinking "FFS Roscoe,  have you never heard of personal space?" Cracked me up,  husband thought I was loosing my mind I was laughing so hard.  Absolutely made my day
There is nothing "aww" about this. That dog is either dumb as bricks or just an asshole, and the cat is highly uncomfortable, something the owners either don't notice or don't care about.
WHY WON'T YOU LOVE ME?!?
I don‚Äôt care what the owner says or thinks. That cat is plotting the dogs demise. Every day.
This dog is low key annoying and toxic
This made me laugh!
this is like a spongebob squidward relationship
Where did you get this piece of furniture
Codependency at its finest, this is not a healthy relationship fur real.
Laughed so hard I cried
Thanks for this. It was the best thing I saw today‚ù§Ô∏è

LOL this is so Frenchie. They're such little lover bears

I wondered how quickly the cat would leave‚Ä¶?
ü§£
Cat: ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt ask for this type of warmth‚Ä¶.Dutch oven a** muthaf*****!!!‚Äù
She is seriously  not happy üò°üò°üò°
This is the funniest shit lmao
That was a WHOLE STORY!

It had me laughing, and ahh-ing, even a surprised gasp!

that cat, tho', for sure the star of the show!
The yodeling Chinese song almost made me forget about the current genocide they're taking part in. Almost.
Love this
Cats like, you @sshole
That one friend!!!
Someone found a bigger one for them!
Say what you want, but that music fucking SLAPS!
So this is what a cat's personal hell looks like.
Where did you get that cat house I love it!
Really appreciate cat patience
I get claustrophobic just watching this.
True little sibling energy
This is just the best.
Cute but wtf is up with the music
Thats how my ex wife used to react to me crawling into bed with her...
This is simply the greatest thing I have ever seen. Sans music.
The cat is so lovely and beautiful and Bull wants her secured always by his side which is possibly still possible as they all live together and the most funniest part is that they can't do without each other ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Those booty dimples lol
Cat - *Why are we here? Just to suffer*
Every fucking time -Cat
Dude I need that cat house! Where can I buy it?
Great scene.
That 3rd clip, when his little face reacts to what can only be a fart, honestly had me laughing like fuck. 

God this was too funny
It looked like the cat was saying HELP
Wtf was that music? Chinese yodeling?
How sweet and cuddly
The dog farted
The expressions on the cats face are priceless
cat"get away, you stalker"
