Incoming Reddit Karma from being on the front page: priceless.

[Marshall wants to know if your dog wants to start a crew](https://i.imgur.com/q2VUAiC.jpg)
I agree matey.
Prefers to sniff the booty
So damn cute 
"I take the booty. I lick the booty. Booty is life."
Omg, this pic alone , put a huge smile on my face and that's worth the $9 bucks you paid.
This needs a photoshopbattles
r/aww ? More like arrrrww
"ARRRE YA RRRREADY KIDSSSS????"
$9 for 5700 karma, so that means like 6 and 1/3 karma per $0.01 USD

Impressive.

What will we do with a drunkin puppers?

What will we do with a drunkin puppers?  Early in the mornin!
I think I love him. Dog.
If dogs could talk they'd be draggin our asses to court daily haha 
$9 for 75k orang internet points

Seems legit
As a pirate, I don't appreciate your dog appropriating my culture. Are you saying we are dogs? Do you think we all have hooks for hands? I find this very offensive. 
Okay that is straight up adorable and hands down the best thing I've seen today. If that isn't 9 dollars well spent I don't know what is. 
https://youtu.be/pMhfbLRoGEw
But I don't want to be a pirate!
Arrrrrrrrrrrf
So a pirate walks in a bar with a steering wheel in his pants, bartender says " hey, you got a steering wheel in your pants " pirate " Arrrgghh and its driving me nuts "
this is the highest score ive ever seen on Reddit.

And the first dog pic ive ever shown my buddy
I can't stop laughing 
He needs a steering wheel coming out of his belt buckle, so when someone asks, he can say:

"Arrrr.......it's drivin' me nuts"
Omg hes so cuuute.my heart is screaming PARLAY!!
My dog has three legs I NEED THIS COSTUME!!!!!
Omg that's adorable 
haha frend what a cute puppy! or maybe not puppy now,  i dont know haha. i hope he get lots of love :)
Unbelievably adorable. 
This pic is priceless haha
That is fucking great.
Your $9 costume is better than any crappy TV morning show Halloween dog parade costume I've seen this week.
I like the pet costume posts better than the human ones. He's adorable!!
Captain dog beard 
Kinda reminds me of Nibbler...
I knew I should've bought this during the one day Amazon costume sale !
/r/arr
Arrrrr(f), 'tis a beast more hideous than ever seen before, arrrrrr(f).
I can sea why, theres just no arrrguing with those results
[deleted]
That is awesome. Do frenchys just go with the flow or do they hate stuff like this?
The fact that your dog appears quite content in it *is* as well
**pro tip**: make a fuck ton of pics, this way the cost will divide so if you lose 1 pic you don't lose all the 9 bucks
dog abuse! :p 
I want one... but bigger... for my American Bulldog :'( PLZ
I feel like it wants to give me a quest
"I loathe you with every fiber of my being."-Your dog
OP where did you get it.
Where did you get this!? My friend's Boston terrier only has one eye, I think you can see where I'm going with this. 
[You are a Pirate.](https://youtu.be/pMhfbLRoGEw)
OMG. I work with the woman who sells these!!! https://petkrewe.com/collections/dogs/products/pirate-costume-for-dogs... also on Amazon, search "pet krewe"
Let the PS battle commence.
For $9 this picture is with more than that. 
Worth every penny!
Your eat the craby pattie the way I make it or you don‚Äôt eat at all 
Oh lord, so cute, this little doggy.
Indeed it is 
I'm in charrrrrrrrge now!
This pic is worth twice as much as that. Epic. 
Yer a good salty dog!
Photo shows  you chose well.
The most awesome thread I have come across! ‚ò†Ô∏è arrgh! 
/u/thejokerbaby 
Haha! The dog looks like a pirate in that costume. But it's a dog! 
Frenchie or Boston?
And the 100k+ karma you just got.
I need this for my Boston..   he's only got 3 legs  
Thanks OP. I just bought this costume from Amazon. 
I hope it was worth your pupper's self esteem...
Petco charges 25 for a costume half as good...
I can read his eyes: he is saying 'Pllease let me out of this thing!!!'
Such a cutie!! You got you did NOT waste your money!!
Aw, he's adorable. But please don't dress your animals up unless they enjoy it. It's uncomfortable for them and unecessary.
Lol so cute 
[deleted]
Yes, yes it is
Patches The Pirate
Arr-dorable!
my goodness, that's cute
It is. Such a cutie. 
9$. 81k karma. well invested sir. 
And apparently its also a 100.000 karma worth 
Barrrrrrrggg
This is muttiny!
This needs to be my profile pic
"why you do this 2 me hooman?'
Avast ye mateys..got a bone to pick with you! 
Including tax?
It keeps getting better
Ahoyy Frenchie!!
Welcome to Candle Cove
True.  Funny to see a pirate dressed up as a dog. Mask and feet worth the $9.
*Yooouuurreee aaaa CROOK Captain HOOK judge won't you threw the BOOK!*
I swear I've seen this exact image before.

Or maybe everybody likes pirates.
Take that one trick or treating.
This would have got more points if your dog was an amputee, I guarantee it. 
Why did you pay for it? You could have "pirated" it
A picture is worth a thousand words. And a thousand words it atleast enough for a novel to be published at CHAPTERS for $20 a book
[Fat Gladys](https://imgur.com/a/42E8k) approves.

Lol
"I'm in charge now!"
It's AdmiralBulldog!
Ooooo!!! :3 Pirates have it ruff.
Really? I think I'd only pay about tree-fiddy . . .
Lol...not a fan of the overload of pet pics but this is cute.
This makes me sad.
Made that $9 back in karma.
I matey
Arrrrrgggghhhh !!!!
At the time of this posting, OP's submission has 21.2k upvotes.

If costume was $9, TIL, a Reddit upvote is worth 0.042¬¢

Good investment, OP!
I had the exact same sentiment when I bought one for my Cat.
r/Aww? More like r/arr!
That look of betrayal.. aww...
His face is precious aww
You'd better use steemit dot com or dmania dot lol for publishing such  content therefore ;)
I like turtles

Awesome Halloween costume...Did you bought it online? Because it's surprisingly well fitted.
Please tell me you have a parrot costume for yourself
First time I read this I saw $91 and got genuinely concerned 
I thought it said you paid $91 at first!
So worth it!!!
Give me a treat ‚Äòr walk the plank.
This is when you know that having your own personal tailor is worth it
This is so adorable awww!
This is animal crawlty
I approve 
ah, it's good that people support the developers.

personally, i pirated that costume.
That's so cute, I want to squeeze his fat little wrinkled cheeks.
That's so cute, I want to squeeze his fat little wrinkled cheeks.
Only $9?! That‚Äôs a steal. All the costumes I saw that would fit my chihuahua were like $20-$30
It's captain pugwash!!
He is so cute!!! I need this for my cats.
Great shot, you got such the perfect angle. Having such a wonderful subject to photograph must of been a pleasure. Happy Halloween!
I have the same outfit for my dog! 
Dog is scared of no one!
Hunch Hunch! What What!

Do they make these for big dogs?
Where did you get the idea to dress your dog as a pirate?
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre ya sure about that matey?! *Closes one eye*. I'll leave.
Worth buying the dog just for this pic alone. 
The most powerful ruffboy of the seven seas!
Please tell me, is the dog real? Or is the costume separate and for the existing living doggy? 
The question is , were Pugs Pirates?
I say yes.
Fav of the day!
Looking like a pirate of the caribian seaüôÑüôÑ
Side-view pic, please.
Peter, you (Karma) whore! 
Worth even more!!!!! As a Vet Tech Ive seen many a feline and K9 in Halloween dress...the practice I currently work at does a yearly contest with 3 prizes...nice basket with a gift card towards your bill...this is one of the best i have ever seen!  Def would have won 1st prize! Thanks for sharing!
We want him in the next pirates movie.
WHITE WHALE HOLY GRAIL
The carpet he's standing on is immaculate 
It is also worth quite a bit of Reddit karma evidently. 
Agree! This is priceless!
Your doggie is cute.I ordered this costume 4 weeks ago for my cat, still have not received. 
Love it!!
The true definition of value.
It's worth at least 10x what you paid for it
This is why I like the internet, God damnit
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrf.
so cute. can i have one. 
Where can I find one of these?
Is it me or is he standing
Very nice dog
This is more than worth the $9 you paid 
Agreed! So cute!
I'd buy that for a dollar 
Yes, yes it is.
if i see any more cute pet costumes i might explode
What a legend!
Thats one scurvey dog!
You just made my day...
How many times did he bite you when you put it on?
A true statement
this is the best thing i will ever see
Enjoy that nice clean carpet, cause it is gonna be pee and poo COVERED after forcing him into that get up.
Omg , it is worth the money.  I should have purchased pet costume this.. this.. is adorable. 
I need this in my life
What's the pir
Awesome!
this should be a one piece character 
Now I know how it feels when a dog has a better costume than you.
XD
this picture was made for that sweet karma
Best costume ever
Everyone: "Oh he so cuuuuute!"
Dog: "I hate you all."
I'll take ten please.
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWR HOW CUTE
Yes. Yes it is
He needs a parrot. 
Do these looks as good on big dogs or just smaller dogs?
For cat freaks like me this store has it for cats Katloveskat.com my cat looks hilarious too!
arrrf me maties
He looks a lot like Petey from The Little Rascals. Minus the circle around his eye. 
Without doubt, the best thing I've seen on Reddit so far, the photo AND the comments (member 18 months).


Worth the sweet karma too
And it is worth 70k+ imaginary internet points as well it seems.
aww look at the salty little sea dog!! 
adorable
Ah jaysis this is fucking cute!
You poor puppy, I feel your pain. May be you could dress your owner up like a chihuahua.
This is everything! 
Me: (Shows husband this pic) 

Husband: (Shakes head) 

Me: What? I thought you'd like it! 

Husband: I do...I'm shaking my head in disbelief at how awesome it is.
Yo I have that same entertainment stand it sucks
Bruh u got Twister!
Does that pirate have two hooks? Poor guy.
Arrrgh and a fine, stompin Pirate he is! 
Did you factor in the price of your phone(and what percentage of that cost can be designated as, "for this picture"), along with the electricity  cost of charging your phone enough for this picture(along with uploading it)?
This is why the ancient paintings will be never known and photos like this will be the new history
Super cute
Haha Funny
OOHHHHH 
  WHO LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE UNDER THE SEA? 
  SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS
Aaaaaarrrr (f)

How did you fit into that thing?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJCI1m57HDE
I‚Äôm laughing thank you :)
I feel like i missed something... how did all the poetry start??
I've paid way more for way less. Well done!
Too funny
Do they happen to make this in Coonhound size? Our Harlan would be a great pirate! 
I often wonder what animals think of us. 
Whoa!  Need my eyes checked!  Read that as $91.
I would cuddle that dog so hard!
"Why is the rum gone?"

This pic made my day :)
Captain Pugwash.
yes it is lol sooo cute!
Can I be his first mate?
if dogs were pirates, i'd imagine them to have that kind of face!
Where did you buy the costume ? 
Bork Sparrow
This is the most adorable thing I‚Äôve seen all day! 
Human... why?
OMG this is the cutest Pup I've ever seen!!!
LOL! Luv it. You got your moneys worth 10 fold.

Sir, 

You win Halloween!! 

-Good day
My phone has some dead pixels on the screen so from my perspective it looks like he has an eyepatch on his right eye lol
That's so funny
This is too cute for words and definitely worth every penny of the $9 cost for the costume!!  I‚Äôd love to get one for my pupper!!
Ahoy, good boy 
OOOOOOOOOhhhhhhhhh.....who lives in a pineapple under the seaaaaa?
In the name of all that‚Äôs holy, why doesn‚Äôt anybody here ask about a shopping link?? [gasp] Is this a repost????
I'd pay $80 for this.
You spent $9 on Karma
9 bucks for 100k karma. That‚Äôs a pretty good deal. 
I know this will get downvotes but whatever.

Stop dressing your animals up. They are not dolls, but animals!
I hope you didn't make him/her feel embarassed or ashamed by laughing. Poor thing
he doesnt look happy at all though :/
"Im going to murder you"
 karma points up lol 
Love
haha stupid dog, he no pirate xd 
This is exactly why animals attack unexpectedly. 
Cfdry66887
dont do this to your animals
I disagree. 
Still trying to sell this crap, huh?
A picture is worth $9 apparently
funny puppy 
At the current post rating of 60,808 points, you basically bought karma at a rate of 6,700 points for every dollar.  Quality bulk purchase.
Sooooo cute ‚ù§Ô∏è
And now we know that internet points are worth, at most, $9 per 73.6K...
bARRRRRRRRRk !
That's so freaking cute!!! 
This is so amazing wow lol
"Arrrrrrrff"
Those armsüòÇ
That‚Äôs a good one!üê∂
Cute...
Mom got this for the cat last year. You know how animal's faces can be expressive, but you're not sure if they match up with a certain emotion like we know them? Well this cat *HATES* wearing this costume. **HATES** it. Like, I'm sure he's plotting genocide right now.
I weally weally wuff you

I weally weally do.
When I say I wuff you
It's weally, weally true

I'm filled with admirwation

for all the things you do.

2 hooks makes pirating hardddddd.‚ò†Ô∏è

Fuck pugs 
I am loving this ü§óü§óü§óü§óü§óü§óü§óü§ó
So far 2k upvotes/dollar.
Every penny 
$9 is nothing 
I dunno, I have that photo now and I didn't pay anything.
That‚Äôs a really cheap personal camera man. 
$9 = 37k karma?
‚Äúget off me arse,
