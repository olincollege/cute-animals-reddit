My doctor has to do the same for me!
Can human doctor visits be like this too? I would be much more cooperative if someone gave me some, what I assume is peanut butter (?) and then hugged me.
At our clinic sometimes we would write the dog's name in cheeze wiz on the wall, and while they were licking it off we could give vaccines, or trim nails etc.
Bulldogs lack any awareness of anything happening around them if motivated by food near them. A pack of wolves could be charging towards one and if there‚Äôs peanut butter, it won‚Äôt give a shit.

#WHAT A LITTLE MEATBALL
That's experience right there....
I feel like if someone stabbed me while I was eating a giant pizza I would be really pissed.
Why is the genuine happiness of animals so infectious?! Such an adorable little potato.
Brave of him to pickup up a bulldog right after it ate. That's the splash zone. Typically stay clear of mine until he shakes off. Normally get some kibble launched across the room.
Now if only my doctor could treat me this way, next time I need a jab...
That would have been good to know when 3 vets couldn‚Äôt hold down my cat
Okay but real talk that human is just as wiggly as the dog.
I don‚Äôt even think the bulldog felt it through their rolls
Was anyone else reminded of Ted from Schitts Creek?  This guy looks like him and this is something Ted would definitely do!
That's a cute potato!
That wiggle butt!
My sister‚Äôs dog did something interesting. 

She accepted the peanut butter, but when she put it on the ground, she distrusted the treat and sat away from the vet. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen that before,‚Äù the vet said. The dog ate the peanut butter after the vet left.
This is the "Fear Free Vet" practice!!! Love them.
A spoon of peanut better would cost around $200 in human hospital :)
[removed]
So sweet!!! The cuddle at the end.
Bulldog puppies are so fucking cute.
That vet is hot
Bulldog wiggle butts are something that will never *not* be adorabull
This is a fear free technique from an awesome tech. Know if you can‚Äôt come in due to covid we still love your animals!
Edit: Or doctor
I'm a vet and do this on every vaccination, most of my colleagues do it too. It makes your life much easy and on the next vaccination they will remember and are soooo happy to see you again.
I liked that vet. He's cute.
Dog Gone It!
I need a dog.
My wife is a vet, she says the animals on the whole are way better without their owners In the room they think it is due to the animals not feeling like they need to protect their owners anymore while away.

They do make an exception for the final visit obviously for owners in the room.
Last time I saw a needle and a spoon so close... ahh nm.
Where is the sound! I feel cheated out of adorable snuffles!
My dog recently had to visit the vet too. He was very happy going there. 

He got an injection, and puked all the things he was not supposed to eat, and was ill after that from the injection. He did not feel good after 2 hours and the vet suggested to come around to his office. 

Near the office the dog was all happy and feeling good again, so that saved extra treatment. He just wanted the treats at the vets office.
Genius
Dog's like "Y'all got any more of that peanut butter?"
I love that dog when the vet picks him up...fuck you, I want that food - put me down.
I wish this worked on cats too.
Get this man a medal!
That cuddle. Omg üòç
Sure you do this with a dog and it‚Äôs cute as hell; but when you try this on your human patients suddenly you have a ‚Äúlicence hearing‚Äù with your local medical board.
My cats go to a local animal hospital. It's on the high side price-wise, though not too much more than other options in the area,, but they pump in Feliway like a Cinnabon in the mall, and they give them all the tuna and concentrated catnip they could possibly want. My older cat, who's sweet but flighty around strangers, turns into an absolute lovebug. It's worth the extra bucks to make vet visits happier for them.
This is what a good veterinarian looks like. I've been so fortunate to aork with people like this taking care of my animals in the past (dont have animals atm) and its always easier when yoir animal sees the vet as a fun (or at least pleasant) experience because you don't feel like you have to drag them in. Good vets aren't just less stressful for the animal,  they're less stress for the parents too.
These are called ‚ÄúFear  Free techniques‚Äù.
Hospital employees can be individually certified  as well as the practice  as a whole! 
For all animal lovers and humans in the vet field it is worth looking into! Such a different experience  for animals and less stress for the staff and patients.  
Imo: the pandemic and the amount of pet adoptions without proper socialization has equaled an overwhelming amount of pets with increasing fear, anxiety and stress! We need to do better for these animals that only want to do good for us! 
Thanks for listening ‚ù§Ô∏è
The vet lures my cat on the scale with easy cheese. He‚Äôs a doll at the vet but hates the scale for some reason
Awww, they're both good boys.
Wait a minute, is THAT why my doctors always give me a spoonful of peanut butter?  What the hell, man?!
We do something similar by smearing pill pockets on the exam table. I don‚Äôt think it is the best idea to let the dog chew on a metal spoon.
I have an Old English Bulldog and they absolutely have zero reaction to feeling the needle it's crazy.
All those rolls... he didn‚Äôt feel a thing
Please do this to me for Covid vaccine I hate needles and I like peanut butter
That how I get laid lol lol.
Unfortunately our dogs got into a fight with each other and both needed stitches and staples. We were on a long distance road trip with them when it was time to take the stitches and staples out so we found a local vet and they agreed to do the job. I was mildly nervous about the process but the vet, who happened to be a large animal vet (horses and such) just walked up to the dogs and yoinked all the hardware out. It took about 2 minutes per dog and they behaved like nothing was happening the whole time.

He said he had a client that was some large dog that was so well behaved that its owner would tell the dog to lift a paw for trimming and the dog would stand there with one paw at a time lifted so the vet could trim its nails.
It is sometimes that easy, although I would not give the dog a metal spoon lol. And hopefully not vaccinating in the scruff
u/savevideo edit: bot cant reply in the thread, heres the link https://redditsave.com/info?url=/r/aww/comments/lg6o7u/he_makes_vet_visit_look_easy/
Genuine question: what happens if the owner is allergic to peanuts? I‚Äôm just assuming it‚Äôs peanut butter.
I wish there was sound... *snort snort*
We have to do this with our diabetic dog twice a day. It‚Äôs always a race to get the insulin in while he‚Äôs still distracted by his kibbles and chickies
Wow... what a vet !!! The Best !
Things like this make me want to be a vet. Having to put down and see very sick animals keep me from being a vet
secret trick that makes Vet visits easy, bulldogs love him.
Is it still a bamboozle if the pupper doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs been bamboozled?
No fucks given when peanut butter is involved
I see no ring on this man. Reddit, help a girl find her soulmate. Connect me with this man!
The veterinarian's handling of the dog is excellent
That guy reminds me of Ted from Schitt's Creek. The hot, kind vet.
Dog :)
Oof, they better change their plan from a spoon to a pretzel stick or they‚Äôre going to be referring patients to my ER to have spoons endoscopically removed!
Doc,,,you're for sure in the right business,,bless you and your sweetness,,that fat morsel appreciates you,  awwww pups!
What a vet ! He did an awesome job. I‚Äôve had dogs all my life and had good veterinarians but this guy is the GOAT of vets.
The $1.50/day in peanut butter expenses probably let them do twice as many examinations. :)
Look at those PAWSSS! He‚Äôs gonna be a big potato sack soon!!
That's the sweetest euthanizing I've ever seen.
Gave rottweiler puppy peanut butter during a bath once. Now he will randomly stand in the tub because he wants more peanut butter.

Anyone thinking of becoming a vet tech just know the job isn‚Äôt just playing with fun, nice puppies n kittens all day lol

chonky boi
I read the title all bleary-eyed in the morning and thought it said, "He makes vet visit look sexy".

 Was not disappoint.
This doc seems to have trained with the Pediatrician we‚Äôve all seen videos of who plays games and jokes around with his little patients while trying to give immunizations. All doctors... for people (of all ages), animals and the like should be like this!

Also, the puppy hug at the end - that‚Äôs his reward for being such a kind human.
Can I go next?
When you truly love your job‚ô°
He blep for camera at the end. My eyes have been blessed by holy water
r/nextfuckinglevel worthy ?
I swear dogs don‚Äôt feel anything while they‚Äôre eating something they enjoy. My golden is so fidgety when he gets raked and nail trim. But as soon as I put a milk bone in his face for him to chomp on, he sits stoic as a statute and endures(ignores) whatever grooming is happening.
I hope when I get the COVID vaccine it‚Äôs like this..
This man is a genius.
What a cute snuggle bug. üòä
So sweet! Also everything about this man is sexy.
But the real question is. can he do that with cats
lol must get the food
My mom's old yorkie was diabetic and associated needles with food. And wanted attention from everyone and everything. The vet was heaven for her.
Why do they all have nice looking biceps?
yo thet was smooth
Lol. Now do it with my cat.
is this the vet from Schitt‚Äôs Creek?

I‚Äôm wondering, is dog hating vets a myth ? 

My dog and friends dogs all don‚Äôt care/loves vet and apart from German shepherds and cats I haven‚Äôt really seen any dog terrified of the vet
Obviously a very young pupper. Otherwise he wouldn't have needed help to get the last of that peanut butter.
A doctor did this to me before by annual prostate exam...

I hope that was my doctor...does anyone else have a doctor who dresses up like the UPS guy?
Use a wooden spoon next time. 
I would not be happy with a cracked tooth. 
I never use metal spoons with dogs.
Cute video, just alittle side note.
My family's old dog Molly used to love the Vet and when my sister got a cat Purcy we would schedule them together; Molly's happiness helped Purcy know that the Vet is a place with nice people and, even with her being gone for over a year now, he still behaves himself whenever he goes.
Stealth.
Thank you so much for this. I truly mean it, OP, from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.
Cute cute
I really hope his owner doesn‚Äôt have a peanut allergy. Speaking from experience
Great vet no doubt, but I really think it would not work on my cat. He turns into a beast when we go to the vet.
Dudes a SNACK lmao
Is that Ted from Schitt‚Äôs Creek?
TIL you can just stop animals injections anywhere. Don‚Äôt need to find vein or anything
Imagine how much peanut butter he goes through.
at least the sweetheart won't be scared anymore! She/He'll love going to the vet in no time!

I need to see more of these.
Being a vet was one of my dream jobs. But with the amount of both money and time to become one, I lost interest. Not to mention I couldn't handle the negative aspects of it all. So, I took a different route and volunteer when I have the time to. Still get to help, just in a different way.

In human terms, the lesson I learned is to watch my back when I am offered gifts during stressful times because there might be a knife/needle coming to stab me in the back.
This guy clearly *loves* his job.
That‚Äôs awesome.

Our Labradoodle was always happy to go to the vet; she was happy to go anywhere and was so charming and lovable she truly believed everybody loved her, because they basically did.

She never complained about injections, she was just a really sweet girl.

Our Goldendoodle guy is a ‚Äúnervous Nellie‚Äù - vet‚Äôs notes actual words...we can‚Äôt go in with him due to Covid, and I‚Äôm really proud that he does go in with them, even if he is nervous...that‚Äôs just the type of dog he is. He is still very sweet, and when he gets to know people, he‚Äôs very loving and affectionate (he comes up behind your and pushes his head and chest between your knees so you can give him chest rubs.

We had to rush him to the vet over the weekend because a cut or scratch on his face had become infected...hard to tell because of his coat, but we realised it had gotten pretty bad. 

He‚Äôs a trooper, though, despite his nerves.
I was totally looking at that peanut butter spoon, what did I miss?
Let‚Äôs see him trim my cat‚Äôs claws
Dentist really did a helluva job here
My Bulldog would have swallowed that spoon. No exaggeration sadly
Wow
I want this veterinarian to take care of my pets

I always got my vaccinations as a child from a savy veteran ER nurse who would sock you in the arm an instant before and you would hardly notice anything at all.  Distraction is a powerful ally.
Aahhwhw
I want one

Any unnecessary risk to doggos teeth from the spoon?
One of the best parts about being a Vet is you get to cuddle your patients without getting arrested.
Gunna start seeing a vet instead of my doctor. Mofo gives me peanut butter and hugs!
So cute
Hahah yep how you do it !
He is sooo cute
I once gave our old bull dog around 6-7 spoon fulls of peanut butter for his birthday while mom was gone. That night he woke me up with the poops. I‚Äôve never seen that boy run so fast down a set of stairs before. R.I.P Stouffer.

"OH boy, peanutbutter!"

My dog hates having his nails trimmed and passed out the last time he had them done at the vets. Maybe I should try this technique with him...
I'm gonna go on a limb and guess that it's not his first time
I should've been a vet ...fck !!!
I‚Äôd stop eating an apple a day for that.

That is some professional multi-tasking.
My vet is fantastic in every way, he reminds me of this guy a bit. 

He has tried everything, but my dog gets so afraid to the point of aggression. I‚Äôm so thankful he is so understanding and patient and tries to make her visits go fast and as stress free as possible. :/

Wiggling what he ain't got
He reminds me of my bulldog link sadly I haven't been able to see him for a couple of weeks they both have the exact same tail and his face is also 2 colors
As cute as this is, I would not recommend this as a general procedure. I‚Äôve been bit by many good boys while vaccinating as a vet tech. Definitely dont try this with a cat! You should always have two people (aka vet + owner or vet tech) when handling and calming nervous animals during this process. Chihuahuas are the most notorious.
I too, am distracted by peanut butter
As a lifelong dog owner, I can honestly say I've never had a dog as sweetly tempered and food motivated as my English Bulldogs.

They'll do anything for a snack. lol
I guess I have to tell my vet not to feed my dog peanut butter now. If he licked me after, I‚Äôd die lol
Omgggg what a cute doggo!!!!!
Uhuhtcutiee
The vet used to look at me like I was a crazy person when they asked me to help contain my old cat when he got his butt temp taken. I was like ‚Äúno- he will be fine. Trust me‚Äù. Sure enough- the fucker would start purring when they put the thermometer in. I miss my little freak.
Good vets are absolutely worth their weight in gold
Aww this made me smile :-)
This is so fucking adorable
Legit curiosity with humans an injection like that could fairly easily lead to an abscess, afaik. Gotta sterilize the shit out of the skin to avoid pushing bacteria under the skin.

This is in ref to intramuscular injections tho ;). Is this a subQ thing or what? Honest question
I wish my doctor did this, I love peanut butter

I always throw my cat treats so he plays fetch and gets excited for it, and, he was always so resistant to taking pills or drops though, I once dropped a pill he had to take and because of the similar noise, he ran and excitedly ate it thinking it was a treat and I realised I've been getting him to eat pills the wrong way for so long. Now I just throw them like they're treats and he doesn't know the difference

Watching this hurts my fvcking back
Smart - Dog or human, always bribe them with food ;D

Gonna be me one day I hope üí™
Vaccines shouldn‚Äôt be given in the scruff like that.  Good method, but poor execution.  Each vaccine has a designated limb they should be going in subcutaneously.
Awee
I just had to put my dog to rest yesterday. She hated vet visits. Her vets were never bad by any means, but I wish her vet would have been this cool. Then maybe her last few moments wouldn't have been in her least favorite place.  Kudos to this veterinarian.
That was fire bro
Those are some fast hands!!
What a legend
Magnifique.....ü§©
This is the schitts creek vet
Now that is a man doing a job he loves and it shows. Good to see.
It‚Äôs all fun and games, until you realize he‚Äôs putting the dog down
Some people in life were just made for their profession:)
Now try that with a cat.
^Finally something cool on reddit that I haven't seen before.^
This needs to the protocol at dentists. Id be able to go without a panic attack every year. 

LUCKY DOGGO <3
Good doggo, good vetto!
Psh, too bad pup‚Äôs got a peanut allergy
He just studied to be a vet because he wants to snuggle all the animals.
My $500 vet visits would feel better if mine were like this.
Ah the classic food bait
That final frame, the dog's like "WHERE'S THE REST OF THE PEANUT BUTTER?! I KNOW YOU HAVE MORE!"
I want to see him for my next doctors appointment üòä
Being a bulldog owner, I can confirm they are the most amazing pets.
Lmao
What a wonderful Vet!üêàüê∂üíú
Reminds me of them so called vaccinations being touted these days here‚Äôs some money , now inject this
You better stop with all this cuteness.
my man didn‚Äôt get to realize he got vaccinated
heard a opp was dead
Omg can he by my gynecologist?
The vet was great for sure. But how about how darn cute that butterball of a bulldog is????
He looks like his name should be Ted.
Whatif the doggo has but allergies and only eats organic gluten free almond butter?
Them crocs though .
Vets and doctors honestly should have to love their job to work there.
That dog is so cute.
He pretty stoopid.
Out of curiosity, how does the cost per injection compare to a pupper-sized dollop of peanut butter?
Awww he looks like such a great vet.
Yall know it work the same way with kids
So sweet!
$1000 bet to Camp Golden Years he couldn‚Äôt handle my 18 pound dog ‚ÄúTopper.‚Äù He‚Äôs my best friend.
u/savevideo
good man
a smart creative vet. I love it.
HUGE TO THE FCKING MOON üöÄ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That‚Äôs what doing what you love looks like
What a great person! Distract the pup and do what ya need to. I bet that pup loves to go to the vet!
If only my proctologist was this clever  things would have gone a lot smoother
That‚Äôs awesome. Vet visits will be a good memory.
I hope they give me peanut butter during my COVID vaccination.
Best vet ever!
Das a good good boy
LOL that little meatball trying to eat the spoon!
So, ummm, I'm going to expect this treatment when i get my COVID vaccine.
Plot twist he‚Äôs getting euthanized.
What a pro!
this man is a saint
People who love their jobs this much always puts a smile on my face.
Best vet since Dr Pol!
Thats a salesman right there. You want all the business you can handle, make it easy for the dog owner. My dogs love the vet. I live down the street from my vet. Everytime we start to walk in that direction, it is all I can do to keep my pups from pulling me that way.
How could you miss sinking a needle in dose rolls?
Thats one handsome bulldog right der.
Thats one handsome bulldog right der.
I'd lick his peanut butter. ;)
My dog is PETRIFIED of going to the vet she will not even want to go in. SHHEEESH i need this vet
There are so many doctors, following the same technique even on the human beings.
This works on humans. I gave an anti vaxxer peanut butter and it changed its mind.
That doesn't need to be injected into a particular place? Or he is just so good he can grab some flesh and know right where to stick it that fast?
