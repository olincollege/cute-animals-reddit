I like to think for a moment, it really is pure joy. And then it’s realization that this whole parenting thing is about to get even harder.
My boy was standing by the coffee table shuffling across until he dropped his favourite chew toy, he bent down to pick it up, one hand remaining on the table for stability, he stood back up and let go of the table to remove whatever dust speck dared tarnish his beloved rubber monkey. He had the look of concentration Indiana Jones had removing that urn from the pressure plate. So much so he forgot that he couldn't yet move upright without the aid of furniture. When he had finished his cleansing of said treasure he looked up and around with a look of realisation, he can go wherever the fuck he wanted, regardless of whether or not he was at all a competent walker. So he took a step towards me, then another then... Smash. He's one now and a complete menace to himself and my valued tech.
New dad here with a son who hasn't learned to walk: 

I fear this day with all my heart, but my back is so sore from carrying him around all the time that I also long for it.
My som refused to walk for a long time. I ended up handing him a lacrosse ball. It was too heavy for him to carry with one hand so he couldn't crawl while holding it. I saw the gears churning in his head as he decided to grab onto the ball with both hands. He then stood up and started walking like it was no big deal. He has not crawled since and has been an absolute handful to deal with as a result. But I still love every bit of him.
Reminds me of when my son walked for the first time. I had a grin on my face for a week.
First smile from Dad since Brady left...
The kid kind of looks like a drunk wanting to bar fight with his clenched fists haha.
As a dad who watched this happen three times, I can fully relate. It's one of the most joyous moments. <3
As a man planning to have kids in the near future, this made me tear up.
I’ve watched both of my kids take their first steps and it felt just like this. Called my wife instantly with joy. During both instances they just got up and started walking, really beautiful to see
I dunno I have 2 kids and when they both took their first steps, really was not impressed. I mean I've been walking for 35 years at this point, get good kid.
You spend the first two years getting them to walk and talk, then the next sixteen telling em to sit down and shut up.
I’ve been through this. It’s such a joy when you get to be a part of. Then, I realized (I dk who said it), “their first steps are the first for them walking away.” I’ve watched my kids grow and become more independent. I’m confident that they’ll be prepared to take on their own life but alas I don’t want them to go.
I love being a dad.
r/HappyCryingDads
This is my family! That 11 month old is almost 3 now and I love coming across this video again and again.
.
Dudes got some dainty feet
Even Pikachu seems impressed
I love the surprised pikachu in the background.
Dad who couldn't walk by himself for his entire life finally has a baby and when this happened he become emotionally happy.
Oh come on. He helps the kid get set what, three times? He’s cheating. The Patriots shirt should have been the first clue. /s
Sometimes I feel emotionally deficient.  

I would do anything for my kids, but I don't remember first steps or milestones, or feeling any sort of way about anything.   When I get a hug or a "Im happy with you daddy" I enjoy it, but I'm never emotionally effected like I am with "animals against the odds" movies.  

Birth?  Yep, it's a baby.  First steps?  He's walkin.  I dunno.  I feel like a John Wayne parody of a man sometimes and am not quite sure what (if anything) to do about it.
Spent a year strengthening my daughter's legs and helping her learn how to stand/walk. She waits until I was at work one night to stand up and start walking around on her own.
Even Pikachu is excited!
Repost but still love this moment of pure joy.
It really do be like that
That kid has won the lottery in the dad department
He'll be running the speed out in no time!
Pikachu approves too
This dude is gonna be hysterical when he learns about marathons
The switch from man to man defense to zone defense is nigh!!
That was more falling with style.
I had similar reaction when my son started to walk. It is big milestone. Even though most babies eventually walk just fine, these first steps open realm of possibilities for the baby (and more running for parents)
My mom burst out crying when she got my nephew's (her first grandbaby) first laugh. It was beautiful.
A buddy of mine is one of the toughest SOB’s I know. Had two girls, still mean as a mug but those girls turn him to putty.
My nieces first steps were too me. I never let my sister, or mother forget it lol
Lol damn it! My son is on the verge soon and this just got me choked up myself.
awwwwwww
So precious, love seeing men express joy
Awesome! I had a similar reaction. All the firsts really are amazing!
Valid amount of joy. Good dad. Quality fam moment.
Classic example of the most profound moments in life being the most common.
The happiness doesnt go away. It just grows more with everything else they learn. Before you know it, they run up to you after a bad day of work and say "hey daddy, i want juice" and all the worries go away and you just smile and say "sure bud, lets get you some juice"

You thought he was going to say something like i love you? Nah, this is a toddler were talking about. Theyre more worried about juice and snacks. Then he says thank you, love you!
I tell my son (15) often, “I’ve been proud of you since the moment you were born”.  This brought back so many of those little memories.
So cute baby
Good lad. Youre doing well
I usually have the same reaction after I spent an hour trying to poop and it finally comes out.
-weaps into hands- "go Pats"
Tim Brady must be so proud
Prob crying cause CamNewton was resigned.
A Patriots fan? I'm convinced this is an elaborate troll to show that Marshawn should have run it. Even a baby can go one yard.
This guy wants to be a Dad. Thats the best part.
In this moment, your entire life as a parent flashes before your eyes. You see the next 20 years all in a second, and nothing prepares you for it.
It's hard raising a kid. My little guy learned how to walk 2 months ago. I feel like he walks 4 km a day now.
Oh my God... His reaction is golden
Lucky bastard got it on camera too.
Moments like this make it all worth it. The joy I get in watching my toddler grow up is more than I have ever felt otherwise.
I was deployed when my first son learned to walk.  On an exercise for the second's first steps.    No more children.   I just cried experiencing that with this dude.   That was a weird 2 minutes.
I have twin daughters. Baby B started walking before 12 months, Baby A would only take steps if you held her hand. Once you let go of her hand she would topple over. At their 15 month check-up their pediatrician told us if Baby A continues this way at 16 months we may consider physical therapy to get her balance right. Literally right then and there she walked across the exam room.
What's the big deal? I walked like 100 steps today.
When the code finally runs without crashing...
Man I wish I could have kids somedays.
I wish all parents loved their kids this much.
Stop Reposting This. I'm tired of it. Plus theOP thinks you're a karma ho
God damn it here’s an upvote for making me cry
Feels more wholesome than aww
Wholesome ward comin
Epic happy moment ftw!
It's a moment where you are so happy for the milestone but also scared of the new unlocked skill.
Okay okay, some Patriot fans get a pass, I guess.
Happy tears are the best.
As a father, I know he is crying because now his son is going to be getting into hella shit
I did the same thing the other day when I taught my baby girl to day Hiya for the first time, my heart melted and I just started to cry.
Too bad he’s a patriot fan.
The look of pure joy and pride for the little kid.
I remember this with my daughter, I was so proud but also terrified at the same time
I remember my daughter started walking. She didn't crawl much really. She just got up to get a toy, did a few wobbly steps. First reaction was pure joy. But soon after I realized the house wasn't ready for a walking kid.
Been there. It’s a big deal man.
It seems like it'd be an amazing thing to have a dad who loves his son and is proud of his accomplishments.
My oldest son is 21, and I very clearly remember his first step. My reaction was almost identical. 

It's the first time you get a glimpse of the adult your adorable little blob will become. In an instant, you imagine all the steps they'll take in their lives, all the places they'll go and things they'll do. And how they'll walk away from you. Just like you hope and dread.
Dad’s inner thoughts: Omg he can finally walk! He took his first steps... his first steps away from me 😢
Being a dad is the best!
Pretty cool that both parents got to experience that together.
Great moment. I’m happy my reaction to my son’s first step was also captured. This is where it gets scary though haha
ITT: Parents cry reminiscing about milestones

Spoiler: Its me. I'm parents.
Even (some) Patriots fans have souls ♥️
I love this
The Joy's of father hood.  Shit feels good man.
He was overwhelmed with the thought of his son making him millions playing sports.
Its really nice to see men this emotional and happy
TOUCHDOWN!!!!
If this was posted by the guy in the video. Tim, is that you? 

Background, went to middle school with a guy who looks like this guy.
Of course he’s crying. He’s a Patriots fan.
I can walk better than that kid what the big deal?
I’ll never understand this... like, *how* do parents get so emotional and gobsmacked over this? He’s a little human, you already know he’s going to start walking at some point.
ok maybe i do want kids
Oh unbelievable. Almost every baby learns to walk at some point. Unbelievable that my baby is like almost any baby.
Before you ask, yes I have kids.
Set up a camera and make an exaggerated reaction, check
I read a comment from the wife in this video some years ago when this was posted. Very cute.
I'm blessed to have seen that four times with my own kids.
This was the wholesome content I needed today🙏
They go from taking 5 minutes to crawl a couple feet (pretty easy to supervise) to being able to get to the highest, most dangerous places in 5 seconds.
Dropping this message for his son when he gets older and if at all reads the comments here.
imagine your kid about to have one of the most important moments in his life and you have the camera turned to you to record your reaction for internet clout
After watching this for the 50th time this kid is probably doing his taxes by now.
Can confirm!  Husband cried
Now I want a little human just to see and experience that. 🥺
so wholesome i love it, when i become a parent i hope my husband would react like this. have joy and appreciation for what life we had made for ourselves and for our child.
Wait until you are there, its one of the moments that make parenting worth it.
It's such a wonderful thing to witness your child's first steps. But now you better put all your shit up somewhere high lol.
It’s just pure pride.
Kid looks like he boutta swing
Children are ugly creatures. Definitely not aww material.
[deleted]
I think this is such a beautiful analogy of the father/mother dynamic. We love our mother and walk towards her. She is the comfort that we seek. While the father is the one who provides structure, picks you up when you fall. But you walk away from him and do not see what he has done for you.
Now go lock EVERYTHING down.
Surprised Pikachu
As a Dad who struggles to show emotion, this warms my heart so much! ♥
That one hit me in the feels. 

Our little guy took his first steps a few weeks before his first birthday and it was part excitement, part fear.
ok i almost cried watching this. ty for posting
"You used to live in my balls."
Whatever.
I’ll set em up son, you knock em down :’)
Theres so many more to come. My friends used to say they couldn't understand having kids and not ripping my hair out. These moments are why
[deleted]
The crying bit looks a hit fake to me
I mean it was cool to see both my kids walk but at the same time it didnt really strike me emotionally. Its just one step closer to being able to walk to the conputer and game.
Even Pikachu was celebrating
AWWWWWWWWWWWW
Its a mixture of WOO HE LEARNT TO WALK and oh god oh fuck he walked
I had the same reaction
Beautiful
Yeah buddy!
Milestones...first all night sleep, first laugh, first steps, first words, first potty trained success, first day of school...enjoy and don't miss any...there are no do overs.
Love this.
It really is a magical moment and something I wish every human being in the world were able to experience.
Wholesome. My dad saw me walk and said
 “fuck it I’ve taught him all I can”
This is heckin' wholesome
As a parent I can confirm that seeing you first born take their first steps is like pure magic. Few things in life compare.
I see a dad with a Pikachu, i click upvote
That kid definitely earned a kiss on the mouth
Not a dad (yet) but I raised my little sister and I remember the pure joy of her taking her first steps in the living room. 🥺🥺🥺
Wait until he realizes the whole reason his kid learned to walk was for the express purpose of getting away from him.
😭
Lol, I was wearing Patriots gear too when my daughter started walking.  :)
Why is he so suprised and shocked? Thats why we have legs in the first place, we all walk.. Big woop
Dude’s a bit unnecessarily dramatic
My kid is one but started walking a couple months back. We never had any sort of emotional moment or anything. I think by that point, I had already lost my ability to feel. Now she’s walking anywhere, opening drawers, scattering all contents, hand in toilet, hiding the remotes, etc. When will this hell end. I’m WFH but my wife isn’t, so I’m working and taking care of the kid full time.
u/savevideo
That is one proud daddy, so wonderful to behold, see how his protective instinct clicked in when his son had a wobble, thank you for sharing 🥰🙏🏻
Kids walks to mommy’s arms, but only after daddy holds him up and straightens his legs into the best position.  Hooray for supportive dads!
So nice.

Also they will soon be able to share shoes!
Really weird to post this if it isn’t your moment. Weirdo.
Awwww his baby can walk. Like that's no big freaking deal. Get over yourself.
To bad he’s a pats fan
I wish I could be that emotional... thanks for wrecking that part of me Mom and Dad. 35 years old and have no emotion on that level towards my kids and I always wish I had.
I wish I felt this kind of emotion during those moments. He seems overwhelmed with happiness.
too bad he will grow up to be emotionally stunted child because his father is a Patriots fan
That's a fat W for the both of them
Funny to see first the anticipation to catch him and damn he walked wow 👍
Haha Go Pats!
Can confirm. I did the same thing. Pure joy. Not much else like it.
I dont understand this reaction... "omg my child is doing exactly what they're supposed to be!"
This is such a tragedy... soon we’ll have another Patriots fan walking among us...
I don’t have kids. Can someone explain why you would cry at a healthy baby learning to walk? I could see crying at their first word being momma or dada but this seems a bit odd to me unless the baby has overcome something I’m not aware of.
Calm down dad damn
New England Patriots. Yikes. Hopefully the kid is adopted
He cheated.
I was a nanny that saw baby’s first steps. I never said a word. Only a savage would steal that moment for a parent.
It goes from that’s adorable to get off the goddamn shed real quick.
patriots fan, clearly the son is cheating
Been there dad.
The pride of parenthood.... kinda crack -like.
“Millennials are killing the deadbeat dad industry” is my favorite quote of recent memory.
I can't wait to show my dad that I can walk as soon as he gets back from buying that pack of cigarettes.
My lil bastard is going to catch passes from old man Brady soon!!
Good job, baby Wes
Am I a horrible dad for not crying when my son started his first steps?
Yep, accurate
My dads first reaction was "Why couldn't he do three more?" Lol
I didn’t know patriot fans could be so wholesome
And thus the cycle begins where the son walks through life accomplishments while the dad watches from behind with tears of joy. 

The more time passes and the less he'll have to guard his sides to make sure he doesn't fall, and he'll cry just a bit more along the way. What a beautiful sight.
Your reaction when your *second child* walks.

"Oh no. She's walking. Fuck. It begins..."
Oh so sweet!!!
Oh, a Pats fan... that kid has a rough future ahead of him.
My cousin took his first steps to me, I was 15 or 16 and it's still one of the best feeling moments of my life
Damn, why did I give my wholesome award away!
I wish I got to see my daughters first steps rather than spending the day on the deck of an aircraft carrier an ocean away :(.  A video sent online isn't quite the same.
Not saying it’s for everyone, but speaking from experience, being a dad is the freaking best.
My wife delivered our first child 2 nights ago. I’m watching this from beside the hospital bed and I’m tearing up! Amazing to see that emotion and I’m so excited to join you in the dad club!
Way too adorable.
My daughter is trying to learn to crawl. She can sit her self up and crawl backwards. I’m sure it will happen soon.
Patriots fans don’t deserve this
I experienced this, and I know it is pure bliss.
Dude sick walking skills bro
He was probably thinking "My son is a future Pats player!"...
Same reaction when you see your son put on a furry suit.
I can feel his happiness from here
Nothing is safe, now
First time seeing a patriots fan and not immediately thinking “f u”, Tom being gone makes us friends now
Dad realized that the kid would probaly make the Patriots WR-group.
There aren't many things that make me as genuinely happy as seeing good dads.
that is so nice to see!
Combination of pure joy and exhaustion. Dat kid ain’t lettin him sleep.
Awwwwe he's a good papa !
It’s a truly elated joy when they take those steps.   Just love it.
Dude reminds me of an older steve Irwin
This kid and dad do physical therapy. I can tell by his proper adjustments and holding low on the body. First steps did wonders for teaching me how to help my little reach milestones. This is a big, proud day for them!
I walk every day, no big deal
I was watching a friend's kid while they got some sleep several years ago.  The kid took his first steps with me.   I never told them
Off camera to the right is a very steep cliff, the arms failed to catch the boy. This is so sad
I think about how wholesome this is then realize someone set up a camera so it’s all for views. Tough
i dont care about your children, i came here for cute animals
Can we get a sons reaction to his father walking to the store please.
 Parents spend the first few years of their kids ’ lives trying to get them to walk and talk, then the next few trying to get them to sit down and shut the fuck up.
eh I thought this sub was for animals
As I’m raising my first son I find something strange. We as parents try so hard to help our kids grow up and learn new things, but at the same time, we want them to stay as young and little as possible. Just a thought.
next up:

"That Escalated Quickly"
First steps to his mom the next are to his dorm
Hell yeah!
Geez, they don't give much back do they. Thank God when they start walking, at least it's something.
The look at the end.
Crying cause it’s the beginning of the end now
Nanny here! This daddy did a great job helping - when your bubs are learning to walk, you want to stabilize their **hips** and it's best if you're on the floor with them. Lots of times people want to help littles walk by holding their arms and hands, and yes, this is great when they're already walking cuz the little cherubs will trip over literally nothing and then suddenly they're free-dangling by their wrists and the only thing saving their little helpless bodies is your grip.

But when they're taking those first precious steps, get down on the floor with them and grab their hips! Their upper bodies are great at stabilizing themselves from all the core workouts they've been doing just sitting there. It's their leggies that are wonky. They wobble a lot and are doing two different things at the same time and it's super hard to get right when you haven't had the practice!!:) Being on the floor puts you within arms reach in case they start to faceplant. Their hands and arms are REALLY great at catching them - babies have the same instincts during falling that adults have and are good at managing their tumbles. However, sometimes our instincts aren't fast enough or our brains just totally misfire or something unexpected happens like falling sideways into the corner of the coffee table, and that's when it's rad to have somebody there to help out, and if course it's always helpful if that somebody is within reach!

I wrote a post like this the last time I saw this get posted and a new parent sent me a DM saying I helped their baby take their first steps!! :)) They'd been helping baby by holding hands and the baby did great while, essentially, being held up, but babe was really struggling to take independent steps. Mom and Dad changed up their tactic, held dem hips, sat down on the floor, and baby took off like a rocket.

In case there are any new moms and dads out there, your bubby might be more ready than you think!! Hips are helpful and I have personally seen with my own eyes, on several occasions with several different children, how quickly the wees get the hang of one-foot-then-the-other. Try new tactics, and make sure they're barefoot and that the area you're working with them in is safe for them to be barefoot as much as possible!! Shoes aren't great unless barefoot isn't an option, and even then, it has to be something with a very soft, very malleable sole. I really love leather-soled shoes if you absolutely can't trust your bare floors with their tootsies. Hard-soled shoes or shoes with flat bottoms will delay their walking and will make it difficult for them to understand the way that their feet interact with the ground. You can start barefoot, then go to shoes, but it's really hard to go the other way around and can even cause some problems with their feet, walk cycle, stride, toes, and other things. Set their piggies free:)
r/happycryingdads
From their first steps it’s about a day and a half until they are running full tilt into danger.
As a dad of s tiny little one, I already cried now. Imagine when mine walks...
Me: That's adorable.

Also Me: Not a Patriots fan!
Pft whatever, I do that everyday, you don’t see me getting applause
that wasn’t “walking”. that was falling with style. no but in all seriousness thats pure joy right there
One week later he's chasing that toddler that doesn't understand no moving quite fast. I remember a period where the potential for mayhem and self harm was pretty high. Of course it's all a blur because we were so damn tired.
How to get your son to be QB for Patriots step 1
This is equally the best day ever for the dad and the last of the best days. That little dude is about to destroy everything.
Wait until you notice Pikachu reaction.
And in those short 10 seconds, he now has more rushing yards than NFL Legend Tom Brady. Future HoF.
Dad's* reaction

Use a possessive noun, not a singular.  Sheesh.
Judging by the shirt I’d say there was some foul play
I envy this man. I missed the first steps of all my kids while I was at work.
Watching a human being that you made take their first steps is a ***VERY*** emotional and surreal moment. Shortly after my kid  started walking I remember passing by her without any interaction on my way into the kitchen and she was on her way out. It was crazy feeling, she had her own agenda and was doing her own thing fully separate from me for the first time.
Downvoted, he's a patriots fan.













/s
I laughed when the kid spread his stance back out like "fuck bro, one step at a time!"
Uhh. Is it just me or is he the MTV Veejay guy? Dave something or something.
I look at this video but the Pokémon plush i feel like is starring into my soul
Like watching Cam under centre last year
Priceless..... he’s a proud Daddy!!
That was a heavy gulp!!
Both my parents didn’t see my first steps. Dad was working, mom at Uni. Grandparents saw them
Must’ve heard the Tom Brady trade to Tampa in the background
My mom says my first steps were on Father’s Day.
My daughter is a year and a half. That was one of the most emotional moments of my life watching her take her first steps. Obviously you are opening pandora's box as to what they can now get into, but I can assure you that isn't what he was thinking at the time. That is pure joy and pride in his eyes.
Allllllllll uphill from there
I really hope I get to experience that feeling one day
There is a connection the crawling and the writing and reading, like spine and brain
Crawling is very important
Go pats
Precious moments and first words , first hair cut , first everything!!!!!
We love and have emotions too.
My exact reaction from earlier today when I discovered that a weed strain was named after my musical pseudonym
So pure.
I have a 14 month old. This reaction and feeling is still so fresh that watching this video made my cry. It’s one of those moments where your child - who for their whole existence has felt so small and passive - suddenly feels like a totally different person. There is a realization that, “my whole life is about to get harder.” But seeing that inflection point of them becoming that little more independent is so amazing.

Its challenging - being a parent. But there are so many little things like this that have completely renewed my love for living.
Why no sound?
They grow up so fast...
Get used to this, Patriots fans
I missed my daughter's first steps a few months ago. She started walking shortly after leaving for my current deployment. However, my son was born in February and I'm really hoping I get to be there for his in the coming months. Thank you for the smile; I needed it tonight.
That pride.
Wish there was sound! It was a lovely moment, but would have been so much more with sound.
I have a one year old who started walking at 8 months, he's a straight up terrorist.
Took his first steps towards a football scholarship..
too bad he'll grow up a pats fan.../s
I got that same feeling when my son learned how to ride a bike too. When he struggled all day to keep his balance but kept at it until he mastered it. Proud as fuck, definitely teared up watching him pedal away.
Jealous of that kid...
That’s what I should have done...

Not yell (but still joyfully) “You came out my balls!!”
This is going to be me. Even the smallest thing makes me cry lol so my child taking some steps is going to be awesome. I can't wait to be a proud dad.
A man of culture, with that pikachu in the background
I wanna be a dad :(
Me moving the legs of a figurine around until it stands on its own.
As someone who missed his first sons first steps, I felt this in my soul.
Pikachu supportive as fuck
Dad: never cries

Baby : does literally anything anyone can do 
Dad: cries
Plugs, secure all the plugs. Gates don't really work, they will very short term but kids are Sponges and will quickly see you A: just step over them (they are surprisingly adept climbers) or B: see how the latch works. Above all enjoy those years, it goes by way to fast.
The realization that he will never have another peaceful moment for the next few years.
You will never understand this if you don’t have kids.
This really brightened my so far terrible day.
Damn bro, I witnessed both my little bro’s first steps as well, not really the same
Probably the same reaction when Tom Brady left the Patriots
I know the feel! it's like every first new thing they do.... It's truly wonderful!
A few seconds and you can already tell that this little boy means the world to this man.
Is it weird that I just want the Pikachu xD
i wish my dad was as proud of me as this man was at his son
It's a beautiful moment, every time.
Is it allergy season?
I cried when my son first walked like this guy. There are really no words to describe the feeling. He's a bit older now and that feeling of oh shit what have I done happens more often
This is precious. What a good dad
New dad, 16 months. He was crawling for a while.and then one day he just stood up and stood there for a while. About a week later he did it again except he took a step... Then another.... Then another picking up speed until he smashed into the baby gate. That was months ago, not he waddles around flailing his arms and screaming some toddler battle cry.
As a relatively new dad, yep, that’s how it feels.  It kind of feels like that whenever they do something new.  This morning our daughter asked for a book by name for the first time, and proceeded to page through it herself while sitting bed.  She’s 19 months old. My heart damn near burst out of my chest.
"Oh my god, that's amazing!... [I'M GETTING THE NERF BLASTER!](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/mee2rj/war_is_brutal/)"
He reacted like he was previously told his child would never walk.
My wife and I are in our mid 20s literally all the time..
Usually seeing humans on the aww subreddit us not good but this, this is acceptable
Are we 100% sure he isn’t crying because he just realized he’s a Patriots fan?
Yeah but he like set the kid up to walk not like he did it on his own.
*Happy Pikachu Face*
Why aRe yoU RunNinG?...WHY are You RunNinG???.......
Holy shit but that takes me back...


I'M not crying; YOU'RE crying!!!
Baby legs, go! Cooooooo
Its deflated xD
Cheers to a wonderful dad and his beautiful family!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️
Pats fan, the kid must have had underinflated shoes.  


Actually such a great moment to witness as a parent
As a father to a son who took his first steps closer to 1.5 y/o with a lot of physical therapy, totally relating to this elation.
this is gonna be me when all my kid does is go potty in his little diapie 😌
And then the first time you turn around and BAM, there’s your child right behind you who was just in the other room. And you’re thinking, where did this little fucker come from? I almost ran over him/her.
trẻ con thật thú vị
Pikachu didn't cry. Pikachu is clearly a better parent.
That is such a beautiful thing to see.
I swear the caption said dad reaction to his first step sons
Walmart tom brady!
Even the Pikachu in the back is ecstatic!
He kind of nudged his kid into it too. The way he set the kids up he was tipped forward. The first step was just to not fall then baby just ran with it
Patriots fan. The kid probably cheated to walk.
Ye of little faith pop! 

- As the good Lord DarkVader said: your lack of faith is disturbing, ya turd.
he cried because he realized that Patriots sucks
You always want them to walk and talk, shortly thereafter you want them to sit down and be quiet....lol
😍 He just doesn't know it yet ... he is royaly screwed.
That realization that as soon as they can walk..they turn into accidental suicide machines.
bru dat wholesome af
Now I feel like a bad dad. I just got pumped lol
My granddaughter, like her mother, started walking at 9 months. Two days later, I get a text: "She runs."
Had pikachu cheering him on in the back
This guy
Got secondhand pride tears from this and I’m nowhere near old enough to want a kid. God damnit.
I literally walk everyday and all my dad ever does is call me a queer
Awww he stayed in frame!!
Old Brady holding up mahomes
I have a very similar video. My reaction was exactly the same.
Go Dolphins
My son started walking two hours ago! The. This turns up on my Reddit feed!
His reaction is everything
41 - 33 🦅
Pikachu! Pika!
My first born is 4 months. I almost cried watching this
My wife is at 20 weeks with our first and honestly while naturally there’s trepidation, I really resent the fact that parenthood, and by extension motherhood, is now looked upon as something secondary, or even something to scorn, in our time. Certainly not something to strive for, along with just a normal stable relationship. 

It’s going to be tough when it arrives and they’ll fuck around until they’re 18 then basically disappear, but I know it’s going to be so rewarding. Like a cosmic shift in priorities and actually giving a genuine meaning to my life. 

Tl;dr Vid made me excited
what a truly blessed family!!!
Absolutely Gold!
QWOP
Go pats
Just last year around this time my kiddo was learning to walk... We recently bought one of those backpacks owth a leash. She wants to run everywhere and I just want a nice normal walk so this has been very handy. It's better than running after her or carrying an angry toddler who is crying and screaming and doing everything for you to put them down.
Time goes fast.
I'm surprised he didn't feel...deflated?

I'll see myself out...
1. This is hecking cute and I can't wait to watch my kids take their first steps

2. I feel much better about how nervous I get about kids hurting themselves after watching him trying so hard not to freak out and let his kid walk on their own. I usually feel so bad that I can't handle watching the 2 year old play on a trampoline because I'm afraid they'll get hurt, or I think they're about to get hurt and scare them trying to save them... I once knocked my 1 year old cousin over because I thought he was going to grab a plate with hot food on it and dump it on himself. I remember a very very long slow mo replay of him going down making perfect eye contact, hitting the ground, and sliding several feet with his diaper on the linoleum, still making eye contact... and still feel really bad about it to this day.

3. Have I mentioned I feel a bit better about that?
Damn Patriots fans...
The moment when he realizes that the real baby proofing begins.
Raise hands who cryied because have no dad
I think the emotion is cause he looked down and seen he was wearing a patriots shirt and started missing Tom Brady all over again.
I miss you Dad.
Sorry to be the wet noodle, but this is what all kids learn to do.
I remember when my son stood for the first time, we were concerned because he wasn't standing on his own at a time he should have been. We were in the living room, actively talking about it when he just stood up and looked around. I stopped mid conversation, looked down and realized what happen. It took my wife a second or two longer, we both happy cried.

I'm so happy for this guy, he has such joy and love in this video.
Beautiful moment
Pikachu is absolutely losing his shit in the background too!
"omg my son walks like a spaz"
He was obviously cheating with that pats shirt on
Kid unlocks a new feature, and so the difficulty of the parenting game comes with new challenges.
Pats still suck.
LFG FTJ! Go Pats!
The little boy looks like a mini-him replica of his dad minus the beard :)
My youngest son was 8 months old and thought the piece of newspaper he had picked up on the coffee table was holding him up as he walked 4 or 5 steps to the chair. A couple weeks later he was full out running.  
He's 36 and still can't sit still.
Fucking Patriots fans
Those hands though faster than a speeding bullet.
That proud dads brain in the moment
"Got the next Tom Brady on our hands!"
Awwww so cute
Is that tackle berry from police academy?
Fast forward 14yrs. I hate my dad! He won't let me do........
Best feeling ever!
i’m drunk and i watched this and now i’m crying
It was wonderful until I noticed he was wearing a Patriots shirt... Nah still wonderful. He gets a single pass.
Now all the trouble starts.
Children are such a blessing
Go Pats!
It’s truly one of the most satisfying moments in a parents’ life. 

“I made that!!!”
Yeah....this is one of those moments that'll reduce any dad to a quivering mess.
Dad has the smallest feet
As a dad, I can tell y'all it's a hell of a feeling. Until 2 months later and the kid wont stop running and climbing on things.
My daughter did this at 9 months. I giggled uncontrollably and almost cried. Never knew something like that can tremble you like that.
He’s doing it for the camera for this reddit post
My man is popping off this should’ve been streamed
My little lad was cruising the sofa and footstool when I knelt down near on the floor. He just turned around, and toddled a few steps and into my arms. As my jaw hit the floor he giggled a beautiful giggle in my ear that said he knew exactly what he'd just done and was proud of himself. It was wonderful. 

Not long later running hugs became a thing and he's now 8 and we are making the most of every running, or surprise hug, all the hugs, and we 'fill him up with hugs' and his soft toys, in the know that it won't be this way forever.
Is the dad unable to walk? I don’t understand his reaction
I had a similar reaction when our son was almost 2. He was born a premie at 26 weeks at 2 lbs. we were told he would have development issues and growth delays so every milestone was amplified. He is a healthy 6 year old now but those early years were nerve wrecking.
His little boy walking away reminded him of how Tom Brady walked away from the patriots and won another ring.
This post in r/aww is.... Acceptable.
Dude, save some of that for when the next kid starts walking!
Beautiful
I’ll get downvoted for the truth... but this is a snowflake dad. 
This kid will grow up to some amazing more things than 99.99999999999% of all humans and apes.
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
He's actually just remembering that the Pats didn't go to the super bowl this year.
HUG THAT MAN
That wasn’t walking, that was falling.....with style!
I cry constantly now that i have a son. Looking at the monitor - tears. He eats some egg - tears. Shit is wild i never was that emotional. Except maybe pixar movies.
Such a proud Dad.
Surprised pickachu face.jpg
It's such a cool moment to experience, I reacted pretty much exactly the same.
Bliss! Congrats, Dad. I love how overwhelmed with emotion he was.
And the next few decades you try to keep up with those little feet...
Amogus man
My son is at this stage right now made my day
I remember that feeling. I was so happy I could cry. 2 days later I realized everything was now within his reach. Life has never been the same.
“You’ve taken your first step into a larger world.”
He so happy!
❤️❤️this
This is a beautiful moment. I was choked up myself! 👏🏽🥰💯☺️🥳
Awwwww, that is so cute and sweet, it is gonna be a moment he never forgets, much like the two super bowls his Patriots lost to my Giants, ha! Go Big Blue!!!!! And lil baby, you go too little guy, I joke, but your first steps are way cooler and you have a pops with an obviously huge heart :D
Pikachu approves of this.
As a patriots fan, that will be the only joy he has for years
Priceless
I didn't get to see my son's first steps.  He was at daycare because his mother and I had to work to support us.  Now I'm sad all over again.
Why do I have the feeling, that he is going to be an amazing father?
I remember when my son first learned to walk..what a epic moment..now we destroy sweats in Warzone..
This video is a few years old, unless there is one exactly like it.
What am I supposed to be seeing?
*cats in the cradle...*
r/happycryingdads
After spending my daughters first birthday having a blast at an aquarium, we went home to wind down. I was cuddling her when she get fidgety so I stood her on the floor, getting ready to walk around with her. She had other plans and took a good 3 or 4 steps by herself towards one of her toys. She never showed interest before this in walking by herself. We were STUNNED and overwhelmed with emotions like the father here. However, I was more upset because I insisted we couldn't celebrate her bday for fear of her not being a baby anymore, and then this happened.
I did that when my son was 6 and could finally wipe his own ass
As a dad I know how absolutely proud this man is feeling.
I cried when my daughter took her first step, that’s 20 years ago, time flies!
These socks belong in the laundry...
Oh how heart warming, little miracles happen everyday
I think the baby's is a paid actor
Looks like there's two babies in this video
You know in his mind it’s like “there’s one step closer to being the next Tom Brady”
My son is 6 months old and I am dying for this moment! I hope we both cry
The first steps...of him walking all the way to the Bucs !
"shit, now I gotta put a lock on the silverware drawer"
Le’s goooooooooooooo
That’s a good dad. ❤️
The pikachu in the background looks like he’s cheering him on
Currently feeding my 10 week old and browsing Reddit. I can’t wait for this moment.
*sees child take first steps*

*discovers the fear of a moving child*
Is the dad paralyzed? Is that why it's super meaningful to him? His legs are not in proportion with his body so maybe?
He know ma his PlayStation is no longer safe that’s why he is crying
It was an really nice gif until i saw he's a Patriots fan...
Actually just heard they traded Brady.
Is this John DiMaggio??
Pikachu!!!!⚡️
Go Pats!
 Future Jules Edelman in the making.  Go Pats!
u/savevideo
Pats fans must not have much to cheer about nowadays huh
I can tell that your father is going to be a fantastic grandpa OP
It’s MTVs Dave Holmes isn’t it
That's wonderful!
Both my sons walked first at my Mom's house using the same coffee table for support and as a starting spot.
I like to take a moment and point out this special moment was taken from me from a very selfish mother who wanted to have children and then remain single to benefit the single mother life. SMH
I wish for this, but at this rate with my conditions I may never have a natural child...
u/savevideo
Dad-pog?!
What a sensitive littl bitch
He had the same reaction when Brady left...
He runs just like Brady!
Imagine his reaction after his son's first Nobel Prize.
As a father of two can someone tell me why my eyes are raining?
My man’s emotional state is just temporarily out-of-envelope, he will be fine. Bless him ❤️
It is just small steps for a small man, but a great leap for his beloved dad...
He really didn’t want to let him go
What a bitch.
Good. Now he can begin mowing the lawn and walking the dog too.
What a great dad. He will be misled into liking the patriots because FTP.
thta the reaction of my dad when my little sister does anything.
Dad's wearing a Patriots shirt, the kid has been trying to leave his whole life! 🤣
Dad realized he's gonna be a pain in the ass from now..
Does he perhaps sit in a wheelchair, the dad? If so, then this is even more sweet
After the season the Pat's had, he could use some positivity.
I’ve seen this so many times. How about a Where are They Now? Kid has his permit and is crying for very different reasons
First off, background Pikachu for the win.
Second, that is truly wholesome. Powerful emotions there.
This happened two months ago for me. What an incredible moment... I remember it like it happened a second ago. Congratulations.
But you should have seen him when Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl
I love how when the baby took its first step dad reflex’s kicked in and thought he was falling and tries to catch him
Like watching Belichick try to coach without Brady.  Everything little thing feels like an accomplishment
r/happycryingdads
The next time dad experiences that much joy will ironically be the day his son moves out.
Kid’s already got a better 40 that Tom Brady
This would have been more emotional for me if the guy wasn't wearing a Patriots shirt
Lol. 
Humans: walking all the time
Humans when tiny humans learn to walk: 😢 HE DID ITTTT!!!
Yes! The words failed me haha
1st child, "OMG! Look! Oh wow! This is the best ever!" Second child "Wow, good job bud!" Third child, "Hey did you see Jinny walked yesterday?" Fourth child, "oh you are walking now?" Fifth child, "have you seen Rebecca?"
The pikachu teddy 😍
r/happycryingdads
YES this is very sweet and I'm sure it's been said MANY times already but it bears repeating again that...this man is a patriots fan!  And well. He's gonna raise that seemingly sweet innocent child...to be a patriots fan...

When. Will. It. Stop?
Just had our gender reveal today, I can only imagine what that feels like. Congrats!
That was also my reaction anytime Tom Brady ran for a first down between 2008-2019
What would be Dad’s reaction to the first sex of his son? 🙃
Achievement unlocked: Mini-Terrorist
Insert obligatory "Men ain't Shit" meme here. This is why you need Fathers at home.
why i didn't react like this? What is wrong with me?
This is so wholesome, i truly hope my dad will react like this when i take my first step.
Almost 40 years ago to the day, my eldest son began wandering between the chair and couch about 10 minutes before bedtime, the night before his first birthday. I was pretty much in the same state.
This wouldn't be my dad my dad would have been like since you can walk let's focus on running now💀
Why did I end up dating a narcissist when angels like him exist? 😖
He is just like "omg whoah....*puts face in his hands and thinks* If I don't get a FUCKING NAP THIS KID BETTER START RUNNING NOT WALKING"
@u/leahboo_
[deleted]
He’s got the same reaction  watching Cam Newton
He's actually crying because he remembered the patriots resigned Cam Newton
F the Patriots
Beautiful.
Thays a bit much for.t first steps.  It'd a good occasion.  But not that good
I imagine him being disappointed because Tom Brady walked at a younger age
 Musta been like Ey! He can walk! and then like Shit, he can walk.
Most other people: I said hold on honey!! I just need to finish this email. Wait I missed what now?
lol
What about the mom's reaction? Videos about babies are almost always about the fathers. What about how excited mom is?
I see we’re still Rewarding men for doing the lowest, basic standards of parenting. Why though? This isn’t just admitting there’s a staggering problem with the gender roles but then going onto celebrate it.
Cool! Someone should dub it with the 2001: Space Odyssey intro. :-)

Edit: [Scratching my head] Why the down-votes? Having dramatic music at people's significant moment warrant a down-vote?! What logic is it?
That is very sweet. He shouldn’t walk around with shit on his shirt though, he should go clean that shit off.
[deleted]
Time to remember not to push your baby towards walking to tell everyone how early it started.
What is so special about this? I understand the emotion, but not the overwhelming emotion. Maybe the baby had an underlaying condition perhaps?
FTP
Pats shirt and a dip in his lip, this guy checks out!
Imagine how much dad cried when Tom Brady left for Tampa.
Go pats
Beta
We're going to the Superbowl!
Bradytard
Yo también pase por eso y la verdad que es algo hermoso ♥️ Fui madre joven . Y como soy bailarina estuve en el circo todas 3 años  y mi nena nació ahí , y aprendio  a caminar en el escenario 🤩
What the fuck, is he going did an Oscar? Jesus...
Dads the real baby here
For me it was the realization that one day theyre walking, the next day they’re moving into their own apartment 😞

Time flies. Cherish it.
Must be his 1st child ..... he would of pushed them over otherwise 💯🤣
Pats fan
E
Thats wholesome
Exciting 😇
😍❤️❤️❤️
u/savevideo
I wish my dad was this proud of me at any stage of my life 😌
Love the reaction! Love the first steps so beautiful. That being said the patriots shirt makes me angry 😂
This is r/aaw nobody wants to see babys!
They really gotta get the estrogen out the water
Geez, what a baby. The dad crying a little bit is also very, very, heartwarming. That baby though... What a baby.
I thought this was entirely wholesome until I saw his shirt
❤️loved it!❤️
LMAO
Love it, regardless the T-shirt 😁
Almost awarded this my wholesale but saw he was wearing a Patriots shirt at the last second. Close call.
But he's a Pats fan so fuck him.
To bad he’s a patriots fan
Not as wholesome when you learned he deflated the kid a bit first
Ewww a patriots fan
I really wanted to give you an upvote, but there's that Patriot t-shirt..........
Something something white terrorism
