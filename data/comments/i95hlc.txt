I've seen this before did you post it on another sub?
At the risk of raining on the parade: 

Generally speaking, dogs don't like this. Being poked in the face is unpleasant for dogs too, and their nose is particularly sensitive. They might put up with it more than a person would, but that doesn't mean they like it. See how he tries to avoid it a couple times?

I swear ive seen this 60 times on this sub
100 awards for the same fucking post every week
Incredible how many people in this thread willing to insult others because they would rather give a dog the benefit of the doubt. Y'all need therapy and some loving parents
i still doubt that's a smile
I swear I see this post once a week.
my dog came in panting and i thought i had the sound and was freaked out tryna figure where it was coming from
.
Eat your face
Dogs smile with their tails, they don't smile with their mouth... sorry to say this.

When the dog opens it's skin around his mouth like that, that's not a smile. That's him breathing heavier.

It's not smiling. It's panting. You're anthropomorphising an animal for no reason.
Love this so much
Oh my god. Gorgeous pup.

Dog hates it. You can tell.

No thanks on the pitbull stuff.

Pitbulls, one of the most adorable yet strongest dogs alive

I love pittbulls with all my heart but this isn‚Äôt a smile, don‚Äôt do that shit they don‚Äôt like it.
Wow. That‚Äôs a prance!
I used to boop my German Shepard‚Äôs nose all the time and she used to look at me with a confused look on her face. She was like, ‚ÄúHooman, what are you doing?‚Äù

nice repost
I read this and somehow my mind went to the ‚Äúdroop snoot‚Äù meme
Nice
Awwwwww
Hahaha, sort by controversial and look at all those banned comments. Mods don't want people mentioning this cute little pupperino had a 50/50 chance of biting the lady's hand off.
Please tell what kind of dog it is?
Saw this months ago it‚Äôs still one of my favorite things in the whole world
ah i love pittie smiles!! they‚Äôre so genuine and wholesome
70% of all pits attack a human and injure them in their lifetime. This usually occurs from ages 6.  

They are bred to fight.  The "nanny" dog of many years ago is long gone. 

If you own a pit, you are a bad person.  Seriously, you have a 300% higher chance of being a criminal.   Pits are bad dogs for bad people.

It is time to end the breed.
Damn, what a smile

Such a gooooood boy! (Or girl) Where is his treat??!
That's one ugly piece of shit

I bet this dog hurt someone.

The fuck you doing girl?
It looks like a Snapchat tongue
Ah, that's adorable!
I love pit bulls. My aunt used to have a couple of surprisingly friendly ones. I used to hate that smile, but I grew to love that smile as I grew less afraid of them. The oldest passed away a few years ago, and this one reminds me of her when she was small. I just want to say, thank you for the nostalgia and wholesomeness. It really made my day.
I like dogs.

So cute
The BEST smile on planet earth. The best.

Idk if I‚Äôll ever own a pit, being partial to retriever and lab aesthetics. That being said, I love how pits smile. So damn adorable.

I love how when he taps twice again the dog is so confused as to what to do

What's with all of the Debbie Downers trolling r/aww lately? Anything with a pitbull/Staffordshire or claiming the dog is smiling (does it really matter if it really is or not!?) gets a visit from the grumpy army. Can't have one corner of Reddit without get shit on, can we?

I click my tongue when I boop my pocket pit. And I ask her why her nose makes that sound. Been doing it for 6 years. I wonder if she‚Äôs sick of my shit yet.

I guess this offended people. Kiss my ass.
That is hilarious and beautiful! What a lovely smile. Makes my heart smile back.
Why do i feel after the second boop, the tongue's animated... No Offense OP

HOW TO TURN OFF?????
Man Reddit loves upvoting pit bulls almost as much as pictures of minorities and/or interracial couples doing nothing.
