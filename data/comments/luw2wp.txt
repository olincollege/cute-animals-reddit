This will be back under the stove absolutely immediately
So cute. Love how one is hugging the other. Hope they got their toy back!
Exactly 17 seconds later, they put it back under there.
"It's ok... Don't worry, human will get it. I've seen it done before!"
Yup. Only own a yard stick so I can retrieve toys from under the couch and stove.
[deleted]
Oh my gosh the paw on top of the other cat <3
"Don't worry, Sterling, our human is a professional. You'll have that catnip toy back before you know it."

"Cooper man I'm fiendin' hard. I don't know how much longer I can stand it."

"Fuck's sake, Sterling."
Something tells me this is not their first rodeo.
This reminds me of my cat Henry. He was forever losing his mice and when I'd ask him where his toys were, he'd go look under the couch or the stove or the closet door so I could rescue them.
My dog is the same except she gets her toys under the shelf the TV sits on and the couch.
[deleted]
some years ago my brother was in this internet video where a guy gets transported under the stove and it's like a bank for cat toys. He's the guy behind the desk.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc2PVl4SqzI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc2PVl4SqzI)
my cat comes and tells me lmfao. Like she takes on an intense posture and sounds like shes literally asking me
It’s the paw on the other kitty’s back, for me
My Dad’s cats used to do this. They’d get all the toys stuck under the fridge and then would wait until I came over and yell at me until I got their toys back.
I watched this entirely too long before realizing that it was not a video.

"Get the maus so we may chase it once more, hooman!"

Five seconds later...

"Hooman! The maus again hides beneath the hawt metuhl bawks! Da coward! Da fool!"
That cat looks cute with their arm on their little friend but in reality its leverage so when the toy appears Orange can get it first.
Im gonna get it ... nope Im gonna... no way im gonna... no way!! LOL
Very beautiful cats
I love the support system
Laughing out loud. Me and MY cats, including, it looks like, the implement you are using to get it. Our favorites are springs and those little mice that are sold in bulk.
“It’s gonna be OK; they’re a professional.”
But did you retrieve it?
Wish I could give you 2 upvotes for making me smile! I love this!

BTW what else did you find under there?
Oh man, I totally get this pic as I was trying to retrieve my cats toys from under the fridge while they watch on..
Been there done that. The sofa is fun too! Lots of prizes there.
My cat does the same when I have to get all of my hair ties from under the sink cabinet.
I love that your cat has an emotional support animal
I was doing the same thing a couple weeks ago and out from underneath the stove I flung a live mouse out! My three dogs went crazy trying to get it. The mouse made it into the living room and hide behind the heavy oak wall units.

That mouse owns my house right now. It’s stripped the traps of peanut butter 5 times.

My dogs are just too slow.
This happened to our cats so often I decided to Go and buy a couple of black pool noodles, cut it to length and jam it under the fridge and stove, it's not 100% but it definitely reduced this by like 95%. Make sure to cut some shorter ones to fill in the gaps on the side if gap exists.
Your cats let you have hand towels?
I love the cat with his paw on the other.

***Its not long now son! Playtime shall commence!***
This is nearly r/AccidentalRenaissance material

^crosspost?
“Perform your function slave. Retrieve my dearest wife’s plaything at once!”
Ah, yes.  toy retrieval, the Purrfect Feline Pastime.
I am deeply impressed by those clean floors. Right in front of the stove? In a house with two long haired cats and at least one child?! A+
I had to do this same thing today.  My cat was sticking his arm under the stove to retrieve his lost toy so I grabbed a yardstick and swooped it out with about 8 other toys.  Then he ate a raw noodle that was under the stove because he’s a derp.
If you haven't done this for your cat, does your cat even own you?
I have so been there!
Oh, I know this game.  They'll bat it right back under there.  I guarantee it.
My husband took apart and cleaned our sectional today. He kept bring cat/dog toys to me. Also color pencils. I guess we all lose our toys to the couch.
That "support paw' awwwmg!
One of my cats used to love checking under things for stuff. It was one of his favorite activities. But he wasn't super good at it. He would march back and forth in between me and whatever I was looking under, and would duck his head down occasionally to help look. But he never grasped the idea that he was usually blocking my vision and/or flashlight.

But he got excited any time I got in the floor to look under something. He lived till he was 16, and looking under furniture for stuff never got old. Any time we were lucky enough to find a toy was just a bonus.
Orange cat: "Calm down bro. The human's got this."
Im stoned and it took me fifteen seconds to realize this was not a video or gif. LOL "Wow those cats are really patient."
My cat thinks that clothes hangers conjure springs and ping pong balls so he asks for me to use them even when there is NOTHING UNDER THE FRIDGE AND OR OVEN
(Brown cat to grey cat) don’t worry, we’ll get it back.
brown cat is like
it's going to be okay mary we almost have it don't lose hope I'm with you
Tell me how I thought this was a video 🙄

Sat here staring at the damn picture for a solid 20 seconds at least 😭
HYSTERICAL!!!
You know stoves pull out very easily right? Great way to clean back there too.
This! I do this exact thing. My two try and get in front of my face while I'm looking under the fridge with my grabber stick.
We ritually do this every day with a bamboo stick under the sofa. Delighted it's not just our fur friend here!
It's happening, brother! Soon we will be reunited with crusty foam ball #3489b. That was a great ball! Can't wait to push it under here again!
You do know that you can pull that drawer out and have full access to beneath the stove don’t you?
This is what it totally looks like when my cats would inform me of a possible mouse spotting. 


More recently it’s been a noise in the ceiling, and if posting pictures to reddit didn’t suck so much, I would share their 3am “what’s that in the ceiling” poses.
We announce this in our household as, “Getting the Getter.” The “Getter” being a giant black flyswatter.
I love how one is comforting the other  over her loss
That arm of support 💞
That is unbelievabley hilarious!!!
My St. Bernard (Sherlock) always gets his toys stuck under the couch and he just cries while staring at the couch until I get it out. He also likes to stick his big fat face next to mine when I’m trying to look under the couch for it.
BELIEVE BUDDY!! He’s got this
You can take that lower drawer out relatively easily. Just lift it off the track.
My mom cleans the area behind the stove every three months. (She cans anything preservable and it gets everywhere, so the deep cleans coincide with canning) We're talking shutting off the gas, pulling the stove out, scrubbing walls and stove, etc. The amount of cat toys she finds....
Did anyone else think this was a GIF and watched this for a while expecting to see the toy?
"Buddy, it's coming. Look! It's almost here!!!!"
Just remove the drawer it’s a lot easier
I love how the one on the left is like "it's going to be okay dude!"
Brown/Orange cat: Don't worry, buddy. You'll get it back.
After my dog passed away a couple months ago I gave her tennis ball over to the cat. Problem solved or pretty much so anyway. Actually never had considered giving a tennis ball to any of my cats. Been digging kitty toys from under all manner of furniture for years and hasn’t thought of a tennis ball before but I guess they like those too.
Get a 2x4 and cut it so it can be right behind the front legs of the oven. Put it two screws at the top of the 2x4 and then use rubber bands or string and wrap around the oven legs and screw. Do not do this if that bottom drawer is a broiler.
Well I'm invested now too, what's under the stove?
Pull out the drawer to see underneath.
You know stoves pull out.
I would buy this painting
Those are some gorgeous cats!
I bet it’s half-baked.
I like how the one on the left looks like he's comforting the other one like " don't worry man she's gonna get it"
The calico cat is saying to his pal, "Hey buddy, you think we'll get it back soon? You see it?"
great picture!
i love how the left cat consoling the right cat like saying : "everythings gonna be okay"
I like the 'There, there, dear' paw of support.
this is literally my cat
I like seeing how that one cat comforting the other one like saying "its not your fault the toy get under there"
maine coons? they’re always full of personality like this
My dog does this, but he also jumps on your head while your trying to get it out
I remember when my cat Misty would wait for me to open my door so she could attack my oldest stuffed animal Joe-Bear, or was it Moe-Bear? Either way she attacked them and I had to forcibly lift her and move her, their still alive to this day, can’t say the same about that creepy ass her movie stuffy
This brings back many happy memories of my then kitten waiting as I pulled his toys out from under the stove.

I’m convinced he thought of it as a vending machine: insert toy mouse, get hot roasted chicken from the magical food box.
Soooo familiar. Your stove, our fridge...
Yeah, but a cat's facial expression is always, 

"Why do those Evil stoves and refrigerators keep stealing my toys, Mommy...?"
I've been staring at this for literally 2 minutes until I noticed that it's not actually a gif. I hate myself
Just pull the bottom drawer out. They’re all removable.
This was our cat when I was married. She loved to "lose" her toys under the oven and fridge.
Wow those coats look so soft & fluffy! 😻😻
Oh boy can I relate 🤣
It same as my dog when he's playing with his ball then it goes to under the refrigerator and he looks at me like saying " can you get it for me 🐶🥺".
If only the rest of Reddit were like R/aww instead of arguing with everyone that your opinion is best... I love this subreddit.
Sooooo been there! 😂
I can relate.
Oh this is gonna be my next meme template.
I just did this with my mom's cats.
It's okay bruh, I got your back!
/u/Shitty_Watercolour /u/OkGraphicDesigner need to get here stat
I would eat it
Someone tell the kid about the warming tray lol
My cats do this. And im pretty sure the longer I take to get it out the more they don't want to play with it when I finally do.  But, if I'm too fast with my retrieval, it almost immediately ends up back under the fridge and the impatient meowines start. I think the game is to watch me get it, and if I take too long they get bored of it.
Hahahaha! I totally GET this! Chopsticks are really useful too!
That is the CLEANEST grout I've ever seen.
After saving countless toys from under the oven and refrigerator, I went to the hardware store and bought a wedge of foam to fill in the gaps. Now she’s found other places to lose her toys.
Easier to remove the entire drawer and let them retrieve it. Lol
This is why I buy my cat's favorite toys in multiples. She especially loves little brightly colored springs and I have a dozen of them. When I realize I haven't seen her play with one for a while I toss another one out. Once they're gone I sweep under the furniture to get all the lost ones and the cycle continues.
Awwweee
That’s a familiar scene in this house 🤣
Haha. Tbis is a daily occurrence for my stove. Over under is 4 toys
This happens with my dog, but L O U D L Y
If you walk out to the kitchen in the middle of the night and see both of your cats doing this you have a mouse in the house.
Awwweee.



Precious!!
We recently replaced our stove.  There were about 30 toy mice under there XD
I thought those were hairs on my screen.....
I swear I saw them wiggle a little...
In the good old days this would be poking in hopes that the rat would come out so the cats can eat it. 

Not finding a toy.
I have been there 100%!!! All cats gathered 'round and anxiously waiting toys to be throw out!
Seriously, my cat loves to shove his crinkle balls under the stove and the couches. I bought big ones but he doesn’t like them because the won’t fit. 🤦🏼‍♀️
You know most of those drawers come totally out, right? Unless it’s a warming drawer, but (and I’m sad to admit it) this one isn’t.
My dog does this when I have to retrieve toys from under the couch. It really sucks when she steps on me while I’m down like that. She is heavy!
"It's okay, Paul. Human will get fuzzy ball with tiny bell and you can continue your strung out catnip trip."
Other cat is like, "it'll be ok, you're almost gonna get it"
We got this buddy.
Why did they send a kid, a young kid based on those fingers, to do the retrieval?
Those breed of cats are extremely fluffy.
How adorable
I feel like this photo has left us hanging.
This is our house every morning. . . a certain object HAS to be found!
You'll be fine. It's a great game.
This should be posted in accidental renaissance
Stop it this is so cute.
Cuteeee
All three have similar hair
My puppy does the same thing except she tries to rip my hair out while I’m doing it!
So spot on!!!
You know that drawer comes out, right?
You can pull the appliance away from the counter
Cats are using their toy retrieval tool........human 😂.
Cute
Springs?
Pretty sure the bottom drawer comes out.
Don't worry buddy he's gonna get it
This is me all day my Cat loves rope mice.
My younger cat will stand in front of my face while I do that. Loki is not transparent, despite his vehement belief.
You can remove that bottom drawer from the over and get the toys super easy. It comes out like any roller drawer, unless they made it “better”.
Omg lol!!!
"Please come back toy, I need something to chew and claw on." - Cat
Adorable!

After using an untwisted wire coat hanger for a while, I bought a flexible grabber with a light on the end to retrieve toys from under the oven and other tight spots. My girl Lola lays down with me to make sure I'm doing it right.
If I had a dollar for every time I had to fish a toy out from under the refrigerator, my wealth would rival Jeff Bezos’s.
The drawer comes out.
I had a stove similar to that one, and my cat would also get his toy stuck under there ALL THE TIME. So I would always have to try to fish it out the same way, with a broomstick or whatever else I could find.

One day I realized I could actually pull that bottom drawer all the way out and retrieve the toy much more easily. You should check if you can do the same with yours!!
It gets intense ya know! 😂
The word is EAGER. God damn it! 

From Merriam-Webster:

“EAGER, AVID, KEEN, ANXIOUS, ATHIRST mean moved by a strong and urgent desire or interest. EAGER implies ardor and enthusiasm and sometimes impatience at delay or restraint. ANXIOUS emphasizes fear of frustration or failure or disappointment.”
Every. Single. Day.

(life with cat)
this is a fantastic fucking picture
Do the bottoms not fully pull out on all stoves? Mine does is why I'm asking. Pull and lift. I have to get toys daily from under there lol.
LOLOLOL
I got a huge kick out of this. Thank you.
So adorable 😊
i love how one cat has his "arm" around the other cat as if for emotional support
Omg I love how brown cat has his paw around silver cat 😹
Cuuuute
💎🙌❤Hold on kitty's❤🙌💎
This has a Rockwell painting vibe lol
Love the comforting paw
Totally awesome pic. Somebody stylize this and make it look outdoorsy and fanatical!
Plot twist: There is actually a mouse under there that runs out into your face
Stewart little is hardly a toy OP!!!!
That cat with a pat on the back thou
The arm over the shoulder though
Soon friend... soon.

Ultimate buddy pose: an arm across your friend's shoulder! I love this so much!
It's OK bro... mom's going to get it for us... don't worry!!!
Jerry?
Awe so sweet
I wish my cats were like this 😩
Omg his little kitty arm is on the other ones back.
The suspense is killing me lol
Huh your kitchen is a lot like ours (before it waa renovated)... Are you in Ontario?
I hate that game
Go through this at least once a week.
Android photos so bad
Pull out the drawer in the future to get them out quickly
Took me way too long to realize this wasn’t a gif and nothing was gonna happen
My ex and I had to keep a towel stuffed under the stove for this exact reason. Sooooo many toys had to be fished out from underneath!
My cat does this constantly and then walks around yelling that he lost his ball. His favorite spots to lose it are behind the fridge, under the oven and under the couch but its a huge hassle getting it out so we finally got a Finglonger. Now it's only slightly less of a hassle.
Awww 🥰
what are they looking for?
\*\* This will be back under the stove absolutely immediately \*\*
This is so cute
This needs to be made into a Norman Rockwell painting
I want to use this as a meme template
I like how the calico is trying to hold his buddy back so he can get it first.
So cute
the cats are waiting too foreverrrr bestfs
Remove the drawer. It’s easier. I know, have dog.
Goonies never say die
I’m 27 and I wait like this for my cookies to come out the oven
Just pull the drawer out and everything under the stove is accessible... But I’m happy they’re having a good time!
I swear, some animals act too human, and I love it
What happened next?  I'm invested in this now.  Did they get the toy back?  How was the toy retrieved?  Was the stove moved?  Was a tool used?  What tool?What does the toy look like?  I need more!!!!
I’ve looked through the comments and I definitely could have missed it but.... pull the drawer all the way out and off! 
My cats knock stuff under all the time and it’s so much easier to retrieve things that way!
That drawer should come out completely and reveal loads of dust, and many, many, cat "toys"
Thought this was a video, stared way too long waiting for the toy to come out.
I'm sure they are waiting
That paw is there to get the jump on ditching everyone if the plan goes south and nothing else..
I thought my cat was the only one that does that LOOOL
That gray cat looks like a less chonky version of my cat
So adorable.
Mine did that too! She also helped getting it out with her paw ❤️
Cats love when you hunt with them.
This reminds me of my dog who pushes his little tennis balls under the couch, on purpose and then wants us to get them whenever he wants attention.
r/AccidentalRenaissance
Annoying ? But good
Common occurrence in my house
“Bro! She’s gonna get it!”
As an appliance repair man I think this is funny because instead of having to struggle with the little stick, they could’ve just pulled the shelf out and grabbed it easily
Do you live in Utah?
I got tired of laying flat on the floor and fishing toys out from beneath the stove. After getting arthritis in my knees, it became too painful getting back up. Instead, I just remove the drawer and use the long grill tongs to pull them out. Takes a couple of minutes... drawer replacement included.
I get annoyed enough when my dog whines when he gets a ball stuck in the gap next to the fridge, I can't imagine having to macgyver toys from under the oven!
“It’s okay, mittens. The thunder flesh will get it.”
Wow!!!
5 seconds later: mooooom!!! It’s under the oven again!!!
my cats does it daily, he would push his favorite toy under my washer. His favorite toy is my wife's padding to cover her nipples. He also likes her Bra......  please cat, those used to be my toys.
I truly hope you frame this photo; one day it will be a source of pure joy and maybe some tears.
This seems all too familiar,  only with me it's the fridge
This picture is absolute gold, I love it.
Such excitement! It's good to have backup for such important tasks.
r/accidentalrenaissance
That’s not an arm of support. That’s an arm of restraint!
Buddies for life 😄
The one cat toy that got away.
My stupid self thought this was a video. Was sitting here in anticipation for several minutes
/r/accidentalrockwell
I blocked off the space under my oven with a piece of aluminum flat bar. The cat can push her toys under/behind something else. (Currently her favorite is the pantry door, with the space between the fridge and the cabinets being a close second.)
Rockwell painting material
I love how the one is trying to comfort his buddy. “It’ll be okay man, don’t worry. I gotcha.”
Здесь все говорят что-то на английском, но у меня только что был урок английского языка, поэтому мне лень это все переводить (я устала)
Просто оставлю кенгуру 🦘
Even though my arm is draped over you in a thinly veiled attempt to display solidarity with my brethren during this emotional toy retrieval, it's actually because I plan on holding you down when the toy comes out
I read it as “anxiously awaiting ravioli.”
My dumbass thought this was a video so while I was anxiously waiting for the retrieval of the toy for about 37 seconds, I clicked to see how much time was left. ... it just zoomed in. Swindled again.
In our house it will be a poor terrified rat or mouse. I know the cat brought it in, she knows I know she brought it in but she pretends she just discovered it under the stove.
His little arm on his back 🥺
Left to right cat: Calm down Jerry! It'll be fine! He'll be fine, just stay calm!
It’s alright bro, she’ll get.
Omg did nobody notice in this thread that you are able to take the bottom drawer out of the bottom to the oven easily?  This is true of all models but I have this exact GE one you barely even need to lift it that high to do so!
I was looking at this picture for 2 minutes thinking it was a video. 10/10 would do it again
Used to love that. The excitement of recovering jingle balls.
That reassuring paw on another fucking killed me 😍
XD finish him! 😂
Wait for me guys what are you looking for?
Aww haha cuteee! 🥰🥺☺️
Ha, ha......
I just keep buying more and more of them and when I decide to clean behind stuff I find tons of them.  They are gone again within a day.
🥰🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Nice
My dog does this. 🤣
Someone turn this into a renaissance painting asap.
It's okay mittens, our human slave will have us back to it in no time
That's what called curiosity, Indeed!!
Cuuuute!!
Gorgeous cats I love them!
haha working as a team . cute
I love the cat on the left offering comfort. "It's OK Fluffy, it'll be out in a minute"
I had to block off underneath my fridge because one of my boys recently got his paw caught on something under the fridge while trying to retrieve his toys and it was a traumatising experience for both of us :(
Oh that’s super cool
The calico is offering the grey cat support
This is my golden retriever everytime I’m trying to get his tennis ball from anywhere...
Love this!
Meanwhile, my uncle's cat would hit him trying to retrieve the toy and be pissed that he can't have the toy back, 'cause my uncle is bandaging his damn arm
That's like me and any dog ever after they throw their toy under a closer. Though dogs usually see it as a win anyway because they can lick my face when I'm trying to find it.
The paw on the back really makes this photo!
lmao! The cat consoling his buddy who lost the toy!!
Legend says they are still there
r/catmoralesupport
what if they get stuck inside it
Lol my dogs do this too me. My husky starts whining and barking and I say "show me where" and he takes me right to it! It's so cute...
This is me but with an ice cube lol
1OOK LETS DO THIS
r/accidentalrockwell
So my cat Oscar loses milk rings under the fridge. There was enough space under the fridge to put a wood stick from Home Depot. He noticed the stick and spent the day promptly removing it so he could continue hitting milk rings out of reach.
I had this happen so much I went to the hardware store,  purchased a door sweep, glued magnets to it and stuck it on so It just barely touched the floor.     Note magnets do not work on stainless or brushed aluminum.
❤️
What beautiful cats!! Mom is making them super happy right now♥️Even if nothing comes out, this part of the hunt sure is fun❣️😸❣️
The drawer should be able to come out. I find millions of toys all the time lol
This is so perfect haha
One time I cleared out under the fridge and my cat had FOURTEEN toys pushed under it!
Rookie.  take that bottom drawer out.
I *SO* wish this were a video.
Calico cat to gray cat:  "Ok dude you get it and I will be right here supporting you."
That silver cat is beautiful
And here I was musing about mice removal!! 😆😆
Hey! My stove!
Pull the drawer out. It makes retrieval a ton easier
I'm so anxious
What kind of toy is this?
Does it squeak?
Does it it cry?

Is it colorful? 
Or full of music? 
I, wonder and hope for it's future
Full of hope and adventure!
Its my cake day
Those look like Maine coons? Am I correct? I know because I have one.
