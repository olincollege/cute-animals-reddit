My cat always sneaks behind my dog, smacks him in the asshole 4 or 5 times and sprints off.  He’s a full grown lab, deathly afraid of an 8 pound cat to the point where he takes the longest route possible if my cat is in the way.

I wish they had this kind of love 
That smile is fucking adorable
“Cat is being nice.... don’t move”
Bro. That’s cute as fuck
It looks like the cat is telling him a secret
That grin.. jesus what a smile. 
The most wholesome video today hands down 
[deleted]
My cat does this to my dog, and my dog got addicted, so now she harasses my cat to lick her face and ears and my cat just wants to chill by the window and watch the birds.  It’s causing a lot of drama.
My dog and cat do this all the time. Definitely best friends
[deleted]
Fuckin hell my life is empty and alone 
I wish gifs like these were like 2 minutes. I really love when animals get along
*sees pitbull*

>sort by: *controversial*



You're going to look back on this adorable memory and regret that you made it a vertical video.
Now I want big cat smooch too
Awww that pup has beautiful eyes!
How about that Eagles/Cowboys game tho?! that was a good one!
This is cute but damn I hate the cowboys. 
Our dogs and neighbors cat do the same. They’re licking inside each other’s ears (disgusting) and enjoying it. 

My Malinois will grumble in appreciation as her ears are cleaned. It’s a little disturbing.  
Pitties shown love can be absolute sweethearts.
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Doggie dimples!
When someone hits that spot you can't reach
Holy shit this is the most adorable thing I’ve seen in my entire life.
I watched this for way too long, grinning harder than this beautiful dog. Sweet kitty. 💓
Why is every dog on reddit a pit bull.

Edit: Based on the replies I have concluded that the battle over the soul of the pit bull is a proxy for the general sense of injustice felt in America, and you should all have your own Giles Jaunes revolt instead.
My cat and my dog love each other this much too! It’s the best!

I've never seen something look so much like a smile on an animal. 
Holy fuck we definitely need more cats loving their dog bros fuck.

Fuck me in my arse that is wholesome as hell
That smile :)
This would be great on r/puppysmiles! 
My point on pitbulls! It's the human. Not the dog. That dog is full of love and gets love😍
HIS LITTLE SMILE
this is cute cat
This is so similar to my sisters house. Curvy stick decor, ikea furniture and cute pit bull. She doesn’t have a cat though.
Well fuck, that's beautiful. 
WTF is with all the pit bulls on r/aww lately?
I hate the Dallas Cowboys.
My fuckin *heart*
Stop fucking saying "fren". You sound like you're 5 years old. 
If that’s not sweeter then sugar in sweet tea. How adorable those two are.  
this is cute cat
My pit wants this from my cats so bad but he gets way too excited when they show him any type of love. Level 5 clinger for sure 
Look at that ferocious pitbull 🙄😘
God, pitties have the best smile.
Pit bulls are the best!
Pit bulls can be some of the purest creatures 
Melted my heart. He looks like he's smiling. Pits are the best dogs in my opinion. ❤
Kitty fren give him licks and makes him happy
I love this.

Pit bulls are so sweet
Absolute Unit
I just love the way pit bulls smile melts my heart 
The smile, the tail, and the eyes are all so cute!
My dog and cat does this... Except cat ends up with massive fur balls and dog has tangled up locks of hair. But it looks very cute when they groom each other.
So cute. 

I feel sad for my Frank. His “sister” died a couple years ago. She used to give him a bath daily, and he would reciprocate. 

We got a shelter pooch a few months after and Frank tried the bath thing with her. New gal is not having it. Her face looks shocked and horrified when he tries licking her. 
Okay for real, I'm planning on adopting an English Bulldog and a cat. Most likely gonna adopt the dog first and then look for a cat that's used to dogs already. Is there any way I can help encourage the two of them to be cool with each other? How should I introduce them? help 
VICIOUS PITBULL DECAPITATES CAT (GRAPHIC)

My heart just melted. What a sweet pair 😍😍😍
His smile.  The wag.   The love.  I can’t even take it.  This video is wholesome perfection. ❤️❤️
Love that smile!
Oh my god this is amazing
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all day! ❤️
Smooches from his fren make him happy on his other en
We used to have a staffy and a cat and she would spend ages just washing his face and ears and he would sit there with the same expression on his face.  I think she thought of him as a great, big oversized kitten 💕
Can't stop smiling along with him, this makes me happy
The smile got bigger at the end! 
Oh my gosh be still my heart! That smile!
My heart<3
This totally made my crap day better. So sweet and so damn cute!

Good cameraman
Go Cowboys!

My grandmother hates all pits because she got attacked by one. I love all of them no matter what. 
I love bullies, never met a bad one.
That made my day,   Thanks!!!

I'd be happy too after that lateral TD, after the game clock expired, and fuck the patriots.
My cat and dog take turns cleaning each other and have so much love for each other 
Best friends ever!
I have the same attention span as those animals when I watch the Cowboys play also
Just want to say, nice xbox.
OP, is this your bedroom? Are you sitting up in bed with a skull head doona/duvet?

Well this is damned adorable.
r/mademesmile 
That smile
sooooo cute
Sometimes you see the things you see at exactly the right time, thank you!
Is the cat a girl? Female cats have strong mothering instincts. I'll bet she sees the dog had her bigger kitten.
That smile.  I needed this today.  
My cat does the exact same thing to my dog, and he's also very happy when she does it.  
Hes smiling :)
Fuck the cowboys 
My heart! 
The face of pure guilty pleasure 
I LOVE PIT SMILES 
Don't we all need a bit of inter-species love? #itsnotbestialityifitslove ❤
That smile, soooo cute!
This is so sweet
My buddy. My buddy!

I wish my kitty kissed like this 
Smoochie poochie! 
Too cool! Awesome pair of friends! 
Look at that smile and tail wag, I love it!
#IN THE ARMS OF AN ANGEL 
My pup, who looks exactly like yours, is meeting her first kitten. So far they are at the, dog tail swatting phase. It's cute. 
I love his smile! 
How pittyful!!
That smile is melting my heart 
You can see he is freaking smiling. So cute! 
God bless them
U can see how good they are 
That smile. That damned smile...
Those are the most loving eyes I’ve ever seen. 
Fuck the eagles...fuckest the cowboys
That’s cute, but, How ‘bout them cowboys?!
That being said, there were some questionable calls by refs on both sides, but 2 against the Eagles stand out that were game changing. Fuck it, sometimes we get screwed and sometimes we get lucky.
This makes me so happy. I'm just grinning at my phone like an idiot. 
Him smiling makes my heart smile 
Forget the wagging tail, his smile is everything!
He's so happy.
hahahaha i love how he legitimately smiles
*friend 
Ehmehgerd
Look at that smile omg he's so happy 
OMG
Can anyone tell me why these particular videos won't play for me?
He’s even grinning 
That smile!!  😍😍
I didn't know this for a long time, but dogs ears are super sensitive not just to sound, but touch too. When they lick each other's ears, it's a huge sign of affection.
Just going to start each morning watching this so that I start my day in a happy place💓
Soooo adorable! That smile at the end is priceless
Cowboys fan?
Cowboys Eagles?
That's the most human smile I've ever seen on a dog
Meanwhile my cat and dog eye eachother down as they walk by eachother ready to fight the other one. Funny thing is all of my dogs are scared of my cat. My dogs are 5x the size of this tiny cat and they'll run from him any day.
Best part of this video is the Cowboys beating the Eagles.
so sweet
That's what I tell people, I have a pitty and a pitty kitty. They are best friends too!
That is soooo sweet. Love the smile! 
I know all pitties aren't vicious, but my son was bitten and it's hard to get rid of that image. But when I see that smile, it gets a little easier to believe that there are good ones out there.
I think shes getting an itch near or inside his ear. My dog will do this too when I rub her ear. She has allergies. Also a pitbull. 
His smile is priceless 
LOOK AT THAT BIG SWEETIE 😍
that is so pure
Is that a Maine Coon? 
:)
r/disneyeyes
The truth about  cats and dogs...they're awesome! 
Why the hell do you have my exact family room layout but with slightly different pets and furniture 
English is hard
Looks so happy!
What a happy boye
I always thought pitbulls are a lot more anthromorphic cuz of their really visible irises 
I used to have a dog who would cuddle my cat and lick his ears and they both looked like it was pure bliss. 
Then my ex girlfriend took the dog and made both of us sad :(
This is absolutely adorable!!
Contagious smile
GO HAWKS
Friends
Maine Coon?  I have a brown tabby that looks nearly identical. She is either super affectionate with my lab/pit mix, or sneak attacking him from behind!
Awww indeed.
This warmed my heart so much 
I love this
Him sooo happy! Look at his smile! 
This is pretty darned sweet. 
This is what my doggo and his best friend one of our kittehs is like. Plus our cockatiel also thinks he is best friends with same doggo. ^_^ 
😍
He looks so contented. 
The smile!!!!!
Y
This makes me happy.
Best part about this is you can actually see his lips widening into a smile, eyes getting sparkly and tail unable to stop wagging. 
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
That is the cutest thing I have seen in a long time
Awwww, you can see him smile 💗
Oh my heart.
***\*gaaaaaasp\* look at the dogs eyes!!!!!!!***
A pittie and a kitty. Made my day.🙂
The little grin is so cute xD.  But he looks pit.  So I guess that means he's a killing machine :/
Pets should command the earth. Not humans. 
Ooof my heart
This should be on r/dogsmirin!

Look at that smile :3
This is by far the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen. 
So sweet
Good pitbull 
Glad he has his whole tail, thank you. I can't tell you how sad I feel when I see docked tails or ears😔 I hope when I get my puppy, my cats are friends.
This is so FUCKING cute I can’t handle it 
ohhh no. cowboys fan

Awwwwww how adorable
This is the best gif I've ever seen on this sub.

Oh may lawd he comin
Wish I could be this happy
Find you a woman that looks you in the eyes like my pit looks when my cat is lickin’ its head

-man cutting apple with knife 
The cat isn’t licking the dog
This is called dominance grooming. For some reason cats behave opposite of most mammals, and grooming others means you are superior.
The dog has ear mites.
he/she still has a tail. thank you for not mutilating your family member.
The dog actually smiles! 
Thanks, I’m crying. 
Such a golden boye
Too adorable 
Awwwww!! Warms my heart!!  Love it!
i know animals cant smile but I swear this dog smiled
Oh my godddd oh my godddddd 😭
Seconds later a toddler walks by... 
Shouldn’t this be upvoted more?
The view of the tail wagging wasn't even necessary to know he was happy, he actually started smiling.. the more the cat licked, the bigger he smiled
We need one of those poems in here
Cat technician.
I ship.
I dont even like dogs but this shit is cute as fuck.
Ohh that smile 😍
Go Cowboys!!!
I love this.  He just looks so extremely happy to the point that it looks like he is smiling.  
This is so pure and sweet.
Such a relaxing cuddle.
That dogs face is hilarious in a cute way
Apparently supposedly a cat feels dominant when grooming others, whilst most others feel okay about being groomed. This works out well.
My kingdom for this.
That smile tho
Pure bliss
Wookidat smile n waggy tail! He looks SO happy!
The kitty has successfully hacked into doggos Mainframe 
This is why you get on the Internet. 
Ow. My heart.
Best Couple of the year :-)
That dog has reached a zen state. 
This is the cutest god damn thing I've ever seen.
Something I always found funny about cat/dog interactions is cats will lick someone to display dominance, whereas a dog will lick someone to display submission. So in this picture both are assuming their dominance is unquestioned since the other is happy about it.
The fucking smile!!!!
Nothing has made me aww’d harder
That smile though, so cute.
This was to my liking 
Is this one of those scary pit bulls I hear so much about?
Omg I cannot take the cuteness.
I never knew dogs actually smiled until i discovered this sub
#Thanos!!!
I have never seen this breed of dog without his tail cut off. So glad OP did not :)
That is lovely, you can see his mouth move as his smile gets bigger ❤️
That cowboys game tho 
He's smiling!

My cat bops my dog on the head rapidly....it sounds hollow :(

He needed solace because his favored football team sucked so bad.

"Humongously huge vicious PITbull moments before he probably attacks and kills defenseless house cat."

Look at this pup, hes havin a blast!
There was no need to zoom in on the tail, HE LITERALLY SMILED nsjssn
The cat is whispering a secret to him.

That smile. He might be plotting against the cat... 
Looks like my cat lol
That smile! :D
He actually looks like he is smiling there.
Look at that doggie smile. How sweet are the two of them together!
That’s such a weirdly human smile
He’s actually smiling tho aw
If you lick your dog's head he will be equally happy.
He’s smiling! 
He reminds me of Yoda for some reason.
His gaunt ass smile got me killed
Whats the name of this lovely breed?
Why am I crying? Jesus, this is too cute
Hi fren
Good doggo! Good kitty! 
That’s the sweetest thing ever❤️🐾
For cats, grooming/licking someone is a way of showing dominance. 
My heart can't handle this

Those aren't smooches.  That is a full on bath he is getting.
Hello, I also have a cat and a dog. How does one do this? 
Are dog "smiles" actually smiles? Are they a result of co-evolution with humans?
Oh my gosh that's so cute this is so nice thank you so much I needed this
That smile! 😍
That would be me if I had a gf 
Look at his smile! 😍

Oh that smile! 🥰😭
The Cowboys whoopin' on them Eagles makes him happy.
Wish I felt that level of happiness watching that game... 😭
LPT: put Cheeto dust on your dogs head. Let cat lick. Reap ungodly sums of karma.
If only there was a way to use the camera to record the whole length of the dog without having to move around... Now that would be something. 
Look at that wee smiling face,so cute 
Thanks, that's cool stuff
I love staffies. So affectionate. My drum teacher used to have one and she would wiggle in under the seat while I was playing so she could rest her head on my knee. And then she'd fart.
Woah, a pit bull post that hasn’t been locked yet. Rarity. 
I love how you can actually see the dog smile!
A pits smile warms my heart everytime 
Pitties are the biggest babies.
This is truly one happy doggo :)
That's the sweetest thing! Look at the pittie smile. Big baby doll.
I had a pitbull. Had to put her down last October. They are the most affectionate dogs.
I hate so much that they get a bad reputation due to irresponsible owners.
Everything about this vid. Even the camera work.
This doggo is legit smiling!!!
Every pit bull I’ve ever met is the snuggliest, happiest little loser I’ve ever met. Look at that dorky smile. 
He looks so appreciative of his frens lovies. I love them both. 
My heart is bursting 
Aaaaaw

This is fake propaganda. Wake up sheeple. Pit bulls are killing machines and seconds after this clip that cat got eaten.
My pit mix will actually "tell" my other dog to lick her. It's weird.
That pitbull looks sooooo dangerous. /s
Pits have such great smiles <3
I need to show this to my dog, he spent 30 minutes stressing about 2 strays walking the property today
Just when I think I've seen the cutest thing on the internet... Adorable!

For you people that claim dogs can’t smile. Explain this.
What a fucking cutie.
I'm not crying, you are 
Ooh boy, in here before the anti-pitt police come in and cause the thread to be locked by mods.

Behold: the terrifying pit bull. Isnt it a monster? Look at the rage in those soft, adorable eyes. See the bloodlust in his sweet happy smile. Coil in horror at his tail wagging in excitement from getting kisses from his fren.
is this OC? Do you have a source?

Hello OP, would you be ok with it if my comment here gets up voted lots which would be me 'using' your post please? 
I recently lost huge amounts of karma for a dumb comment I Wrote. It was dumb because reddit seemed to be having a day and took it very wrong.
Anyways, would be nice if you give the ok on it✌️quite sure I would do the same (not to guilt trip you. Btw your dog and cat are so fucking cute. That dog, omfg would I like to gently squeeze/play with his fat head/face/neck.
Peace! 
Im more interested in what game youre watching.
Why this dog look like Thanos? 🧐
From what I know about cats, that licking is just a precursor to a vigorous and violent surprise sneak bite attack.

To be followed by disembowling kicky kicks.
Vicious pit mix being vicious. 
Pitbulls are bad.
I hate pit bulls, but I love this.

Yes, I’m breedist. But my dog was attacked by one, I have seen too many stories of people being sporadically attacked by one, and it is the ping-pong ball against a bowling ball effect. If a lab bites you, it’ll suck, but you will be OK. If a pitbull bites you, you are fucked.

But every once in a while, you see an adorable pitbull video that reminds you- it’s rare, but there are just a few out there that are good fucking souls. 
Yo hol the heck up...

#IS THAT MY BOYS?!
I'm pretty sure the cat is licking its paw not the dog.
The fact this shit got 80,000 upvotes makes me wish the Earth destroying asteroid would hurry the fuck up. 
When you think of why this is happening it’s even cuter. It is often that if your cat really loves you and wants to protect you (not humans unless it’s a baby because they see you as their parent) they will groom your hair. But the dog! Dogs normally won’t stand still for that or they will lick back if they are being licked by something, UNLESS it is by a motherly figure to where it will take it as a grooming section with love. So what this is saying is that the cat wants to protect this dog because they love them, and the dog sees that cat as their mom and feels extremely happy and safe
Cant say it enough FUCK PITBULLS. Whats up with the propaganda on this sub lately?
 I was searching for a fitting post. This one is so damn cute.
