Productivity would decrease but morale would soar!
Best office ever!
We used to have a Beagle in the office. She used to steal everyone's food out of the garbage, out of the kitchen, out of people's bags... just an absolute terror when it came to food. She learned that after-lunch she would get a greenie treat and would howl if we forgot. She would also choose who she wanted to walk her. Office dogs are the best.
You never know when you need a good paper shredder
Dogs are the best they always put a smile on my face

How do I go about requisitioning a Desk-Dog?
I‚Äôm not sure the folks over at r/MechanicalKeyboards would approve of that quiet Microsoft monstrosity you‚Äôre typing on. What are you trying to do, respect your neighbors with a quiet keyboard a happy Golden?
I'd be so much more a fan of dogs if they didn't smell so awful to me.

I think it's a bit like the  way some people can't stand cilantro. Most people seem to either like the way dogs smell or to be indifferent to it. But for the unfortunates like me a dog fresh out of a bath smells bad. I wonder if it's a genetic thing or not.
Golden Retrievers are literally the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
Awesome... my office only has mice, cockroaches and spiders.
So was this pre-installed or did you have to bring your own?
I had one in my office for years,  best co-worker ever.  I miss her so much.
I would honestly be 1000000xs more motivated to go to work haha
The new paper shredder has been installed
Oh my gooddd I need an office dog so bad right now!!

Where do I order one of these? Do they come trained?
I agree we should get a snack during work
Boss: Wheres the report?

Me: Doggo ate it

Boss: You too!
I wanna see what happens if you try to pet it over the table ;p
That was the softest and most relaxing ‚Äúhello‚Äù I‚Äôve ever heard.

Did that come standard with the desk?

Such a beautiful face.

All that warm breath on your leg could be very distracting
I just got a new job offer, I'm seriously considering negotiating this into my contract ü§î
It just occurred to me that work would be infinitely more fun and less depressing with one of these under my desk.
Two Calculators. Fancy.
My former bosses brought their dogs to the office almost every day so my office did indeed come with them
We have 3 office dogs and it's awful. Non of them are trained. One is becoming more aggressive every month. One is extremely high energy and doesn't get the attention he needs. They jump on you, bark and whine, steal your food, chew on everything, and stick their nose in your crotch. 

I'm sure your doggie is very well behaved and is wonderful to have at the office. But it's not always a good thing.
That blank, dumb stare. Not a goddamn thing going on in that head. It's so wonderful.
I have that same calculator at work. Is that not the absolute BEST calculator you've ever used?
That's awesome. But I hope your realise you have two of them. But I don't see the point of calculators in the world of computers. 

But a concept of a roof over your head and woof under your table, I love!
What about schools ??
üòçüòçüòçüòç
I fully agree. It's hard to get any work done without any sort of computer & office supplies!
Petition to make this possible :)
Wow that would make my day sooo much better.
Gotta make sure the cat doesn‚Äôt make off with the mouse.
I like how you keep your back up calculator nice and close to your first string calculator. Just in case
Would sign this immediately üòä
Bring a dog to work....
A desk with a trap (labra)dor
I don't know why but I just smiled amone in my bed
_reads title_. It better be a cute animal!

_watches video_ Delivered! \o/
That's the same keyboard I have! I really wish I could find another one. Mine is looking a little sad. The stands underneath the board broke, I've worn off the rubber coating on the wrist rest, and there was a soda incident that made some of the keys sticky.
Is that pupper 3000 standard issue?
Snack
Uhhhh you gonna pet me?
I miss my dog.
I have the same sharp calculator
Productivity +100
As someone who works in a dog friendly office, its alright for a little while until they start crapping under your desk, barking uncontrollably and chew wires. I love them, it just isn't cool to have 10+ dogs running around because not all dogs are pleasant.
This office addition would make Mondays much more bearable.
Thats a dope highlighter right there.
I take my dog to work with me every day.
Best motivation ever to keep a clean desk. :)
Those pretty brown eyes ü•∞ü•∞
Well that‚Äôs a spot where I never considered having to clean nose prints.

Ah, I see you got the Pet Support package.
I like how he was perfectly happy just to be there. 

Moving the clutter aside wasn't necessary except for this post.
Yes. And a kitty, too.
I worked at a call center which was really not for me but I have no doubt I'd still work there if I had this there
Imagine how much more productive people would be if you couldn't pet the pupper under your desk until you met the quota for the day.
Aww, yes!
An extra calculator?
I'll never complain. Ever. Just give me that doggo üòç

Two calculators **and** a computer? Yah, you're definitely faking work!
I clicked on this on the front page without realizing where it was from and it was such a lovely surprise.
If I ever felt sad or mad about working I would just look over and know who I‚Äôm getting food for
Yes ! I want one !
So you work on a PC with a keyboard with a keypad, but you have not 1 but 2 calculators next to the keypad?  Lolwut?
I thought it was the two calcs‚Ä¶
I wholeheartedly agree
With a dog in the office and chairs with wheels on them you do have to be extra careful a paw doesn't get caught by the wheels.
I wish my work let me bring my doggo in! Maybe someday...I feel like we‚Äôre pretty close to implementing that policy.
Look at that dog. Watching you do all the work. Bringing absolutely nothing to the table (except a cute ass face). A good lazy boy, truly.
they shpuld put a treat on the desk so the bottom gets completly covered in slobber.

then the maid will get stuck under the desk cleaning it off, and youll have to bang her to get her unstuck
I audibly gasped

Those calculators are something else.
i always miss them when they come around during day shift at my job at the hospital. sucks! they should start bringing them by for us night shift workers/patients as well!
Your calculator must be older than me lol
My workplace always have 2 corgis visiting cause my bosses daughter always brings them with her. And every time they visit I just pause my work and play with them
What is that?
Oh, A Golden opportunity.

With the exception of doing coke on them, glass desks suck.  They are a pain to keep clean and you can't use a mouse.  

cute dog though.  can you make a video doing lines on it's face please?
desk doggo
How did he for
I spend most of my time convincing my two dogs they don't need to wrestle under my feet while I'm on the phone with people when I work from home.
Desk Dogs‚Ñ¢ are great for morale, but terrible for productivity.
**two calculators?!!**
I was watching this video with a stupid, slack jawed bored expression and as soon as I saw the dog I involuntarily got a huge grin. Thank you.

I once asked HR if I could take my dog to work for take-your-kid-to-work day.  Answer was no....
Hello hooman, it is your 20 minute time for snacks alarm
Adorable.
If I could work in an office with a resident puppet I'd be in heaven!  Life without a doggo is almost not worth living, imho.
I would get all of my homework done if the reward was to pet fluffy doggo
Where's the mouse???
A good boy for every good employee.
Mine has 3 of them!  Love coming into the office in the morning to be greeted by them!
I disagree. I am allergic to dogs, and would suffer if one was around.

The way he's panting I think the place might be a little warm for him.

The title was appropriately misleading.  That keyboard?  The calculator?  Post-its?--ohhhh AWWWW.  You got me, OP.
I, too, used to have that desk. And a similar dog. Seems like a good boy!
Luckily mine has three! Toby the Cockapoo, Lolly the Pug and Barkamedies the Corgi

Love the dog. Now why do you need a calculator when u have a computer?
I was not expecting that, but aww
We have two doggos that are regulars and 2-3 more that come once awhile. It's amazing to have a dog around, makes the days feel a lot less depressing, especially being stuck in darkness all day in the winter.
Come down here and you'll float too.
Two calculators?! The insanity!

I mean as much as I love it, I do feel kinda' bad for the pupper having to be in a confined space like that.
I have one! My kitty likes to sleep in between the monitors. When she stretches, she grabs hold of some keys with her paws. Really fun when in trying to write emails.
Gosh you can just FEEL the hot breff.
A couple of times my dog was allowed to lay down under the desk in the office space of the vet. It's because he cried when he was left in the kennel after his checkup before I came back to pick him up.
Would make me happier, but less productive.
Awesome. My office has a chick that can't handle strong smells so we're not allowed Cologne and have been asked to use scent free body wash
Two calculators? I don't think I need to crunch numbers that hard...
Why is a calculator in r/aww?...... Awwww
