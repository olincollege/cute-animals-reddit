[Quick sketch for you. Feel better soon, Mr. Cat](https://i.redd.it/oh8u0ydqi0081.jpg)
It’s hard to watch this cat live out my dreams.
You do realize you know are a proud owner of a Cat Spa, this should be a business model.

Cat and Dog spas.
This is the best thing I have ever seen.
I think he's gone catatonic.
r/Blep
That’s is just too much. Perfect!
NO WAY....even the tongue!
Bleptacular.
If relaxation was a god, that cat would be it's worldly avatar
Can't believe after decades of internet cat videos I'm still seeing something new. Cute AF, hope your kitty feels better soon

Edit: of course my most upvoted comment is on a cute cat video lol
TIL cats get colds. Thanks for sharing :)

Edit: people in my life joke that I know more about cats than anyone they know. Thanks reddit for putting me in my place lol. In all seriousness, thanks for sharing your knowledge and it warms my heart how much you love your babes
Is that music Sigur Ros? Sounds like them.
I'd be checking their breathing lol

That is a megablep
My 7yo dorkus does this, but with my hand. He jams his face into my hand to cover his eyes, make a goofy face and then falls asleep.
My kitty crossed the bridge last night. Wanted to Cry seeing this. Give Your kitty a big great hug for those who Can't.
😢
Is he also wrapped up in a blanket? 😂😂😂😂 So cute
Is he purring? I can't imagine either of my cats tolerating this lol
Cat is in the avatar state. Don't disturb him 😁
Awwww poor kitty
Living my best life
Makes total sense that he enjoys it. Cats love warmth even when they are healthy and I bet when they are ill they crave warmth even more.
Check for breathing
A can that can relax in it's owners arms while laying on it's back is the purest sign of trust and love.
Today I learned cats can catch colds. Can dogs? I’ve had mine for 13 years now and I don’t think he’s ever had a cold
"Awww yisssss"
Can someone please go to OP’s house and make sure their cat is alive
r/businessidea
omg...he is relaxed with a capital R. Feel better lil guy.
Ss-s-should I try this on my cats even if they don't have a cold? 😍
Cute,but it must suxk for him.i think he's sticking his tounge out to breathe better
I'm guessing poor baby can't breath through his nose.  We had a very sick kitty a few years ago.  She had cancer and we were doing everything we could.  She got an upper respiratory infection during all of that, and the inability to breath through her nose (and lack of taste that comes with that) made her already frail body worse because she didn't want to eat.  Faced with very few options... I put afrin - yes, nosespray - on a q-tip and squished it up against each nostril.  They popped... and she started eating again.  I'm sure it wasn't the best medically to use on her but my options were a $2 bottle of nosespray or a $5000 nasal passage treatment and I thought maybe she just needed to pop those nostrils open to feel some relief, and it worked.
Aww, I hope he feels better soon. Poor thing. 💕
Rofl is your cat okay?
Based on the lack of motion, I think your cat is dead. I've never known a cat that chill.
This is what I go to the internet for. Thank you.
There is no way in hell my cat would let me put anything on her or wrap her in a blanket. Getting her into a kennel to go to the vet is a trying experience, I'm jealous.
u/savevidebot
Screw marriage, I'll wear cat ears and a tail if you're willing to treat me like this as your newest pet cat.
damn, was kind of disappointed when i unmuted it and didn't hear purring noises.
I'd mess this up by cuddling the comfiest cat of all time
Bro that tongue is so cuteeeee !!!! get well soon bb😙
You sure he isn't dead?
Poor baby ♥️♥️♥️ sending many healthy vibes your way
First off, I'm sending well wishes to this sweet sick baby.

Second, this is giving me the warm fuzzies to see a owner who loves their fur baby so much.
r/PetAfterVet
This should be shared with r/Eyebleach
Man, I don't even like cats much, but this is so sweet.
Aww!
You're a good pet owner. Keep it up!
Aww bless his heart he knows you are trying to help him. I hope he feels better soon. 🥰
Mofo looks dead
NGL this looks cozy
Looks like you’re taking very good care of your baby.  I hope he feels better soon.
wook at his widdle tongue!
You need to do this again, but with his nails getting done at the same time. I would fall off my chair.
Beautiful purrito
whats the music for this?? it sounds nice
I love how his tongue is just sticking out like that ITS SO CUTE
Why, for the love of the ever living God, do you people put shitty music on max volume for these videos!!??
aww that's called Living it up!
I think he’s ready for a Viking funeral
Oh my goodness that poor baby. Looks like he's in good hands ❤
why do I wanna slowly pull on his tongue ..
I want to go there
Oh my, this has made my day
How??? I can't even get mine to sit with a sheet on it.
Also - "awwww"
Real talk. What's up with this spam bot?

Also, I'm loving every second of this video.
This cat looks like he's ascending to Valhalla.
_lifts cucumber slices from his eyes_ "What is it meow?"
dawwwww
Wish I could be a tenth that relaxed sometimes.
I'm jealous. Looks like the kitty has passed out with bliss.
This is the life I want to have.
Okay but serious question, how do you know if a cat has a cold?
Had some kittens have run in with this.

Had to force feed them antibiotics everyday and put eye drops in their eyes the consistency of Vaseline.

Took forever to go away, 0/10 do not recommend.
Pets have “the life”.
If we did that to any of our dogs they'd freak out and think it's bath time
Damn he looks just like my dad
Awe your cat is so blessed to have your love and support!! Do you mind sharing how you knew he was sick? Obvious symptoms? I've got a Leukemia Positive cat who has been blessed thus far with only having one eye infection. But I am definitely a helicopter mama so I'm always on the lookout for potential health issues. Your guidance will likely stress me out, but I'd rather be overly cautious than regretful!
This is ltierally the happiest any cat has ever been. This is Peak Cat Nirvana.
r/savevideo
Thats the definition of relaxation lol. In the future, the next edition of The Oxford Dictionary will have a picture of this cat under the definition of relax.
I've looked at this for five hours now
I would be totally unable to resist putting my finger on his tongue.
What’s the name of the song? And by who?
Your life as you know it is now over. Your cat is obviously addicted to spa treatments now and you will be expected to provide them daily FOREVER. Or else.
Just seeing this cat makes me feel all cozy inside.
You reminded him of his past lives in Egypt. Now he’s going to expect this all the time lol
Hahaha that tongue. Now he's had it he'll want you to do it more often. Kitty spa.
I think my cats would do 2 things:  
1. Our boy would try to end my existence 
2. Our girl, who recently won the nickname of noodle, would find a way to just flop out of the towels
My cat gets chronic respiratory infections - the vet says her nasal cavity is underdeveloped; missing & collapsed cartilage. We frequently put her in a carrying crate, put a bowl of boiled water beside it, and cover the whole thing with a towel so she breathes in the steam (10 mins at a time). 

Might help your kitty too! And I’m definitely going to try the hot compress, hadn’t thought of that before!
so tired so shitty music on all videos.
I’m worried your cat isn’t as alive as maybe some other cats.
Get well kitty :)
Is that how cats recharge their nine lives!?
The zoom out was *chef’s kiss*
Could you buy like big googly eyes and put them on top of the towel?
Aw! That’s awesome!
Poor bby, wish him/her a speedy recovery!!
So darned cute 😂🥰
Little boy breathing through his mouth because he has a cold, and his nose is all stuffy.
You think…….
 he’s enjoying a warm compress…. 


I think…

Your cat is 500% broken.   

Give em a hug from me!
What a cute one😻😻🥰
That probably feels real nice on his little eyes. You're a good owner!
This is the best thing ever, 10/10 want a spa cat
Sending good vibes for your kitty- they can get really sick with these colds 😿. Give them lots of cuddles and the finest of Fancy Feast!
I hope he feels better soon. So cute! 🌹❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
He's iz goodest happy boi😃
u/greenstripedcat
Did he get some antibiotics? Poor baby. Should be feeling a ton better in a couple days
Oh to be a cat with a cold lol
I'm so scared that your kitty has covid or something. Is that even possible? Idk, I just want him to be okay. He looks like he's chillin though but I'm afraid to think it's cute
What is everything you have to have music in it
Love your pets when you first meet them love them all day because the memories last forever
Speaking as someone who used to wrap 3 blankets around a cat carrier so the feral cat who sheltered inside would stay warm during the winter (she has since moved indoors, where she sleeps in a full size bed, surrounded by cozy afghans), I feel qualified to say you are even better with a cat than I am...I love it!  Kitty does seem to love spa time.
Sure he still alive?
This cat is living a better life than I am.
TIL cats can catch a cold
Cold or no cold, I'd enjoy it too if I had someone to cradle me and put a warm compress on my eyes.

Seriously, this cat has reached new heights of ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug)**adorableness**![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug).
This successfully made my wife pee her pants from laughing so hard.
That is just the cutest thing!!  How did you get your cat to sit still?  Mine would never!
🟫🟫 
  
  👅
So how is the wee kitty now?
I think your cat just became a legend
poor buddy! feel better pal ❤️
I’m dying why is this so funny! The little tongue 😭😭
Feel better little buddy...
So cute
Please tell me you are also playing the music too, not just for the video.
is he for sure alive?
Derpy  blep! I love it!

Solid blep!
This fella is living his best life **meow**.
This may be the cutest thing I have ever seen.
Haha he looks like a gnome!!
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!!!!!
Oh man I want to give his tongue a little tug.
Cute
This is amazing!!
u/Ok-Supermarket-9961
Nice
i wonder if my cat would enjoy a spaghetti day even without having a cold
I've never heard of such a thing!!!!
Get well soon!
That is so precious! When our cats got sick, we were recommended to keep them in the bathroom with us when we showered, to let them get some steam. Maybe a combination of both would be best for your baby.

I hope he feels better soon! 💖
This is the best thing I’ve seen today.
Amazing
his tongue 💀😂
Can you elaborate about your cat getting old?
you left out of the title the fact that your cat is on ketamine or some other drug.  You actually think people will believe a warm compress on the eyes does that to a cat? lol.  that cat is high as fuck you know it.
This cat looks knocked out. Like with drugs. I hope not.
This looks like a cat still under the influence of anesthesia. I don't doubt that warm compresses were suggested by the vet, but the tongue out like that and motionless, this cat doesn't seem to be aware of wtf is going on right now. 

Anyways, hope he's doing better soon.
Actually cats stick out their tongues to cool off and if they are dehydrated. Maybe looks cute but it’s for a reason that the cat is prob too warm imo I could b wrong 😑 but they don’t stick out their toy he because they’re super comfy that would be absurd
Cat too hot?
Hope this absolute baby feels better
You dun phukd up.

He's gonna expect this of you from now on.
The song+the video scared me until I read the title
Yes
I bet he is going to fake illness after this luxury!
We need an "r/totallyrelaxedpets"
I love this so much
Lol is that woman's work by Kate Bush?

omg soo cute i wish i had a cat
Oh my, hilarious!
What a chill cat!
Aww what a sweet kitty. I hope he feels better soon.
You sure you didn’t go to the taxidermist?
So lucky to have a cat like this.
That cat does not look real…seriously
*pepecrying*
That tongue out is exactly how my cat looked after she died from liver failure earlier this year.
Other people have such chill cats. Mines a homie but not that much of a homie
Ah, the look of pure and unfettered bliss...pampered kitty indeed!
take my vote
Coronavirus?
u/Ok-Supermarket-9961
You must have the resolution of a warrior god, I would not be able to resist tweaking that pink tongue.
Me on mondays lol
Did the vet also recommend the towel straightjacket?
Awwwfully cute! 😂😁❤️🥰
Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice marrying my college sweetheart. She's amazing and I love her, but she's allergic to cats...
All I want rn is to be that cat for a day...
cat.exe has stopped responding
He wants chicken soup.
Cat is one with piece
Kitty ~ Carol, hold all my calls.
You sure your cat’s not dead? Lbs
Poor baby. Hope kitty feels better soon
Blep
Hihi, derp.
You treat that cat better than I treat myself when I'm sick
Would you go to do spa time with the cat
He’s blissed out
This video is like a warm compress for my eyes! Thanks for sharing
I'm gonna do this after the shower after work.

Cat's got me forgetting about the rest of the day.
How chill is this little guy omfg.
You sure he's alive?
He’s really taking advantage of his cold. Hehehehe
omggggg 😭

This is amazing.

plot twist: cat is dead
I didn’t even know cats got colds.
I love this

Omg that is bomb!  I’m so jelly at kitty’s comfort : )
I love your cat
The music is oddly fitting
I'm jealous of a cat...oh no
Poor little bug. I hope they feel better quick. Good thing they have someone who loves them so much taking care of them.
I can’t be the only one that saw the first part and thought it was a hamster
Awwww he’s being pampurred
Lol 😆
And now, for a long prolonged blep
You do kind of get the impression that this is the followup to a hot stone massage :)

Awwww, hope he feels better soon!
Spaw day
he ded, right?
I must do this for my Persian. Lol
One of my kitties got a cold 2 weeks ago. I reget not trying this
Are colds very common in cats? I've never had a cat that got one. So am I lucky, or is that the norm?
Poor little thing.
I hope my cat doesn’t see this…
Is his name Sylvester? Now I know why that character was drawn with his tongue out and spoke with a lisp all the time.
This is by far the most blessed image I’ve seen on the internet
How is the kitty just staying still like that? My cat would never tolerate that
I'll take a million
Lol!
TIL Cats can catch a cold.
Took me awhile to realize its on loop. Lol

That is one relaxed kitty 🥺
I HAD JUST TAKEN A SWIG OF BEER WHEN I SCROLLED UPON THIS HOW DARE YOU? HOW DARE.
That pink nose and tongue is adorable.
Poor congested kitty.

Ahhh sigur….

So cute
Yes human, now don’t forget the shoulders
That's a blocked nose all right. Poor thing, the forced mouth breathing is the worst part of a cold.
Cmon Chase
![gif](giphy|3oEjI4sFlp73fvEYgw)
I think hes just trying to do the Albert Einstein tongue out-pose
Poor fur baby. I hope they feel better soon and enjoy the added pampering
I'm sorry your kitty is sick. But that is adorable, thank you for sharing.
I don't blame him. A warm face compress is the best.
Me on an automatic diamorphine IV.

(In a medically relevant situation. don't do opioids folks)
Kitty is determined to enjoy the rest of his nine lives just about like this.
awww cute
Living the life 😂😂
Soo cutiee
Lucky cat!
Zen moment
I think he likes it
This is a vibe
*PSBattle in 3…2…1…* **GO!**

And we don’t even get to see his face nice job op.
That cat is having a better day than me, wtf
5-star service that there

Cute kitty 🐈‍⬛

You've placed the cat back in the bag.

I wish I could get my girl into a purrito.  She refuses
Is it a real cat? Need proof!

Oh my goodness! Kitty is loving the pampering. Hope he is 'feline' better soon!
Awwwhahah
Oh my gowsh 🥰
Cats get colds? Like runny nose and cough? How sad
God damn he's enjoying life lmfao
Feel like it’s a cross between an r/funny and r/awww post! So hilariously adorable
if he's got stuffed sinuses it probably feels amazing.
I wanna be that cat
Nice
Your cat has covid
Something wrong with your cat, bro
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Enjoying his spa time a little too much.
It's be even more perfect if the cat let out a soft fart.


*"pfffftttttt"*
OMG! Living his best life right there!
My cat wouldn't let me do anything like that to her
# blep
You sure? Might be dead
Is he pining for the fjords?
Looks like she has fever. Hope she gets well soon
This is the best thing I’ve seen all week! 😎
Any vets or cat people in here? How do i know when my cats get a cold? One of my babies eyes water at random.
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

I don't want to comment because that means I'd have to stop replaying the video!

Enjoying a little too much chk it’s pulse🙀
This made my day lol
Who the fuck leaves twister lying around? That's dangerous.
Good job caring for the kitty
Plays ded cutely
Grant us eyes!

Cats carrying covid yet? Never seen a cat cold
Don’t let my wife see this post.
Awww, I bet the warm compress feels good on his sore eyes <3 Feel better soon!
Hows the little guy feeling?
I guess we can use this in the dictionary for the term "CATatonic"
The single drool drip says it all.
This is so adorable
So cute 💕

LOL!
So trustful
Is it normal to take a pet to the vet with symptoms as insignificant as cold symptoms?
Or he’s dead?  (I hope not)
Is it too much to ask for a giant to put a warm compress over my eyes and cradle me to sleep
Is it bad that I thought there was a slab of meat on his head?
That cat is having his great time
That's too adorable!
A cat can catch cold?
Hilarious
Awwww feel better soon Sir cat
I taught I taw a pussytat. 

Cutie reminds me of Silvester. :)
Haha how cute
That’s one chilling cat.
I'm a vet tech and I feel like the clients always laugh off/never actually use a warm compress/hot towel. I hope you're one of mine.
It does appear to be enjoying it very much
Omg. I love this so much! Seriously made my day. Hope he's feeling better <3
Is this potroast?
lovely girl
Poor kitty!
Can you adopt me ??
Is that Jónsi music in the background?
This is cute beyond all levels
Oh my gosh. I needed to see this after a rough day at work. Thank you for sharing!! 
Hopefully your kitty feels better soon.

How can i download this video?
That cat’s sinuses are in heaven
No disrespect I thought he was dead my apologies 💀

What song is this?!

ETA: Found it! Escape the World by Winter Foe.
I gotta try this with my old kitty. Hopefully he doesn’t spaz out.
The soothing music is a nice touch. I wanna be next.
This cat must be drugged.
Is kitty drugged with kitty cold medicine?
Awww
I swear to god you better update when he’s better 😭
Me: Thinking I would hear snoring, or something. *Turns on volume*

Sound: 🎶

Me: Oh...
I hope your little guy is feeling better soon.... nothing worse than a head cold!  He kind of looks like a little garden gnome with a brown woolly hat\~
I’m sorry for your cat, but I can’t stop laughing
I think he's half dead
Has already dead
Cat colds can be covid, btw.  They are one of the mammals that can get it.  Their symptoms end up more cold-like (including sneezing) than when humans get it.
Luxury
what a relaxed blep!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
For a second, I thought your cat was a 'client' of this lady:

https://youtu.be/8jTHg_Kn3hw
You should send this to your vet
Ya think
cute
Such a cute little derp! 🤣
This made me so incredibly happy to see
i mean, you cant blame him
This is a whole mood and i AM HERE FOR IT!
How can you tell it’s the right temperature? /s

I’m sorry your kitty is sick (I hope he feels better soon) I got a chuckle over how cute he looks with his compress

Bless! Prayers for a short illness. Poor baby. My kitty has gotten the sniffles too. All they need is love snuggles & warm blankets. And, I’ve put on the vaporizer when we go to bed.
Feel better soon!
The way you take care of that cat  😻
so sweet ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
He looks so zen being pampered (he thinks). I'm happy to see you him enjoy this. But we all know he will make you do this several times each day. ♥
What's the theory behind a warm compress for a feline cold in terms of pain management or healing?
I love this
Omg 😳 💕
Finally, treated the royalty I am. -Cat
Someone get this person a trash can.
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! <3
Thanks for making me smile!
How can I find the music in this clip?! Does anyone know what that song is called?
Wow thats really cute but your cat kinda looks mort :$
I want to tap his tongue
my dogs sleeps the same

We need more cat spa treatments
Poor baby 🥺 awe the trust is a beautiful thing!
This is the peak of relaxation

I'm so sorry you're sick, Mr. Cat. But, it looks like you're handling it fairly well. Some days we need the spa treatment. 😁😻
I love this it's so adorable❤❤❤
Too cute!!
I swear I wish that was me.
No way.
I want to go there.
So adorable!

When my cat required a warm compress on his foot, he literally peed on me each time. Completely involuntary—he was calm and not resisting me at all—but by the time my husband got home, I was down to our last towel and out of clean pants, because he had peed on me eight times…he found me sitting on the floor in my underwear with a towel folded up under the cat on my lap! 😂 

Much prefer your experience! Hope your purrbaby is doing well now. ❤️
Need more video of this cat! ❤️
Awww🥺 so sweet!😭 wonderful cat parent.🥰
Awww 😻
Awe
😂 My cat Bebe sticks her tongue out as well.

Cut the bs.That cat is either unconscious, or dead.

That's great, now imagine some poor orphan/hungry kid who has cold who could use your help as well
Who takes their cat to the vet for a cold!?
Semen works well too!
You're a pretty shitty owner if you put your cat through the trauma of a vet visit just for a cold
Your cat is dehydrated mate....
Wonder if it's covid. Cats be dying if that
Please don't generalize this behavior to all cats or you may be seriously scratched.
That thing is dead
Blep
I see you don't mention the type of sedative to start with.
