When people say stuff like "I never wanted a cat" and then they show off a cat that's all over them I feel like the cat is saying, "I never wanted you either bro."
My brother-in-law's girlfriend, Jane, was adamantly anti-cat.  "Dog Person only".

Then she met my Xena - Xena was raised by a 3 and a 5 year old and has grown up to be somewhat of a stuffed animal cat.  You can carry her around like a baby, dress her up, dance with her, she does not care, all attention is good attention.  So when Jane came over to our house for the first time a few years ago, Xena, afraid of nothing, gave her a warm greeting which included - "I have choosen you so you must pet me for the entirety of your stay here".

That was about two years ago, Jane now has 3 cats of her own.
My ex wanted cats and I didn't, so we compromised and got two cats. At first, I was very much of the "these are your cats, you take care of them," mentality.   

One day one of the cats ran off and we couldn't find it. We looked and looked with no luck. We finally gave up and went out with some friends. Before I knew it, I was sad drunk complaining to all my friends that my cat was missing. That's when I knew I had fallen for them.    

When we got home he was waiting for us by the back door.
If the first line of your title was a lie, you’d be the greatest negotiator of all time
When he gets into trouble you can yell KAKAROT
A lot of people think they aren’t cat people because they’ve never been around a cat that trusted them.  Once you earn the trust of a cat, you convert.
Who named Goku?? 

Same situation happened with me and my girlfriend. She compromised on the names and we ended up with Mothra, Ghidorah, and Rodan!
We found a stray cat outside our apartment a while back and I didn't want to keep it. My girlfriend wanted it so bad and I told her we could keep him if she named him Paint Bucket. I just knew she would never go for a name like that and we could just take him to a shelter. Now I have a cat named Paint Bucket. Mr. Pbu for short.
Cats are literally the sweetest, most social creatures, but they tend to only bond with their closest family so you would never know they are sweet unless you own one and make a special connection with it. My cats were always just as outwardly affectionate as our dog growing up.
Bro that little guy friggin loves you. You're a lucky dude, that kind of kitty love is incredibly special.
Was always a dog guy, never imagined I would own a cat.... Then my Ex dumped a foster cat on me that she couldn't care for when she left. Seven years later, he's one of the best animals I've ever cared for. Huge personality, absolutely hilarious, very, very (very) vocal. Am terrified of what it's going to be like when he eventually goes.

As someone who loves cats but doesn’t have one I feel huge amounts of jealousy :(

I live with my dad and since I’m gonna move out in a couple years cuz I’m 17 this year, he doesn’t see any point in getting any kind of pet, he likes cats but prefers dogs anyway.

When I was a kid I was scared of dogs and then got over it but then I was scared of cats. I finally got used to cats since my sister has one and I completely fell in love with them :(

I JUST WANT A BEAUTIFUL BLACK CAT PLEASE WORLD PLEASE
I was highly allergic to cats all my childhood but both grandparents from each side had a minimum of three that would make my nose run and eyes itch every holiday. I loved the heck out of cats but couldn't get near them without consequence.

Spent a lot of time at my in laws house when wife and I were dating and didn't seem to have much issue with their two cats but chalked that up to them not hanging out near me too often and mother in law vacuuming regularly. So got really nervous when my girlfriend, now wife, was desperately pleading to look at cats for our first apartment together. I just didn't want her to fall in love with one and me being the cause to need to get rid of it. 

Fortunately, my allergies seemed to subside from the years of stress testing. Our 2 cats don't bother me none. But our first one WORSHIPS me. Its like they know who didn't really want them* and hone in on those people. Sure he likes sitting in my wife's lap because I rarely sit on the sofa and I rotate in my sleep a lot so he sits by her in bed, but I get up, he follows. Its food time? He follows and begs from me. Get mandated to stay at work? Couldn't care too much if the wife is late, but will nervously pace at the door if I'm even 10 minutes behind. And you can bet my computer time is constantly interrupted by him wanting to curl up in my keyboard arm like a baby.
Adorable! And love the name.
> I'm happy she kept me on my promise.

We usually say "made me keep my promise".
My cat also loves laying on me while I play!!! The best loading screen distraction
CUTENESS IS OVER 9000!!!!
/r/PetTheDamnCat
Cats get a bad rap. They really are special in their own way. When they form a bond, as it appears yours has with you, they are your bestie for life.
I hated any kinds of pets then one day I finally caved in and said to my wife she could get a cat. My wife no longer has a cat and I now do. I deeply regret not letting her do this earlier, I love my, sorry, our cat.
My mom had a cat when I was growing up but she sort of hid in the basement and only came out for food so she wasn't a typical cat. Otherwise we only had dogs.  I got a cat when my wife and I moved in together and I absolutely adore her. She was runt in the litter but she's a beautiful calico named Lucy (Lucifer if she gets in trouble). What's funny is she absolutely adores my greyhound to the point she will lay at his head and groom him.
I love cats, and dogs.  But cats 'fuck it' attitude suits me more.

Unfortunately we rent and we can't have either in this place, so my wife has Guinea pigs.

Sometimes I think having a cat would make me feel better, mentally.
So sweet!!  I just don't understand people who are anti-cat who say they don't want them because they're not affectionate.  It's just different with cats.  They don't jump on you as soon as you come in the door, but if you sit down they're sure to want a cuddle.
Rule number one of the cat psyche:  
"everybody loves me.  They just don't know it yet"
I never had much with pets. But my wife really wanted a cat.

Now I’m the one who gets out of bed at 3am to check if he’s ok when he’s been fighting. He loves to sit on my lap when I’m watching tv. I love that furball
People who don’t like cats have never had a cat.
I was never a cat person but my wife was. She got a few cats over the years. Just recently we got another that has become my baby. Now I’m a cat person.
Aww! He loves you!
Mine figured out which button to stand on to power off.  I don't use an official controller and mine has blue lights over the power button.   My 20 year old little boy looks me right in the eye while he stands on it.  He wins every time.
Goku le gana.
Aww!! This is how I enden up with two cats and a dog
My sis and brother in law very begrudgingly took in my beloved car when I was going through a hard time. They both hated cats and I was so worried to give him to them. Fast forward one week and I’m getting pics of him laying on their bellies and she’s asking me what toys he might like beat from Amazon.
He must think you’re Cell cause he’s trying to give you his Senzu beans💖
He is one big ball of love. A rescue?
Awww the little cuddle bug getting a snuggle in
Hi Goku! I’m Grokfu!
Aww he looks just like my cat Sushi baby girl! I love tabby cats <3
True gamer right there! Can't be hard-core without a co pilot!
"This slave is....acceptable."
My Mrs and I adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago, and the cat loves to sit in my lap while I'm on the PS4 and follows me everywhere I go. I was always a dog person but now I have a cat I absolutely love her to bits. The Mrs gets really jealous of how much the cat likes me lol.
u/savevideo
Goku's a little cuddle beast.
I was always dog person. I never wanted cats. But i have one.

Moment they notice someone who disputes them they move themselves in persons life. Just to piss them off.

Cats are assholes. Adorable assholes
Goku looks exactly like my husband's cat Yoshi and Goku is what he wanted to name him originally but I thought Yoshi fit him better. So funny
Goku is the best wingman
That's not gross and manipulative at all.. oh wait
awwww
Internet is a place where you come to love animals
How could you not absolutely love this precious baby,sooooooo added 💗🐾🐱
I promised my cats that I would get a girlfriend
I feel you bro. Exact same story here.
I never liked cats either until I took in a rescue at the behest of the now wifey.  Never thought I’d become so attached.
They make your life so much better.
Such a sweet and adorable cat. Ours only approach us when he's hungry.
My husband never wanted a cat. I bribed him with a year worth of ironing & a new PC gaming monitor. The cat now prefers my husband 😩🙄
That is so fucking cute. I wish my cats snuggled me like that when i play my video games 😂 instead, they just try to sit on my controller 🙄
So cute

I'm so jealous. I've love a snuggly chill cat like that. The only ones I've ever had in family have been extremely boring cats who are absolutely touch-phobic, ignore you almost completely, and who you see two hours a day when they're hungry :(
Are we looking at the same picture? I just see a playstation controller and a kakarot.
Idk about what OP wanted as pets, but Goku looks like he’s always wanted OP 😍😭
My buddy is asleep on my lap rt now.  I rub her belly til she goes to sleep.
Girlfriend wants cat. Girlfriend negotiates cat into the house. Cat ends up spending all its time with the boyfriend and not girlfriend. The ole switcharoo.
Oh my days. That cat loves you so much.
Ha my little guys do this when I play. They have a knack for crawling over hands while I'm in the middle of a bosd fight, which isn't super helpful, but they get a free pass because they are so fucking cute
People that say they don't like cats never took the time to get to know one.  Once you do, you're a fan for life!
What a sweet boy, cats are fucking awesome.  They’re so intelligent and I hate when people think cats are assholes.  They are but they’re also sweet and affectionate.
Classic. First you never want cats, then you are forced into owning one, then cat gives you attention and trust, and then you feel privileged with that attention and become a cat person. But only your cat 'cause other cats are gross.
Aweee s(he) loves you so much ... and it’s clear you love him a helluva lot too!
Cats are awesome if you treat them correctly. They don't like to be treated the same way as dogs.
El Dorko
This deserves an awwww.
Dude he freaking love you!
What a love! We have a big old tabby boy who loves to curl up on my husband’s laptop while he games. The best gaming buddy.
Goku uhhhh
I think that cat is going to eventually warm up to you.
Wait until he become ultra instinct in the middle of the night.
Such a good gif, and a happy kitty with someone who cares for him. Good for you and the girlfriend!
What an affectionate baby. So cute!
Cats are underrated.
He is so sweet.
Goku is so nice I'd die for him
So, you got a cat, but did she?
AWWW! Goku is pretty cool!
Its always the one who is against getting a cat getting along with the cat the best in the long term
Good on you. Btw, tabbies, especially the mackerel colored like yours, are very affectionate and playful in my experience. I'm more of a dog person but cats seems to like me lol.
Cat: Oh, so you don't like me? Let me show you why you are wrong.
Oh my god your boy looks so much like my little guy Monster. And he does this exact same thing. He lies down between my arms when I'm gaming, doesn't matter if it's keyboard or controller. 

He also does it when I try to work, then he lays down over my mouse arm.
u/megaarms
Hahaha this is so funny because you definitely seem like a cat guy the way Goku cuddles on you. BTW that’s a fucked up cat name. That cat has a lot to live up to now.
The amount this cat loves you is insane. Cherish every waking minute of this because he is just a part of your life, you are all of his.
Omg Goku is so sweet! A buddy that will enrich your life 😻
Bro, sames. I'm picking up a kitten today.
He loves you!
Now you're hooked for life.

Sincerely, cat owner for 15 years and counting.
Cats are genuine treasures. I just lost mine baby of almost 18 years last weekend, whom I raised since the day she was born in my dresser drawer. Love your buddy.
Goku is a king. I also did not really care for cats previously - the seemed so aloof and kind of like assholes. Then I found a cat under my porch and he is the sweetest little cuddler. Sure he's still kind of an asshole, but he's very nice for a cat.
He's like, "Dude you suck at this game. Push the circle button, then square. Duh"
I’m so happy for you! He looks like the bestest bud one could ever ask for.
He must be the most powerful cat
Awww so cute
What a beautiful love
Cats are fuckin awesome man.  I always had dogs growing up so was never much of a cat person.  Then when my now wife and I got engaged she really wanted a cat so I relented and absolutely fell in love with the little guy.  It's truly crazy how much smarter they are and how much more independent they are than dogs.  My favorite is when he comes over and bops the top of his head against my palm like "hey hooman, u pet now".
If i pet my cat too long he turns around offended then runs away.

You got a cuddler. Score!
Gotta admire that you kept an open mind regarding your buddy...not like you had a choice but Goku appreciates it anyways :)
My cat's names are Chichi and Bulma.
That white destiny controller tho
Congratulations on your evolution to Cat Guy! 🍾
Just saying that’s an awesome name.
Aww Goku
He's beautiful!  😍
Oh so he LOVES you loves you.
lol - you didn’t actually keep your promise. That’s your cat not hers.
that is a very nice cat.

God I love cats so much. greatest beings in the universe, especially this cat. may he live the best life he can
It's alright we were all the "not  cat type person" until we got one in our lives. See you in a little while when you get another :p
I was one of those Cat deniers! Then Renly the cat came into my life and the two of us now chill.
That love-claw at the end got me
Oh, please share this over at /r/ConvertedCatPeople. Stories like this are why I created that sub.

The epitome of “dad doesn’t want a cat” meme
You gunna have his tail removed before the next full moon?
Are these tabby cats? My ex’s roommate had a cat that looked like this, brown and black, and he was the sweetest kitty I’ve ever met. Definitely would like one of my own eventually.
Brown tabbies are the sweetest
[deleted]
Just saying my gaming skills and my work typing skills suffered when the cat arrived but it is worth it for sure!
You don’t have to make up the girlfriend part man it’s OK to just like cats.
👏 👏 non-cat people are just people who have never had cats 👏 👏
so....where's *her* cat?
You'll need to get a second one a spayed female and name her chichi or goku is gunna get lonely
You should love both cats  and dogs equally even if cats are usually jerks more often then dogs.
Your kitty seems to love you, cats are on another level than dogs when they open up to you
Now you need Vageta!
Are ya winnin Dad?
When does she get HER cat?
I love that he’s kneading your hand. He loves his daddy. 🤗
Cats are sweet creatures :-)
I have had a serious phobia of cats ever since that stray cat tried to scratch me on my paper route as a kid. I avoided all kitty’s at all costs and was terrified to be in the room with one. An old girlfriend of mine, her parents had three cats and whenever we’d stay there it was pure torture I was constantly on edge.

This year my roommate (who is a vet tech) brought home 2 two week old kittens that needed fostering. They were both extremely malnourished and both had a the feline version of HIV and ringworm. One of the kittens didn’t survive the night but the other, Indy pulled through. Because of the ringworm and the fact we have dogs it had to stay in its own room for a few weeks as it got better. When my roommate was at work I’d hear it prance about. Eventually I would sit by the door and play with it underneath. As the ringworm healed I eventually started hanging out with the kitten and now It’s been six months and I’m in love. I even play with other cats now too. 

Phobias can be overcome and I am now a cat lover. One day I might get a cat of my own and call it Tugboat
oh my gosh he LOVES you what a BABY
A friend once told me “Everyone is a cat person with the right cat” and I think this couldn’t be more true.
Who doesn't like cats? I would like to have thirty
And some people actually say that cats aren't affectionate.🤔😎
Aww, Goku seems pretty happy that you kept your word, too!!
I love you, Goku
How do you get a “good” cat though? My friend has a tabby and I swear her personality is like the spawn of Satan incarnate.
Cats and dogs are both amazing pets that offer different perks.
Decent name - had a different one in mind though
Really wish our cat wasn't a literal sociopath.  Still, understanding our cat's psyche has given me insight into human sociopaths as well.
I'm not really good with cats. But recently one of my girlfriend's daughters has a cat that's warmed up to me. Just a couple hours ago she came into my room and put her nose up to my nose. I petted her for a while and she purred so loud. I'm glad you made a new friend!
Does your cat do kamehameha?
The exact post I needed ☺️
Wait... what?

I don’t think I’m reading it right. 

You let you girlfriend get a cat if she moved to your town. Or... did you offer the promise of buying her a cat as an incentive to get her to move to your town?

Also, was it her choice to name her Goku?

Sorry, maybe there’s some some clarification that’s missing coz a lot of this is sounding toxic as fuck.
How can a person not want cats, I don't get it
I think cats would be more popular if more cats were like this.  But with cats, you just never really know what you're getting with a kitten.  I've owned many in my life and raised them all the same and most of them are just indifferent and always on their own program, or just kinda ass holes.  Though I have been lucky enough to have a few who act like this, seems random.
Damn you really bribed her with a cat lol. Smart thinking. You know we women will fall for that!!
Bf: "We're not getting a cat."

Gf: *gets a cat anyway*

Bf and the cat:
Ah yes, the negotiator.
Tabby's are almost too affectionate.
He's wonderful.
Let me tell ya from experience. This is your peak gift, but they will keep telling you how much they loved it. 

It’s a lose-win.
r/Mensmittenwithkittens
Bruh same with me except my girl was just asking for a year straight. I finally told her yes. We named him Goku as well!!!! Then we broke up 3 months later & she took him. I wish you better juju my friend 😂
Cats always seem to know who ISN'T a cat person, seeks them out, and makes them like cats.  He loves the hell out of you!
Give him lots of cuddles and pets
A good cat is the best. A bad cat is not. True story.
I would love to have I cat too... but i'm allergic on their hair...
Awwww!!!
Man... you still owe her a cat lol
What a gentle love!
This warms my heart so much. He's so affectionate!
See its already taking away from ur me time and making it about him, no...just no...
So, you're his new human, are you? 🤔
"Why hasn't anybody given this the Take My Energy award?"

I think he likes you
Just a LPT, get a second cat.

Cat's are social animals and they require company. If you guys are both working full time, do your cat a favor and get her a buddy. Now that you have a cat, it's not really a difference if it's one, two or three of them.
Aww sooo cute😍😍😍
Is sad now :(

I was that guy. Now I have 9 cats
My cat's name is Goku as well... and he even looks the same! O.o

Bro wdym that’s obviously beerus
Since Goku has chosen you, that means you can never break the arrangement.
I have one like this too.

I call her 'Groot'.

She's one of the friendly ones, but she does her own thing, always.

And you did want a cat, you just never knew.
I love cats so much
He’s Adorable
I want this cat!  Look at that face!!
GOKU WANTS SCRITCHES
Same. When my now wife and I moved in together she had a cat and I have never really been a cat person. Her cat and I had a grudging respect for one another until he died. I was sad and I buried him for her, but soon after there was a cat that needed a home and I took her in. She’s my buddy and we have a great bond.... it’s weird lol.
Goku wants to watch you play some games!
I need this in my life, it's been a long week.
LOOK AT THAT BABYYYYYYYY
Just watch that cat go Ultra instinct When he gets moved by him 😅
Can he Kamehameha?

Some cats like Goku are so sweet and awesome and some cats are the devil lol
That’s so freaking cute
Taby Cats are great company
Do you wear your headphones like that all the time?
You named them Goku?!
You're just the best pet owner
My wife has two cats.  They both love me!  LOL.   Honestly though, cats are just easier pets overall.
See there is "Dog People" and then there is "Cat People"

=p Cat People are happier.  = No Barks, or cold weather walks, easier to maintain, no need 24/7 surveillance 

Dog People = Babysitters for life, Better Hope you live in warm climate, whole home destroyed if you have huge dog/s. 

I was dog person for most of my life, but when i gotten 2 cats, after my last doggy died, i never want dogs again. 

Cats are best. =) people that say otherwise haven't experienced the love a cat gives.   Cat Love is earned not just given.
The irony in her wanting to get a cat and then getting said cat and then it ending up that YOU got said cat and she gets to watch.
My problem is that I'm a cat person but with pretty bad cat allergies, and dogs in my life have always hated me for no reason so now I have an innate distrust and dislike of dogs.

On the bright side, not wanting any pets is cheaper and less time consuming than having a pet.
How dare he. He's so precious 😭

Real men love cats!
My bf said he never would get a cat. One day I found a 3 week old kitten in a dumpster (sadly) I waited around 30 min for a momma, nothing so I got him out. I decided I would bottle feed him and then put him up for adoption. Later that day when I brought him home he only wanted to be with my bf and only wanted to be fed by him. My bf fell in love with him that night. He now is an adult, yet only weighs 3.5 lbs and is tiny. He is so smart yet only still wants to be with my bf. We now have another cat too.
Meet Goku, the gamer cat
Does his fur become golden/red/blue/white when he screams?
Why you take video when you should be stroking? Bad human! Stroke kitty!
Awwwwww.....him loves you!
But can he beat Thanos?
I presume you realize you can never move that arm again now.  

At least not until the cat decides you can.
I wish my boy would cuddle like that. He's too busy playing fetch.
Is he gonna evolve to super saiyan?😂
No one ITT commenting on how OP needed to bribe his girlfriend to move in with him, lol

My car does this to me when I’m trying to game as well but she also tries bite my fingers if I don’t pet her.
Blessed cuddles!
What a promising healthy relationship 😂

Once they trust you cats are seriously the best companions. I don't understand people who don't love them. Enjoy life with your new buddy!
So who keeps the cat when she leaves?
What a cute name. Just be careful around full moon

That guy: i dont want a cat.         His gf: no lets get a cat.           That guy: gets a cat and loves that cat
This guy is weird. "If you move to my town I'll get you a kitten."

I would call mine Beerus :)
I had a cat called Goku when i was a teen, and he looked just like your Goku! He went missing shortly after we moved and even now, 15+ years later, I miss him so much and wish I knew what happened to him.
What an affectionate cat <3
So she moved town and you got adopted!😁
Cool kitty.
Looks to me as if your gf didnt get a cat...nor did you...looks more like the cat got a you.
My cat lays this exact same way when I’m gaming on my PC lol. She attacks my mouse hand and has killed me a few times haha.
That's one nice fkn kitty right there
Kakarot seems like a pretty chill dude.
Obviously part of this deal was that you also got to name the cat, I’m guessing
Congratulations.  I’m low key jealous.  I have a Persian cat and he is not this affectionate.
Immediately when I saw the name of the cat I thought “Ultra instinct”
I forgot how loud the PS4 is.
Bruh i didn’t know cats were supposed to be nice to you
Look at your cat all polite and not trying to suffocate you or lay on your controller while you play like mine does. xD
Sweet
Welcome of the club of boyfriends who didn't want cats! U have been chosen.
Does he have super pawer?
You can only love your cats that much. 
My husband and I wanted a pet  and we decided to adopt a cat. Then when I saw two females sisters for adoption, he said why not get them? 
They are with us for the past 3 years now, they are so sweet, and it was one of the best decision we both took.
Your buddy is gorgeous
My kittens like to sit on my lap while I play games. Sometimes they watch the tv screen and they seem to be like really attracted to it lmao
Awwwwww.
The kitty loves you.
Kakarot!!!!
That face is presh.
Kamehamehaaaa!!!
If you were super small that cat would eat
Kamehame-hi Goku!
So back in the day Cats were worshipped like gods. 

It seems like in today's world, cats are giving thanks to us humans for doing so :)
That car better be learning how to play games lol.
He’s too precious
Aww, we names our little guy majin boo-boo, (or boo for short)
Lol is that your PS4 making vacuum cleaner noises ? I can recognize that noise from kilometers away
Ahhhhh the sweet old sound of a PlayStation 4 getting ready for take off!
You didn't name him catkarot? How could you miss such a golden opportunity D:
Looks just like my cat Tommy that I adopted from the pound. He lives with my parents now and just turned 15. Now you just need to get a cat named Vegeta
My friends cat convinced me I actually liked cats. Was always a dog person but when I was at his house and his cat made me pet him I changed my mind.
Looks like you still owe her one.
Love ultimatums!
I'm always a little jealous when I see cats like this, because mine is a little asshole who loves to sink his unusually-huge claws into my leg to get my attention, with zero escalation lol. That, and if I'm asleep and he needs to be pet, he'll chomp into my hand, which definitely wakes me up.
Same exact thing happened to me!
Fuck yeah bro! Great name! My cats are Goku and Chi Chi
My family’s first cat was named Goku as well. He was a good friend I miss him dearly
😍
KAKAROOOOOOOOT!!!
I got my cat and i named her Bulma. I been looking for her Vegeta but i have accidentally found her goku.
Gaming buddy 🤘🏻
I think you meant SON!!!! Goku
This is a real life version of the “dad doesn’t want cat... family gets car anyways, Dad and the cat”
He loves you so much
She let u name it Goku she’s the best
Same here.
U/savevideo
“No play... pets”
Humans: *trying to focus on anything*


Cats: Pet me
Game over son, that cat has claimed you
He loves you so much! So sweet.
That's precisely precious
I love you Goku
He's so snuggly!
People that don’t like cats just haven’t met a good one. Probably because 90% of them are crap.
Looks like you got yourself an excellent r/standardissuecat
Cute level OVER 9000!
Goku, lol
I want a cat, but because of the pandemic everyone wants a pet and now they're like £500 for some no name breed and grands if you want anything pedigree.
Yeah I never thought of myself as a cat person until I got one. I never knew what I was missing!
Real trust there
Pet. The. Kitty.
He looks so sweet!!!!
This is all I want for my life.
Years ago I used to live with two silver-tipped Burmese who were scarily intelligent, ten times smarter than any dog I've ever met. Leo used to like perching on my shoulder like a parrot as I was moving around the house. I'm still a dog person though - we're just willing slaves to those felines.
Super Saiyan God
Oh Goku loooooves you
what a good boy
Oh, named your cat Goku huh?  Take my reluctant upvote.
She chose a cat over you already, bro if she didn’t want to move there unless you bought her something...
I get it. I never wanted cats either. I got one as an experiment and he's pretty great.
This way with my wife. Told her once we got our first home we could rescue a cat. Well one fell into our lap and he is anything but normal. Likes to cuddle. Likes belly rubs. His voice box is messed up so he can’t meow like normal, but he sure can scream and chirp. And he and our golden retriever are like best friends. I often find them cuddling on the couch when I get home from work and come in from doing yard work. I don’t ever want another cat because it won’t be like this one.
Aw, he loves you so much. Look at his eyes.
Ohh all the love the in those eyes  ♥️
Sometimes we need to stop and think, "Maybe that cat wants me." Welcome to the fold, bröther.
Does he meow or just kamehameha?
What a sweet disposition :)
My husband said "I love cats.  I have a lot of good recipes."  Now he has rules about how to keep the cats safe, outdoor houses in the event they are outside and need protection.  Whatever.
People always say they don't like cats


And then they get a super sweet cat. Cause most cats are super sweet tbh. Most of the time, the hell cats are because some shit head treated it badly as a kitten. Put it in a pillow case and hit it against walls or couches kinda shit.
I miss having a cat so bad. My mom got married and my step dad is allergic so we can't anymore.
Same! I've always wanted a dog of my own since I was little. Heck, even bought my own condo so I can. 
First animal was a rescued kitten from my work that my girlfriend asked if we could keep. 
We named the kitten Mau and she's the most affectionate loving kitten. 
I would do anything for her!! I love my little Mau ♥
Hi Goku!!!😻😻😻
The best cats!
So cute
I was the same way with cats, I wasn't a fan until my fiance talked me into adopting one. Love that cat.
The human heart is big enough for cats, and dogs.  I'm a dog person by preference, but a good kitty snuggle warms the heart.  

Also, two Marmalade cats named Todd and Nugget come to see me when I'm at work and it's awesome--like, they see my van and come running to greet me, and then aggressively snuggle.
I think you mean "my new bff'
r/PetTheDamnCat
Now, u had two girlfriends :)))
Looks like the cat was debating turning your hands to spaghet with those claws
So the compromise was, if you get a cat, you get to call it "Goku"
Aw, that is such a cute cat! I have two, one is a lap cat and sometimes cuddler, the other wants to play more than cuddle, but occasionally does what I call “super purr mode” where he really wants to be pet and tolerates cuddles more (and purrs much louder than usual!). There’s just something sweet about when a cat wants some love.
The people who dont want pets, often dont want them because they understand how much love and care and responsibility will be required of them, and they understand that they will, without question, expend all their time and energy on that care and love and responsibility. They inevitably end up with pets because people they love want pets, and they cannot help but want them to be happy, so the people they love, adopt more animals that need love, and the person who did not want a pet, winds up a love factory, beloved by those who rely on them.
/u/vredditshare
Cats always seem to know the person who doesn't really like cats and work hard to try to get that person to change their mind. 😂
Beautiful and adorable ❤️
Wishing you all many happy, healthy, and prosperous years together!
OMG! He looks just like my Uub!
No purer love than a Father and that thing he swore he never wanted. 

Love you dad.
Cats choose you.
Goku? Don’t get him mad...
I'm a firm believer (as one of these people myself) that not many "dog people" area really dog people but are rather pet people who haven't had the joy of having and taking care of a cat of their own. I love my dog and I loved my dogs growing up but I always hated cats because every cat I met was aggressive (which I later found out was due to how they were raised). My mother never socialized me with her cat when I was a baby/toddler and then friends cats were always just "around" but never seemed like part of the family. I now have 3 cats and a dog and I love each of them equally with all their own personalities and traits making each one super unique.
People have a lot of misconceptions about cats.  They love attention and are funny friends.
Definitely over 9000 on the cute scale
lol I love how he digs his claws in when you don't pet him
The PAW AT THE END 😭💕💕
Goku now owns you.
I was the same. I had a cat fall into my life, I am 100% a cat person now. I love them, your cat is cute! We have a grey tabby at home, he is an amazing companion.
He looks so much like my buddy Steve. We lost him Friday. The eyes and stripes are very similar but Steve was more grey. The most affectionate cat I’ve met.
I wish my cat did this . Adopted him a week ago and only thing I got is scratches and hissing :P
People who don't like cats are people who haven't met the right cat yet.
My sister’s cat always loved to say hi to me and cuddle with me but idk if I was just a heat source for the cat or it actually loved me
Glad to see he still has his tail XD
Goku is so chubby and sweet
People who don't  like cats have never had cats.
you got one o them good cats :)

but honestly theyre all good if raised in a loving home
I had some similar experience. My flatmate wanted one, i wasn't happy with this but agreed to it. In the end the felin was my buddy the 3 years we lived together, i was devasteted to leave him in the end.. :'(

You don't own a cat, it owns you.
Can he go super saiyan tho?
Very cute together!
He's cranking the old Lovey Eyes up to maximum
My mother was terrified of cats. So my cat Amadeus hopped on her lap every time when she was visiting, which he didn't normally do. Almost as if he wanted to convince her of himself.
cats like i'm just chill here why you play they game... taps the thumb... ok play.. taps again... no really play i'm chill here and watch.
Awesome name!
I think we may be living parallel lives. I swore I’d never get a cat, girlfriend moved in with me and we adopted a kitten 3 months later. He also climbs over me while I play video games.
Make sure to get Chi-chi when Goku grows up.

&#x200B;

Edit: Actually Goku met Chi-chi when they were  young. So time to find Chichi now.
I wish I had a cat like that
I miss my cat so much. It’s been over 2 years but I still cry sometimes.
Hes so chill!! Too sweet!
Awwwe
Ive never been a cat person. But this seems like a real cool cat.
Hit the B button!!!
After me and my wife got married, got a new place she asked for a cat. I figured why not. This cat. 8 years later. I've never loved a pet more. Cats have healing magic I swear.
That cats got a neat name, I'm just saiyan..
I wish my cat snuggled like that.
Wait until it goes Super Saiyan and annihilates all your enemies...
Are you winning OP?
This hit me right in the feels.. I had a cat who was really a part of the family that looked exactly like this also with the same name, Goku! Not a day goes by that I think of his purring and comfort
This is the cutest thing ever!! ❤❤
KAKAROT!
Man... I miss my buddy, McNuggets.. he was the best boy. I know what you mean man, was never into the whole cat thing. Until I became a cats “person”.. I adopted one on a whim. And he was my shadow, I loved how when my house was full with my roommates and guests, he’d socialize but he always came to me and sat on my lap. It was just special. Anyway, enjoy your time with Goku man 🤍
dad: *doesn't want cat*
family: *gets cat anyway*
dad and cat:
Everybody gangsta until a snuggle buddy curls up on your arm :)
I feel bad for people with a cat that doesn’t like to cuddle.
What a cute little sweetheart :)
I too have a loveable cat that I didn't want named Goku. 

My son bonded with a kitten my in-laws found on Christmas, I spent most of the drive home halfheartedly muttering "Dammit"

So his full name is Goku Christmas Dammit

Edit: spelling
Cats are good companions like dogs they like owners who are ice and you have to earn their trust the difference is that a cat leaves and comes back it for some reason is nice cause for a moment you can chill alone dogs are ride or die companions it’s nicer for me but for those who get annoyed easily with things bothering them constantly cats are better
Yeah.  He owns you now 😝
Aw, what a sweetie! My boyfriend grew up a dog person, owned dogs on and off over the years before I met him, thought he was allergic to cats. Turns out he's allergic to street cats covered in dirt. He will go face first into my indoor cat's fur, rub his face into her belly, and not react at all. He's still mid-conversion to cat person (still pets a little too roughly and tries to play like you would with a dog), he's just lucky my cat is non-violent (won't scratch or hiss or bite at all) and very patient. He now greets her before me most of the time lol.
This is acceptable
My cat’s name is also Goku and looks just like yours!
Same story here didn’t like cats but told my woman she could get one if she moved in. Well now I’m a fan of cats and would die for my fur baby
Wow, very cute
I am [real](https://youtu.be/7pSmhZFbCy0) Super Sand Legend!
Oh my goodness. He loves you so much. So sweet!
Awww he loves you!
Goku is very confused why he doesn't have your full attention, never underestimate a Z fighter.
/r/murdermittens would love this.
I'll stand by for video when he goes Super Cat!
I'm convinced most people who claim to not want cats have just been around mean cats and never experienced life with an affectionate cat like this.
Goku you are beautiful snuggle kitty.❤️🥰 Sir you have a friend for life!
He only loves you because you have a PS5. 😉
I lost my little bb a lil over two months ago and your goku reminds me of her.

Thanks for this :')
I thought I was a dog person before finding one of my best friends in a parking lot. 

She is 4 now and sleeping on my pillow.
Coon cats are da bomb yo!
🥰
So when does she get her own?
I’ve never been a cat person but it’s posts like these that are slowly converting me.
Cute cat!! I have a black floofy one with the same name. You’re a DragonBall fan, I assume?
I love when the dudes who never wanted a cat just fricken melt for the fur baby when they finally get one !
Goku really said this is a two player game now
u/savevideo
Son kun!
Using animals as emotional leverage so you can get laid makes you a scumbag.
Hello Goku
So friking cute
My girlfriend would always tell me that her cat was not a lap cat when we first started dating and now he likes to sleep between my legs in bed and on my lap at my desk. He’s the best little furball monster
Good
Once you move your hand its over
Hahahaha- well, you’ve got a cat now!

Welcome to the club.
They are such precious little beings.   A+
Hes so trusting!
Imagine that cat poop on his table by accident
My boyfriend has one cat. I have three. We moved in together, so now we habe four. At first he hated it, but now I think he secretly loves my cats a little more. The one he "hated" is always cuddling with him now.
You promised she’d get one? You mean you promised she could get one?
Look at this lovey baby!!!
I dread the day when we get ultra instinct cat
Great name! Adorable little guy. Cats are great
My husband never wanted cats. Now we have 2 🖤
Congrats on your new buddy.  I await pics of your second cat Vegeta.
So sad to see a cat in love with a man that does not love cats 😔
Goku is telling you that he wants pets.
You have been chosen
 starts with one lol
Uhhh I think somebody might be very much in love
Oh, he loves you so much!
At least you chose the right name
This is just,hands down.the most cutest thing I’ve ever seen
Cuddly boi 🤗
[deleted]
I named my stardew valley cat goku lol
Every guy I know who ended up with a cat they didn’t want but ending up loving it named it goku.
Super
Good stuff
Goku is such a sweet kitty, you got lucky. I don’t like cats that much but I swear if I had a really sweet lovable one I’d change my mind.
Omg, that melted my heart. That is cat love right there!
Stripy bois are always very sweet and affectionate (IMO)
Yea that’s great, but can this cat turn in to Super Saiyan??
Same thing happened to me except my gf left me with the two cats and peaced out
I’ve said it before I will continue to say it. People who say they don’t want/like cats have not met the right cat.
Watch out his brother is gonna show up soon
Aww this reminds me of my fiance. When we were talking about moving in together I made it clear I would be getting a cat. He wasn't happy about it, but tolerated the idea. We've had the cat for 4 years and it's stupid how much they love each other. They have a really incredible bond. Makes my heart melt.
I think Goku quite likes you.
Such a sweet cat. He loves you so much!
“This is my human, there are many like him but, this one is mine”
Goku looks pretty chill. Take care of him and he'll take care of you. Promise.
My husband finally broke and got me one as well. We named him Geralt.
WHOLESOME SAIYAN MODE!!!
If you’re anything like my ex-husband, the cat will quickly warm up to you and you’ll be his favorite. It’s funny it turned out that way because he was reluctant to get a cat as well and it took a lot of convincing on my end to get one.
Awesome. Another cat dad converted 😊
He just kamehameha’d straight to my heart
cutie!
Well now you need a second one for her! 😛
And now your girlfriend wants a cat too...
They'll steal your heart!
I love the way his claws came out at the end, what a cutie...
Same here.  Was never really a cat person until I started living with one
The arm nook. Cute
Aw, he loves you and feels comfortable with you :) Hope the 3 of you have many happy years together!  Cats can be so awesome!
You are so lucky!!! He is going to be your best friend. Enjoy!
I’ll truly never understand how people don’t like cats. At all.
I went wrong and named my cat vegeta and now I have a little asshole that parkours all over my face when I sleep.
That's you told then! Hahahaha, welcome aboard!
Best name for a cat
🥺💕
goku looks incredibly comfortable right there.
Best girlfriend every!
Does it likes to fight with strong cats!
Now you need Vegeta and watch the havoc unfold.
OoOoOOOOoo meeellllllt - lookit him....total daddy's boy.........
I officially don't hate cats as much
My cat name is vegeta , they must be rivals
Power move:  get a girlfriend AND get your cat.
Wonder if the girlfriend realizes the cat chose him.
r/murdermittens
Too precious
Cat AND ps5 ?! You have everything I ever wanted
That ladies and gentleman is a good fucking kitty. Happy for you OP
My husband convinced me to adopt a kitten 6 years ago. Best kitty ever. Hiro is sweet and really loves cuddles. Now I want a second cat but my hubby doens't think it's smart because we want a baby first
How sweet!  I love tiger tabbies!! I have one as well!  He's a great cuddle bug and I leashed trained him as well
YOOOO IM PLANNING ON NAMING MY NEXT CAT GOKU
Was the same way when I met my wife, never liked cats and she had one. Fell in love with her and now we have a 2nd
That cat frickin loves you man.
Goku was so fast that he landed 10 punches on his thumb
Expected a cat named Goku to only have fur and a full tail on a full moon. Slightly disappointed.
sweet he melted your heart.
Aww, Goku loves you so much!
Cuteness Level : “It’s over 9000”
isn't that your son Goku I see?
D'aw. I had a cat named Goku and he was the bestest.
fun fact: 2 cats are actually easier than 1
Wait till he starts eating and biting all your cords lol
D’aww. The look on his face is pure love!
Geez, that seems like a dope cat. I can has it, tho?
I was allergic to cats pretty bad as a kid but after having them more than half my life- as long as i dont stick my face directly in their fur im all good now (and dont pet them and touch my face its not so bad.), Amen!
Goku is a sweet boy
His cuteness levels are over 9000!!
PET HIM OR I AM GONNA FOUND YOU AND BLOWN YOUR HEAD UP SO PET SHE!!!!.... plz
He seems more like a Yamcha, not much of a fighter, more of a lover.
Looking directly into the camera too. Enjoy all the good times with your new friend.
May Goku guide your hand!
I, too, have a beautiful brown tabby named Goku! He's the best boy. Give him all the chin scritches!
As a fan of dragon ball can he go super saiyan yet
Such a cutie pie
u/savevideo
I know someone who called their son Goku
My reader can't  be right...his cuteness level...IS OVER 9000!!!1!
What an expressive little grumpy face. You're a lucky dude. I have the opposite issue, I'm a cat guy but my partner hates them and her mum is allergic, so no cats for me. At least it all balances out!
I had my cat Dusty for 16 years as a kid. He was my bud. My wife is allergic now, so no cats for us. Have a Havanese now who is also my buddy.
Goku looks like he's there just to look for a good fight
That jet engine ps4 is about to take off in a few lol.
Catmecatmeha
I know it's the camera but the reverse controller is trippy.
Cats know how to suck up to people. I been living with cats all my life and nothing does cute better than a cat.
Is your cat telling you to play the game?
fuck, why didn't I name my cats after anime characters?

guess I gotta go adopt another...
Goku is awesome!  Cats rule!
What a sweetie! I had to convince my boyfriend we were getting a cat, and of course the cat is now more obsessed with him than me. It's the cat-way.
My cat is named Goku and he does this with me as well!
Hi
He's a dream ! How. Could. You. Not. ?.  Haha
Zomg. My best buddy (a male siamese seal point) was given the name goku. I thought he needed a fitting Asian name. Best cat ever. I miss him. Lost him 5 yrs ago.
My cat George does the same thing
Every time you find where he's made a mess of things or broken something you can now shout *Kakarot!*.
Most people I’ve met who don’t like cats haven’t been exposed to a friendly cat if any cat and therefore don’t have our brain parasites yet
I have the same controller
You put down that damn controller and love that boy.
Obviously you got to name him xD
What the heck looks exactly same as our cat and he does exactly same
The fact that you named your cat after a legend is just well...legendary.
😻
u/savevideo
I said the same thing until my grandma passed and I took in her cat. Now she is my best friend ever.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
What are you giving her to stay there , a cat won't keep her there surely
Goku still had his tail. Be careful around full moons
What's better than having a cat?: having a cat who likes gaming.  :3
Shitty name, but wholesome story
What a cutie!
she held you to your promise, you kept your promise. gj.
Aaaaaahw
his power is over 9000
nice gaming partner
That is pure adoration.
I did not choose r/casthostage life. 

r/cathostage life chose me.
Goku is a beautiful beastie and you are a lucky man.  Cats like Goku know good people when they meet them.
He’s soo cute
Same here dude lol
That little furry baby seems like truly and deeply in love with you.
Cats are the best! 😸
I wasn’t a cat person until we got ours. My only requirement was that it’d be a cat that hung out outside. I didn’t want a litter box and I still don’t. He’s my new gardening buddy. No joke, I won’t see him around anywhere, but within about a minute of me sitting down to tend to the plants he’ll just show up. Hangs out the whole time and watches me. Sometimes I use the strawberry runners as a toy and play with him. Cats are cool.
True love
Omg that is such a sweet kitty friend!!
My little guy likes to snuggle like this when I go to bed. Have to lay my arm out like I'm spooning my wife and he curls up just like that.
He/she is vibing 😎
almost as good as a dog, congrats.
Cats are such assholes .... I love them
This makes me so angry. Non cat people getting cat affection 😂
Enjoy the cat love, you lucky bastard
Can you post a video of him ascending to super Saiyan 3?
My heart is *melting* 🥺
Power level = FLUFF?
He is such a sweetheart!😻
That's beautiful!
I would totally be a cat person, if my immune system didn't try killing me every time I'm in the same room as one.
I was never anti-cat necessarily but I definitely wanted a dog more. First we took in a kitten my wife's coworker got but couldn't keep with his 3 dogs, thing lived in constant fear. Then we took in one from my coworker who found it on the street but couldn't keep it because of allergies. 

What's kind of funny is they ended up opposites, her coworker's cat ended up being mine and mine her's. 

The dog will still happen but not until we're in a house.
You are now owned by a cat, congrats! Wishing you two many years of love :)
So cute! May the force be with him
Awwww what a lover💕
goku, cmon man, did you even try
I know my bf is gonna get me one too after I move and is gonna be like "SURPRISE"
What is this species or type of cat called?
Aww Goku is adorable 😁
Cats have a way of finding the person who isn’t a cat person and they want to be friends with them.
Purr level over 9k!!!
That is one extremely adorable cat
Le Pro MLG Cat Gamer
Holy cuteness Batman!
Goku? Man he must eat a lot of food.
Yeah it’s pretty tough to not want a cat once they’re all curled up in your arms 😹
What a sweet little love sponge!!
Goku the Gamer
Awww.

Much like you, I was never a cat person until about 11 years a stray wandered into my (then) gfs house and changed my outlook. Little fur all named Simba. I have my cat now and he kicks ass, but Simba was my boy.

Enjoy the feline, friend. They're amazing like dogs, but in the meow way!
one of the few thing that actually nade me say aww
Serious looking lap biscuit.
That kitty loves you
“Kakarot! You cat!”
i’m inspired to name my dog Vegeta if I get one in thr future
cats chose you
you two are a perfect fit🥲
Ahhh was meant to be
I wish my cat would snuggle me like that!
Cats always love on the ones who never wanted them. Cats always want what they can’t have.
Looks like the cat is more obsessed with you than your girlfriend!
Dahhhh beanzzzz
This is wholesome AF. cute cat, op.
A cat picks you, they are a good judge of character
I love his name! I have a kitty named Bulma!
His cuteness level is over 9000
IS THAT A PS5?!?
He really loves you no doubt!
MA BOI GOKU
“hey video game human it is snuggles time. is ok, we can snuggle while u play 🎮🐱❤️“
