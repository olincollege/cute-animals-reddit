Instead of giving you gold I donated the money to your shelter.

Edit: Stop giving me silver and spend your money on a charity or invest it.

Pet.The.Cat
What are you wearing and where can it be ordered? That’s looks comfy!
I see you Ace Ventura..
Same thing happens at the daycare I work at.

Somehow the innocent just sense that you are at rest and want to share that with you.  Seriously there is nothing like sitting down to take a breather and having five or six little children crawl on your lap to hug and play with your hair.  No rules, no expectations.

Then I go home and two dogs and six cats do the same thing.

It's a semi charmed kinda life, baby
The puppers aren't surprising, but the fact that there's 5 or 6 separate *cats* that all join him on that bench is truly a sign that he is a good person. Cats have standards beyond anything.
That's an animal shelter?  I have a decent suburban home, but it would be a total downgrade for any animal from there.  Why would anyone want to be adopted out of there?
Dude I felt the depression leaving as each pet approached you, that was wholesome af
I want to go to there.
I imagine heaven is probably like that...
I would be happy there or just in Morocco.... I'm tired of living life the way society forces me to, I just want to start new
Reminds of this [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgoHJS9csHE) in ace ventura movie
I have decided I need to take a break there. More like a sabbatical. Yes. I need this is my life. 🥰

Please pet the kitties
Don't forget about the kittiez !
HEY WAIT THIS GUYS GIVING OUT PETTIN’S!!!! SWARM SWARM SWARM
Don’t forget to pat the kitties!!
This man is now the love of my life!
I think your worst work days would be better than my best ones.  

They love you. Animals are usually good judges of character. 

💜
This is how I want to die.
❤❤❤❤
Thank you. I needed to see this.
You need extra hands
And that's how we found a cure for depression
Saint Francis of Assisi, is that you?
Most convincing recommendation of a person I've ever seen. You cant buy that kind of love and trust. Clearly you're a good person!

Do you give them treats? Can we send treats?
Real life Ace Ventura
This is why I want to spend my life saving on making unwated animal shelter.   I want to take all the unwanted animals that's on their last adaption chance(im pretty sure that's a thing)    I am working very hard.  And no kids.   So it's possible.
Where is this and how can i apply for this job?
Pure Bliss.
One of us. One of us. One of us.
IIIIIIIIII am in the wrong line of work.
I think this is called animal magnetism.
I would pay to work there
I got so many endorphins just from watching this. Living the dream my dude
I want to go to there
Lol the white cat that jumps out of nowhere #FOMO
I want to be there....
They are loved so you get love as well. Win win.
This is the best video on the entire internet ever
It's beautiful
I've looked at it for 5 hours now.
“Come to me my jungle friends”
As a dog guy I love the way the cats come as well for some affection. I do like cats too, tho they’re crazy guys
I am from Morocco and I can confirm that animals are pretty much beloved by every single person, we do our best to keep them safe because we got this attitude from our culture and ancestors.
Too cute! I love how the kitties are not afraid of the dogs and come over to cuddle. Adorable.
Animals are so full of love. 🥺 thank you for this
Real life disney princess. Amazing ❤
This is the opposite of a problem
Look it’s Snow White ova here
“We are all your friends”
This guy looks like he's living the life dude. Super cool and comfy looking shirt this, super sweet animals giving him loads of love.

That looks awesome!
"Cats and dogs living together! Mass hysteria!"
This is the most amazing post I have seen in last few months !!! Thank you
❤️❤️
Heaven.
Nope OP, I think it's just you. You are the animal whisperer. 

This is such a wholesome and charming video. It reminds me of the way animals behave around my partner...they love him and flock to him.
You could pay for the entire rescue centre by offering this as therapy. I'll be your first, second, third through 1,000,000th customer
PET THE CAT TOO
My cat smacked me in the face today after I offered him a snack. He then proceeded to eat the snack that I dropped when he hit me.
Who is this guy Even Almighty?
Bless you for the lives you save and the love you share. I don't know your connections and you're probably already aware of it but there are areas in the US that are struggling to find dogs to adopt.
This is the happiest thing I’ve ever seen
I would never leave.
So happy people like you exist in the world. Angel on earth 😇😇😇😇
Is this Shamballa? Looks like heaven to me!
Dog: "Fill the pool, please."
This is my version of heaven.
You’re a good person
I love how the German shepherd is just nibbling at him the entire time
Where do I send money?
Sir, you spelled Heaven incorrectly.
I’m ready, bring me home
That has to be the best feeling in the world.
How do you get anything done
Why would you ever go home?  You're doing a yeoman's work mate!
Looks like Heaven to me.
I hope to open a shelter when I retire, I want this to be my life!
Heaven on earth is what that is.
It’s like going to heaven without having to stroke out first.
What kind of sweater shirt hoodie thing is he wearing? It's pretty slick!
You’re a sunshine 🥰
A living St. Francis
Thank you for what you do , I’m sure the animals are very appreciative and love having a place to call home
I work at the vet and only receive about 1/2 as much love. Most of them are pretty suspicious
Ace Ventura
A small slice of heaven.

This is probably the single most r/aww thing I have seen on this Sub.

Especially that spotted cat rubbing on bro there. Poor thing needs attention and wasn't getting any. 😢
Your face as you pit the camera up screams sweet loving man. Those animals can smell your hugs a mile away. You are awesome! Good job.
That is amazing and adorable and it makes me
Happy.

Bro I think you are a Disney Princess now
You have a new reoccurring donation. Keep taking care of the animals and giving them their best life!

I wish i had breaks like that
This is the life I live and long for <3
Are you hiring?
I'd come and take several seats for several hours for several weeks.
u/savevideobot
Real talk, I'd pay good money to just be surrounded by lovable pets for a while. Going through some real dark times lately. I got friends helping me through, but this would be so killer on top of that.

Soo much love and affection...
Thing's I'd die for.
Well I've decided what job I'm getting now

Something about animals man. Idk how people do them dirty? They’re all about love...& good times...& food 🤪
That would be my favorite work in the whole wide world if I just didn't have allergies.    Please find a cure to allergies, I love animals. <3
This is my favourite post on Reddit ever

That looks like a good problem to have! ❤️
This is so wholesome it's making me rethink my corporate life
I need to work here 😍
Just get more pets, i have 5 cats and 2 dogs so this happens at home. Lol
Of course the one animal who couldn't care less about your break is a CAT.
My depression would vanish!! Where can I find a place like this?
Only downside is you don't have infinite time to spend all the quality time they all deserve 😭😭😭.
They think he has food. Pretty sure that's all that's going on here.
Looks like they need more attention
Even the cats

I'd say that 's about as close to heaven that you could find on earth.
The way the cat in the background by the door immediately gets up and hurries over.. <3
So much pets. Must be a lovely experience.
Gotta pet 'em all!
Makes me cry tears of joy

What do you mean break? Caring for animals is a vacation as a job.
My favorite is under bed cat.  He is cool with just getting in some play.
Oh! Can I just sit here everyday? Moving to Morocco!
Talk about living the dream
My dream job.
Huh… Heaven
No pets for the kits? Aww poor babies. Also, i wish i live in Morocco.
It might be because you are wearing their bedclothes
It's like Snow White except with cats and dogs!
Awww that’s amazing
I would pay 15 for entrance into that place, and I would go one a month.
I would never get any work done .
My asthma says no. Cute dogs though.
You can tell this man is truly loving towards these animals, they all adore him!
This is what I hope heaven is like
i see this as an absolute win
I can think of worse fates.

rescuethony animaltano here, i give this a light 7 solid 8
That’s wonderful
I’m in Dallas can someone pick me up?

You are living my dream
More importantly I'd say is that man has so much love for those animals. They wouldn't come if they didn't know he loves them all back.
Can I help out there... I’ll just take breaks all day
That looks like heaven! 😍
Ya i need this in my life.
Nice jalabah bro!

Ughghghg!!! Me want!! Yes 🙌
Best break ever!!

My god, I’m in the wrong career..
I thought the title said "try to break into" the animal shelter. That would have been a crime I'd hate but need to refuse ;-;
Poor white cat didn't get any pets.
Dude your Snow White!
Sitting means cuddle time.
Treats in those robes ?   Kidding....so wholesome thank you
Bless you good sir!

The saddest part of this video is that he only has 2 hands
I SEE KITTIES TOO
Yeah I would be ok with this.
Did you screen record while looking at the camera app? Why not just record a video?
Then there's that little gray dog that has a person RIGHT THERE and doesn't give a single damn.
Where is this and how did you nab the greatest job on earth?
Some kind of animal whisperer you are haha
Best.Job.Ever
That cat is like, "you're. going. to. take. this. love. whether. you. like. it. or. NOT!"

Ugh. I hate myself for judging the initial appearance of this man. I need to be a better person.

Is this man a Disney princess?
Don't let Mr. Shickadance find out.
He's a Disney Prince
Absolutely amazing, this is my dream. One day!
You're like Snow White
The animals have radars that tell them when one of staff are on breaks
I like that one cat in the back just slinking away 😆
So much better than a smoke break.
I thought the beginning was a green screen
Touch the cats! Don't forget about the cats!!

I want to live here.
I also work in rescue and this is 100% accurate

Don’t neglect the kitties 🥺😤
Looking for help?  Where about is this Shangri-La ?
What is my guy wearing? What is it called? It looks handcrafted by some little sweet lady who also makes the best tortillas in town..I guess that just might just be due to the setting of this video. Anyway, how can I get one of those if not?

That is definitely heaven.
Odd... Same thing happens with my co-workers when it's time for my break.
I fwel with a fishbowl helment he could comfortably lay down and commit his hands to petting them better
Are you a monk, or is that robe meant to keep all the loose fur from getting on your regular clothes underneath?
Welp, now i gotta put on Ace Ventura : Pet Detective again...tHaNkS AlOt

Cats even got jealous when she saw you playing with the dog.
May his memory be a blessing

Thats so cute!
Is that robe basically just used when you enter the rescue center as to avoid messing up your regular clothes? 

Or is that regular clothing?
DrDoolittle. That’s great
Ahhhh so cute💖
Cute💖💖
Did my eyes deceive me, or was there a ring-tailed Lemur in that group?
WHAT HEAVEN!
Look at all those loving animals that just want to love a human. 

Thank you for being a great person and giving them love and care until they find their forever homes.
This reminds me of Ace Ventura when all his pets come to him when gets home!
