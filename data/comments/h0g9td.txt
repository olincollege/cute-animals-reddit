How do cats get that fat? Seriously asking. Is it always an irresponsible owner or are there sometimes underlying medical conditions?
I cant imagine how you got him so skinny. Its not like you can walk a cat. Thats awesome though. I just have images of my cat when i put him on a leash to walk, he lumpped down and didnt move.
That's awesome! It must be so much easier on his joints.

I have a cat who was overweight and it was causing arthritis - he was in pain, cranky, and sluggish. Now that he's thinner, he's happier and he plays like a kitten again - and he's 9.

Congrats on helping your kitty get healthier!

What's wrong with transformation pics?
dechonked.
This is like the before and after for me!

Except left side is after =.=
reverse the order of the pictures, and post it on r/chonkers and get thousands of upvotes.
good to know you take care of your cat! keep it up
Wow! What a change! I could do with a diet like that!
Wow! I'd certainly like to know his regimen! Got a chonker I need to slim down, myself. We're already doing reduced diets, diet food, active play time... But he's not going down.
I,too, have a chonk. She steals food from my younger kitty. So they are now on a strict regimen. She's losing weight, and my Itty-bitty is growing nicely.
Is that cinderblock? Best cat name ever btw.

Well at least they're the right way around for a change.
I wish my dad would do this with the dog. Instead he feeds him chicken nuggets from McDonald's.
good
How much did this cat hate you during the process?
Sustained.
schnoodle at first lmao
From a chunk to a hunk.
Schnoodles and sprogs sound like some Dr. Seuss shit

He is now an acceptable chonker, this is epic
getting an indoor cat to lose weight is no easy task.  congratulations.  and good for you for doing the work instead of just being like "lOoK aT mY cHoNkEr!!!1"
He looks happier
Yo, is that Cinderblock?
Unless I'm blind , these cats have different color eyes.
And the white hair patterns on the face dont match.but damn everything else is spot on.
He escaped from r/chonkers
My cat lived through the same transformation. Now whenever she runs the "leftover" skin on her belly swings left and right which looks really funny.

There's still some extra fur leftovers
Wow. That's amazing!
Even looks more youthful - wow! I am sure you have years to his/her life. Amazing transformation!
Yes!! Way to go chubbiest!

This shows hardwork and dedication. All need to learn from this cat.

Harvesting the gains..
This cat has more diet commitment than me
Cuteeeee
It is like  if mac were a cat.
Wow, amazing! Any tips? Currently have been trying to diet my previously feral tabby. When he stretches he‚Äôs about 3.5 ish feet and last I checked 24 pounds. Current goal is for him to have a visible neck again.
WOW! So beautiful!
How? My cat has been 20lbs for years
Your cat looks great! Any advice on how you did it? Looking for some help for my own chunky cat.
Is that really the same cat? Cleans up wellü§¥
That is **awesome**!
I love that you can see his extra skin on his chest!  His legs and feet look like they're much more comfortable.  Sweetheart!
Excellent. I'm sure it wasn't easy. But what a transformation. Good job all around
He was a chonky boi.
Is that Cinderblock?
Our Ashby is 18#  vet says he‚Äôs ‚Äúbig boned ‚Äú good for you and your beautiful grey üòªüòª

DAMMM BOI THATS A THICC ASS BOY
So you got a new cat?
I don't know if I'm too sensible today or what but this pic made me cry a bit.

I had to leave the country for 3 months and my cat stayed with my uncle. When I got my cat back he had 6 more kilos, being now 11.
I couldn't believe how fat and slow he looked. Now he has lost some weight but it seems he won't loose any more kilos.
I hope my cat also looses weight. He has a special diet food but he is always hungry and doesn't admit only eating the recommended amount
Thought "nah, that's 2 similar looking cats", but nope the markings are identical. Amazing.
r/dechonkers
Big Chonkus
I have been trying for a very long time to get my cats to slim down. They're not grossly overweight, but they are a little chonky. I have tried so hard to ration their food, cutting back little by little, but they just do not lose any weight. :( They're not extremely active, but they do run and play occasionally, so they're not total potatoes. I wish I could figure out how to help them lose weight.
Keto?
looks angry in both pics
What‚Äôs his/her name
This is kinda like Ethan in sidemen
Body snatched, ready for Corona summer!!
I bet that was one Kranky Kitty while you restricted their food.  *meeeeewww* *meeeeewww* *scratch dig scratch dig*
Woo
This is exactly what I Want for my cat! From right to left of course
What a beautiful cat <3
But there's nothing wrong with transformation poctures
His foot placement changed
oMG so CuTE ChOnKER HECKIN
interesting how everyone assumes it‚Äôs a male, hmmm
Is this the same chonk I just saw scratching at his ass and sniffing it?
Chonk
Glad to see her tank top finally fits.
If you flip the pictures, it's a cat that gets swole for revenge
As a vet tech who has seen their share of chonkers, bless you, for you are truly a wonderful, loving pet parent. He makes such a handsome slenderboi!
I like how  she/he is wearing the same tank top.
His gray coat fits much better now.
When we adopted Big Daddy, he was 17 lbs. The vet came in to talk to us (while the tech had him in the hallway). Without seeing him, he started to talk to us about taking off his extra weight. When they brought him in, the doctor understood why we started to laugh. He was underweight. He was the longest cat I had ever seen. He regularly stretched to touch my  6'4" husband's stomach. Our big boy was healthiest at around 20 lbs.
That was a big cat
Isn't this from a BoredPanda post?
Adorbs!!
Plot twist: before pic is on the right
I love both of them
Holy fat
This cat is literally goals. Fitspo forever kitty meow!

Still appreciate the chonker
kitty ate salad, now looking terrific
What a handsome and fluffy boi
Weight loss queen
This is so adorable. I'm crying at how cute this cat is both ways. It's cute on one side, and cute on the other, anyway, it lost weight and now it's closer to becoming a floof.
No way my cat would be the opposite! I love cats!
How do cats loose weight? Cus they don‚Äôt really go on walks or get exercise so I always wondered how cats loose weight, being they sleep and eat all day...... lol I‚Äôm seriously curious tho

That is awesome!!!!!!
That's some weight loss, congrats cheety cat.
What a handsome cat
incredible, how mad was teh kitty when you started teh diet?
Traded your bulldog for a cat???
Oh so very nice thank you
What a fine boy!

He de-chonked very well!
please PLEASE share how this was done? My baby is a serious chonk and it makes me so sad looking at her :/ I‚Äôve tried everything diet wise and when i try getting her to play she just sits there. I would hate for anything to happen, and she begs so damn neurotically for food and my heart breaks. 

this is SO inspiring.
Cats are obligate carnivores. That's all.
Mad
How to look at this photo? From right to left?
It‚Äôs reversed
How?? My baby is not that fat but he‚Äôs getting there.
/r/intermittentfasting kitty version
Wow. How‚Äôs you do it? My cat isn‚Äôt super chonk, but he is more plumps than he should be. He needs to lose 1.5-2lbs.

The diet food was working for about a year, now he‚Äôs gained the weight back.

I have caught him with his paw in the cookie jar, but I moved all the food into the garage. 

He doesn‚Äôt seem to go crazy with the foods, but I am worried about the potential for him & diabetes.
Not chonker not wholesome 100
I think one thing a lot of cat owners don‚Äôt do is measure out their cat‚Äôs food! Weigh your cat and then follow the food plan for your cats weight. My cat gets 55g of dry food per day rather than free access to a bowl.
Big chungus
Is it before ‚Äî> after or

before <‚Äî after?!

But seriously: That‚Äôs amazing
Such a chonky boi.
The best part is his toes going from pointing inward to outward

And a new dye job too.
What cute unchunk boy
What a beauty.Face gains!
Does he have a floppy belly now? My cat does since she lost a lot of weight.
Awwww!  Congrats!
Bravo! I work in the vet field and I know how hard it can be to get kitties to loose weight! I even made a "fat cat" handout for my clients that has tips and tricks for weight loss! I'm sure he feels all sorts spry now with the weight off!!! And hes super cute to boot!
**C H U N K Y**

Please share your secrets. I have a chonker whom I have tried everything with. He is in love with the food.

His front legs look so happy after weight loss.

Looks like she is day dreaming about butter.

Wow. Thank you for helping kitty get healthier. That's a longterm project.
The haunted stare didn‚Äôt change.
Doctors love him learn how he lost weight
Only live so if you can resist it
Idk...fat kitty actually looks MORE confident than thin kitty.

How? I have 3 cats. One is a very obese abyssinian. I feed them separately and at regular times. She is still a fancy chonk.
If this cat can do it, you can do it. :)
r/dechonkers for the win!
Beautiful cat! Ok so, my cat doesn't need quite as big of a transformation, but seriously how do I get one of my cats on a diet while feeding the other normally? Without them eating my arm haha!
Before is more of an absolute unit tho
Can you please elaborate on what you fed him, how you managed to get him to loose the weight, I am sure it may help many of us.
yay it's a fit kitty now :D
Bro! How did you do it? Was it cardio and intermittent fasting? Please tell us.
Wonder if you would find a lot of excess skin if you shaved this cat.
He hit the gym forsure üòÖ

Bro, I'll bet the cat on the right doesn't even lift!
Did he go on the Keto diet?

I‚Äôll never understand how people let their animals get that overweight.

Kitty gluttony, my personal sin

Just when I thought I hit-a-wall, 

Alas, a hemp string, I saw it fall.

Canter, snatch, trot around it 

Daily done it to stay fit.

My dog weighs 8 lbs and is very picky. I‚Äôd love to fatten him up a bit so his ribs don‚Äôt show, but he isn‚Äôt interested. Doesn‚Äôt like dog treats. Hard to train a dog when no reward is enticing enough. The vet said he is okay. But I worry...

How is no-one commenting on the fact that if your cat is fat, you are feeding it crap. Feed species appropriate food. A cat that fat gets carbohydrate and eats because it is starved of nutrition. Pathetic.
