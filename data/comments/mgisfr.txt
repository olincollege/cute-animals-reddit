Awww! Ribbity rabbity roll, get the fuck out of our hole!

That's cute and all... BUT WHY IN GODS NAME DID YOU PUT YOUR HAND DOWN A RANDOM HOLE???
Tina, do you just go around looking in random holes?
Unfortunately this post reminded me of Watership Down. Lasting trauma.

These rabbits are going to be booted out of the colony because they won't stop telling stories about their alien encounter. "There was a bright light at the mouth of the cave.... then suddenly it flew straight up without a sound!"
You got a verbal ‚Äúoh my GOD‚Äù from me. 10/10 cutest bunnies.
I have a hole like this in my spring garden. I haven't seen them but they keep eating my Crocus leaves down to nubs. I ain't even mad.
Hello new phone, who dis?
Thought it was a rat for a second! Glad it wasn't, they're adorable!
‚ÄúHon, there‚Äôs someone at the door, can you go get it?‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh alright let me put my pants on...
May I help you good sir?‚Äù

My wife did this in a fox hole and she dropped her Galaxy S10 which slid down into the abyss. We bought a big magnet and put it on a big stick and went fishing down in the hole to no avail. Every day we pass by hoping it decided to tidy out its den but for now its the most technologically advanced fox in the area
One time I saw the head of a snake under some lumbar. I ran to my dad to tell him and when he went to see it all we saw was a tiny bunny hop out. It was so small I thought it was a snake head lol.
Oh my gosh! Hi little fluffers!!

Am I the only guy who in a much less manly voice than I wish exclaim "bunnies!" when they appeared?
Nice

Phew, was expecting a giant spider to come charging out.
Probably really busy getting ready for Easter.
Ahh the real Easter bunny
You really went down the rabbit hole.

Isn't it great when nature invades your home... remember when you see those animals running across your floor that they just want to point a camera at you and there is no need to attack them
Awwww so cute
Keep that hole safe
I bet it's warm and cozy in there! :)
Fuck. Do not do this in Australia.
Awwww
Always keep the holy grenade near by just in case.
The primal fear of living in Australia makes me immediately expect a Trap-door spider or a funnel web spider or any kind of snake. Even though there are clearly no webs present, I still feel the need to run.

Don‚Äôt give the Farmer his fun fun fun

OMG Bunnies!!!  Run for your lives!!!  Retreat!!!  Well maybe they will keep the lawn mowed so you don't have to work so hard this summer???
Down the rabbit hole can be a fun place to go.
i was half expecting a blackbird or smth lmao
LET THEM STAY
what if its a snake
Omg!! Just recently my dog was sniffing around the backyard like a bloodhound. I was standing next to him trying to get him to come inside and a bunny jumped out of the grass onto my foot and took off.

He ran a few yards and then stopped. I picked him up and held him for a couple minutes, then put him under some cover by the spot he came from. 

It was so goddamn cute and I didn't want to stop holding him but knew I had to. Such an awesome experience holding a baby wild bunny

We get rabbits hiding their babies in our lawn all the time. 

Our German shepherd thinks they are food and/or toys and kills them ASAP. 

I found out when my sister heard something outside and said ‚ÄúDoes she like her toys outside like that?‚Äù  And I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she has any...oh my god...‚Äù

She was killing a baby rabbit.

This is so cuteee.....baby bunnies with wiggly nosies make me feel happy. Thank you OP for uploading this.
Bun Buns!
Aww I saw the same hole in my park. Fucking cute big rat came out. Almost crap my pants.
So how do you feel about them in real life?
‚ÄúHey, buddy, can you point me the way to CHATT...anooga?
What kind of maniac sees a whole and says hol up I'll put my phone in it
At least it wasn't rats!
Share this with r/rabbits!
Holy fucker, I didn't look at the sub before the video and was sure this was someone being funny in r/nope by calling giant fucking spiders or snakes "cuties" and was waiting for the jump scare ...

I'm so glad I was wrong
The other little one was like "fool that ain't momma". üòÇ
My heart melted
How do they manage to stay so clean looking while in a tunnel of dirt? V cool, thx for sharing(:
Bunny sees something strange at the entrance to its home so it sticks its head out. No wonder why they are nature's popcorn.
Awww! So sweet!
What if someone filled in the hole?
hello!!!! it‚Äôs spring!!!!!
That's the cutest fucking thing i've ever seen in my entire life!
Thats cute
Bunny's so cute.
Baby bunnies!
Plotting to take the farmer's heart in revenge, I'd bet.
Bunnies!!!!
Sticking your phone down random holes seems like a generally bad idea..

On the off-chance that its not a rabid animal living down there but a cute one, it can still snatch your phone away and run off with it
U burried them allive !?
Look at the bones!
"Nooo, i do not have any more honey for you Pooh"

Bun bun!!
My first thought was: who puts their phone down a hole?

Easter is coming. Did you drop some Cadbury eggs down there?
Down the rabbit hole we go.

good use of the camera
Last year we had baby bunnies burrowing under our house but we had coincidentally got a puppy 

It wasn‚Äôt very nice cleaning it up
u/savevideo
No wonder rabbits have a "spray and pray" reproduction strategy when their first instinct at seeing a stranger at the burrow is to walk out to investigate.
Imagine if you'd dropped it
WoW! Seems cooler then other.
*dies of cute*

Also, I'm glad to know rabbits tunnel.  We have a few in our yard and I worry about them getting snatched by hawks.
Did you talk to them about our Lord and Savior Bugs?
Well, I‚Äôd just like to say the baby rabbits are adorable. Looks like mom picked a safe place. I‚Äôve read rabbit needs can be run over by lawnmowers if not underground.
Quellish
Often when you see these animal burrows they appear to go pretty deep. Is it pitch black generally in the dens? Can the animals see at all with better visual acuity/night vision or do they just accept it's going to be black.   


I first starting thinking this from that owl burrow video a few days ago where it looked like the burrows were so long no light at all would make it. I know you can see the bunny a bit at the start so that might not be the case here, but is there a general trend?
Lil homie chilling
I thought it was an alligator at first
I thought this was an ear wax video.

In a hole in the ground there lived ~~a Hobbit~~ baby bunnies. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a ~~hobbit-hole~~ bunny-hole, and that means comfort. 

Still, so cute. :)
