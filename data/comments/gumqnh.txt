The superman pose to ensure all the arms and legs get the sun too is hilarious. Have to ensure an even bake!

Downward facing dog?
Dogs basking in the sun is the cutest and most wholesome thing ever!
Every 15-30 minutes, you should’ve taken a picture the movement of the sunlight, a timelapse where you watch doggo reposition.

It sometimes becomes a morning routine.
This is beautiful.
i lost my chihuahua back in november and he used to do this all the time. he was small so he could fit into the smallest of sun spots. ANYTHING to be warm and cozy. this picture really made me smile. thank you for posting this
Everyone should try this atleast once
Your dog is art
I though there was a hole in your floor for a second.
Sun dog!
Look! It's an angel!

Smart dog know where the good spot is
Must’ve paid a little extra for that solar powered pup.
Ascend to the dog
That´s very Mr. Bean of him
I thought that was a bat
Doggo’s going through the light portal
My dachshund does this with the sun spot though our kitchen door. But as the morning goes on and the spot moves, we have to move his bed into the sun for him.
Did he shuffle when the sun moved?

Ah yes, the “Downward Dog” yoga pose...
So cute!  And looks *exactly* like ours: [https://i.imgur.com/qc3aDBU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/qc3aDBU.jpg)

Ours is a beagle/min-pin mix - so gets confused for a dachshund all the time!

My dog does that too and follows it throughout out the day. Then when it starts to go up the wall she tries to claw it down
So smart.     So peaceful!!
And the perfect sploot!
That dog deserves a treat.
At my house we just say "Sun Dog" whenever we see this happen with our girls.
Great photo, thank you!
The holy doggo
My dumb self looked at the dog's body and thought it was a hole in the floor
He don’t miss sunlight...
My grandma’s dog does this too, same kind of dog haha, absolutely adorable
this image is the embodiment of satisfaction
I Love that baby with all my heart ❤️
I love when they smell like sun puppy after :)
How to cook a hot dog
He has been sent down by God to bring joy and laughter
someone stop the sun from spinning so he can stay in that spot all day
I live in a very hot and humid tropical country and my neighbor’s dog still like to hang out under direct sunlight. Why is that?
Sigh it’s even perfectly in the middle
This looks just a like my dog
Doggo taught us to make the best use of what we have got.
long boi
Awwww
Even god knows the rule "do not move and wake your pets up".
Boy, I’ll say. Hope your dog doesn’t get any bigger! 😂

...until the cat shows up...😼😽
The holy doggo
oh, to be a dachshund sun bathing in a perfectly-sized spot on the floor.
Amazing
Love the perfect fit in the spot.
That looks great but I can think a few better ways to cook that dog
My Dachshund does this all the time - if he’s quiet (rare) than he is either chewing something or sleeping in a patch of sun
Smart dog. Knows the importance of getting some good  astral sun energy
aww precious, my old dog used to do the same thing  ❤️
The perfect rectangle
Nice!🔥
My dog does the exact same thing. My window faces the East so every morning she lays in front of it, soaking up the suns rays.

This makes me miss my dachshund. She loved the sun and always was laying in front of our sliding glass doors. She must have just liked heat in general because she used to lay right up against our coal stove too. Those were the days. She hated me when I was a kid, but I loved her.
I hate dogs but i love this
this dog has a quest for me
Love me a good sploot on a dog. My own dog is famous for them around my house.
Hot dog roasting in the sun ☀️ 😍
What a cute hot dog!

Does he have a quest for me?
And the perfect sploot! 🙂
I love the way my dog smells after sun bathing.
How does the sun know to shine exactly on the dog?
Me after running a Zoom meeting with 20 people
I think your dog has a quest for you
Cute.  I did a double take though because it nearly looks like my Dachshund.
Our two dogs and cat are always lackadaisically fighting over the skylight spot. It's pretty funny. Maybe someday I can get it on camera.
The is a life lesson photo. We need to surround ourselves with people, books, and places that let us rest in joy, peace, and brightness.
He must be really warm.
Aww!
Soon the sun gods will carry him forth to there domain
What a cute Hot Doggo!
I love this with all my heart
My introverted self when I need my dose of vitamin D
Actually scratch that he manifested there in the sun the sun is merely what spawned him
Anyone know why lets do this? My cats do this even though they have access to the outside?

Are they cold?
Perfect sp(LO)ot
Awwww!
haha, cute
I love those rear drumstick legs.
Warm weiner.
This is a spoilt poochie poochie living his best life.
We call that “the frog butt” in my house. Sooo cuuuute
looks like a joint
That doggo looks like it got a really interesting side quest for ya
It looks like he's on a little yoga mat.
I like to think that he just scoots over whenever he notices the light has moved. So cute!
as a guy with massive OCD, this makes me happy
I need him in my life
Such a dachshund thing to do. Ours follows the sun spot from the floor during the day until he is quite literally lying half on the floor/wall when it’s moved so far in the evening.

He DEFINITLY has a quest for you

I like to imagine that he rolls on his side and then to his back as the sun moves away from that perfect spot.
“Get along little doggie.”
obviously training for when he works for Mr. freeze
This is how I envision a tanning salon in a dog's world to be
I love him
My dog does this!! Tbh its all he does. They're the same breed as mine too
Literally thought that was dabs
I was so sure this was a joint before being rolled.
My dog does the same.

But he's lazy as fuck, so when the light moves I have to push him back in the sun.
The perfect sploot.
can dogs get sunburns
He sure knows how to enjoy life

Our dog would chase sunspots around the house all day, dang,  I miss her.
This dog is so weird! haha! So cute in a way. It really filled the whole spot of the sunlight. :D

Perfect spot, my cat went in my mr shadow the other day it was so hot but he couldn't move

I love this. My oldest dog follows the kitchen light too which just happens to land on some of the floor anti-fatigue matts. Super comfy and warm for him. He's the only dog i dont yell at to get out the kitchen. The younger ones really just want scraps. My old guy deserves some sun lounging when we're not outside.
I think you burnt your weenie a little
Perfect!

Everything outside the light is lava

I used to think my dog was stupid coz he would always lie down where the sun hits, instead of moving a little bit to the right or left to avoid it. Apparently they like the sun.
That is an awesome dachshund!
Looks like an unrolled joint .
He a long boi!
In the future when even our dogs have glow yoga mats.
There is no window, the dog just eminates sunlight around it
The chosen pooch
Stop being so perfect....
This one has its light in order
I had several dachshunds growing up and most of them loved to do this. I guess it's just a common thing for the breed. 

One of my dogs in particular, Pixie, would lay flat on her back with her stubby little legs sprawled out so she could bathe her belly in the sun. My dad would always say she looked like roadkill when doing that.
get that pupper a jacket!
This dog looks like he just lost in Smash Bros Classic mode
My chiweenie does the same thing!

It looks almost custom-made. So jealous right now.

I know how that dog feels. Sometimes the air conditioning in homes is a little too low and feels kind of cool (which it should); however, sometimes you just need to feel some warmth for a bit. And this little munster is  probably doing that. Enjoy, little fella!
