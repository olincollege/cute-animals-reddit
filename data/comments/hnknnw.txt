I knew there was a day when Cats would evolve the ability to make and use tools, and it's only natural that they would then invent tools that would allow them to more efficiently feast on our souls...

(our cats won't come near us with those cones on, they blame us for whatever led to the cone wearing)
If Im in a cone, you also will be in a cone!

My bengal figured out how to take her Elizabethan-collar off within one minute of getting home. It tied and cinched together, but she still got it off. When she realised she had to wear it, she figured out how to get at her surgical site by pushing the collar back against the floor and stretching her head forward.
"Pssst, get me out of this fucking thing."

My cat is in a cone of shame right now and has gotten very creative about doing things with it on. He also keeps staring at random places on the floor which makes me wonder if he is okay or just on the lookout for ants again. He loves watching bugs. Terrible hunter. He just watches and waits for someone else to deal with it.

I was cat sitting for my in laws and their cat had recently been coned. He normally likes to wake them up in the morning by nuzzling his face against theirs and I guess he wasn‚Äôt going to let a cone or a stranger in his owner‚Äôs bed stop his routine. I woke up to a cone right in the face, with the cone amplifying and lowering the frequency of his typical good morning chirps to create a jarring and very loud noise.

I‚Äôve heard somewhere that kitties (and dogs too iirc) don‚Äôt really like cones because it blocks their peripheral vision and sorta freaks them out. maybe look into getting a clear one if the cat has to wear it for an extended length of time? 

seriousness aside though, that‚Äôs pretty funny.

Ignoring the "safety"/(speed?) holes, you can imagine both suddenly trying to breathe in and being suctioned/vacuumed together.
My brother once had a pug that got the cone after a Hernia surgery. I felt bad for him since he couldn't judge the spacings he needed with it on. He was constantly walking into chairs with it. I think the one that got me the most was when he tried getting on the couch but walked up to it with the cone against the couch. Sadly, he then started simpering because he didn't know backing up would unseal him from his head prison.
