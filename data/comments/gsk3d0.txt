"Carl, I'm beginning to think she never really went to college."
This video ended too soon. We didn’t get to see their flower pictures.
The cats sit better at the table than my toddler.
I’m surprised the cats sat through the entire thing, I can barely sit through a lecture without blacking out.
Translation from Brazilian Portuguese:

“Any questions, just ask!”
“And now, the root.” “Now, the root just like the other side”.
“Did you get it? It’s a flower”.
“Now draw”.
“Did you understand, Robert? Did you understand, John Henry?”
“Look. Did you get it? This is how you draw a flower.”
We all just gonna ignore that the cat on the right already drew the whole scene
These kitties are more attentive than most school age kids..
Oh my god, they stay there. How?
"What's the small human doing?" 

"Silence, Harold. She is talking."
All I needed to see was those cats sitting at that table looking like students. Unbelievable.
How did she get the cats to sit like that and to stay so still?
The tabby cat on the right was daydreaming but then turned back just before she saw.  That's a real student right there.  Reminds me of my days in school.
the darker cat was like:

"uhh Bob.. should we tell her?"
“Dude, do you think this will be on the test?”
My parents had a dog who had 6 puppies when I was in like 2nd grade. I wanted to train them but I had it in my head that each puppy knew a different language. The fact that I only knew English didn’t matter. My “obedience school” was literally me talking to puppies in gibberish.

Those poor puppies. This girl is a better teacher.
Why did they stop the video before the cats drew flowers? This is bullshit!
I love how the one cat looks away, then looks back just as she turns around! XD
Gray Cat: Dude, I don’t get it.

White Cat: Shhh! I’m trying to listen!
The one cat says to the other "hey, weren't we promised there would be treats at this resort demo?"
That is adorable
I love the way the cats just sit there
[deleted]
Man that's kinda cute
Ugh wish my cats would sit still at all. It’s been a challenge homeschooling them during this quarantine.
"*pssst, you wanna tell this kid we don't got thumbs?"
This is adorable
What kind of alternate universe is this. For whatever reason, this kid not only has talent drawing flowers, but nailed the shading on the ground just like that, is a more attentive teacher than many I've seen, and the cats are actually just sitting there. Taking it in.

Even worse. She put the chalk back in the box. And not somewhere random where you can't find it anymore after 30 seconds. Like a fucking psychopath.
Her hair looks so fabulous! I wish my parents took that much care of me when I was little lol
r/patientcats
Pretty good flower too
those cats are so cool just sittin there watchin
"Hey John, when are we gonna tell her we don't have opposable thumbs and thus it's impossible for us to hold or manipulate these drawing tools?"

"Nah, just chill, don't tell her, Bob. It's funnier that way."
Some folks are born to teach.
Cats just sitting there like “when’s lunch?”
I love how the cats are genuinely confused about the entire situation yet still remain in their seats and listen to her lecture.
Pretty much how I envision board meetings to be for Meow Mix.
😭😭😭😭😭
Dammit, even foreign cats are smarter than their American counterparts.  Our education system is falling behind on all fronts.
These cats are more attentive than anyone I know.
I'm glad I don't understand the language the little girl is speaking because I got to experience the video from the cats point of view.
I love how the cats just look like they're vibing
 One cat to the other: "Do you tell her we don't have opposable thumbs?"
I think the grey one is going to copy the other cat’s work.
I love how the cats are just like “Interesting Suzy, please continue.”
Okay. Who can translate what she's saying to English? Please. This is super cute.
The Siamese is plotting for the most sensitive spot on that child's body.  The tabby is wondering when the food will arrive.
The cats are just like "wtf is a draw?"
How on earth do you get cats to sit that long through something? Most cats I know would not even last 10 seconds. So wholesome.
My art teacher would routinely get high during lunch then burn popcorn in his room so nobody could smell it. He fooled nobody. Pretty sure he’s still there.
The fact that she got them to sit like that for that long is definitely an accomplishment!
Her class is so attentive
"You getting this shit?"

"No"

"Same."
I was waiting for them to start drawing

Those cats are better behaved than some students
I'm more impressed that those cats stayed... Sitting and just actually being good students... For, you know, cats.
This is Angela Martin as a kid

Change my mind
Too damn cute. I can’t wait to show my own daughter this
Those cats are just vibing
* cat raises paw* “ Can you show me a picture of a food bowl and actually food in it?”
This looks super staged. I hate to be a cynic but I find it very hard to believe cats would sit like that without training. The table looks REALLY perfectly set, too.

Not accusing OP of anything, it's still cute. It just seems like it was set up by a crew.
Having just come from r/Minneapolis I really needed this.
So...how many pills do you have to give a cat to do that?
They look like some serious students!
I love how the cats are just sitting there, they really want to learn
At like 0.41 the grey cat looked like he was looking at a clock and the white cat said “bro how long we got until lunch”
Cats: We're sorry, we thought this was the How To Purchase A Boat seminar.
Cat 1: Why are we doing this again?

Cat 2: Because we could get treats after "class".

Cat 1: Oh yeah.
Cat on the right: Dude, I ain't got no paper. Paper? Anybody? Oh, well.
Their paws on the tableeee I love itt
I’m really happy that these two cats went back to college to finish their degrees.
I am so amazed at those cats
The way they sit
Those are some of the most well-behaved students I've ever seen. A lot of us can learn proper etiquette from them.
I can’t get over the way they’re sitting 😭
Those cats have "parents dragged us to a timeshare presentation to get fake breakfast and not-that-discounted Disney World tickets" mood.
What the Zeus? How'd she get them to pay attention that long?
I swear to god those are the most patient understanding cats in the history of humanity
“Ugh buddy, remind me why we sitting here like a humans?”

“Because when she finish, we get a ton of Tuna... and I don’t wanna spends next week dressed up like toddler”

“Fair enough, give me a red pencil please”
How the hell are those cats just sitting there?
The cat on the right is like "oh god I hope there isn't going to be a test at the end of this."
Those cats are fucking stupid. Can't even draw a goddamn flower.
I love how they are so patiently sitting there and actually listening to her like they are about to follow her instructions to the letter. So freaking cute. X
The cats are there just for attendance
“We were told there would be snacks...”
how are the cats just sitting like that???? holy shit... they're so chill there lol
Given the circumstances I'm seeing I believe it is possible for cats to draw flowers
They have an Instagram :) @douglasrobertogato
The students were captivated , not a single interruption from either of them!
I can’t than you enough for sharing this.
Not being able to understand a single word she says really helps me see this drawing lesson from the cat's point of view.
I hope they scratched out some notes
I half expect the cats to actually pick up a pencil and try to draw the flower. They seem to be paying really good attention to their teacher.
Both cats are thinking, "The little fool doesn't realize we have no hands to hold the chalk."
I was half expecting those kitties to pick up pencils and begin to draw.
What have those poor cats gone through to get to the point that they'll sit like that for extended periods?
That's really cute
E os gatos prestando atenção, eu vou dormir feliz hoje. PUTA MERDA.
“Psst!  Can I copy your notes?”
Awesome
What excellent listeners!
This is adorable
At the end the teacher gave a look, "Ok which one of you just farted?"
I can totally see my daughter doing this. And the cats following her instruction
She is a good teacher, since her students paid full attention the whole time!
"Be still, fellow cat. She'll put us in the [cornfield](https://youtu.be/Aow80Vl4Xmo?t=35) like the others!"
So sweet
What well-behaved students!
I love her cattos
[deleted]
She's going to be a teacher when she grows up
The cats sitting😍
Those cats will protect her every step of her life growing up.  They get it.
Do all cats look like [This](https://www.google.com/search?q=cat+looking+at+snow+meme&oq=cat+looking+at+snow&aqs=chrome.1.0l3.5894j0j9&client=ms-android-motorola-rev2&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8) when they try to focus or is it just me?
Please post to r/siamesecats
I’m upset that I kept looking at the cats expecting them to draw
Are the cats glued to the seats?
Idk why, but I really love when cats sit like people.
Those cats are extremely patient! They must really love her.
That was just too cute
Awwwwee so cute
The cats are in their own personal "It's a Good Life."  They've tried disobeying, but Antonia has threatened to send them to the cornfield.

That cats are like "shit, we should have done the prep work"
Those cats are drugged.  Lol
Cats like these are little Angel's sent from heaven
I'm surprised one of those cats didn't pick up a pencil and start drawing
"Why are we still here? Just to suffer?"
I swear cats are secretly smarter than humans but care so less and are too lazy to take over the world.
Either those cats are the most obedient cats ever, or they are superglued to the chair.
How on earth is it possible that BOTH cats are participating and are sitting through this the entire time. 

H O W
How the fuck does one get a cat to sit still like this for so long?
u/cutekillerwolf  


If you would freakin unblock me I could have posted this to your wall
A couple of teachers pets
This needs some dubbing, so much potential here.
I like how the other cat looked at them and went: "bruh this is the wrong class"
This reminds me of the Monty Python "Confuse a cat" bit. 

https://youtu.be/1tsIxNci_dE
I like how they’re actually just sitting there paying attention
Those cats are surprisingly chill. My cat would freak the fuck out.
These cats are like... I don't have any thumbs.
The cats look incredibly polite and well mannered.
These cats have been through this shit multiple times. No way in hell I could even convince my cat to get into a chair like that, nevermind stay there.
Cats looking at each other like “the fuck is she pointing at me for?”
Cat at school. 


what will he learn.
I love that they're actually paying attention
I am in tears!!  This should be in r/funny not aww.
Cat: f****n hell this lockdown
This is so cute. You know those two cats get so much as attention from her.
This is the best thing I've seen in my entire life
This sub has peaked
I have a lot of questions
Shes training the palicos to identify herbs for the hunters.
I'm more impressed that she got two cats to _sit in fucking chairs_ and listen to her.
Come on cats, You can draw I know it
This is so wholesome
This is so cute
Cats: where's my fucking food
Not speaking her language, I feel like I can empathize with the experience of these cats.
I like the cats sitting position
This is the best video I’ve ever seen in my life.
Sure.  You chortle to yourself now at how cute this is now.  But what you don't know is that the girl in the video is a real battleaxe off camera (What kinda cats would sit like that of their own volition?).  When you see those cats churning out Mozart in a few years time - You better lookout, man.  She'll be coming to teach your sorry ass a lesson next.
Those cats are more behaved and focused than a lot of my students.
I’m Brazilian, so I can understand what she’s saying and it’s even more cute
It’s like: “and that’s how you draw a flower! Did you understand Roberto? (Cat’s name), did you understand João? (Cat’s name).”
When the white cat turned to look at the other one I kinda lost it!
I bet them cats are thinking "wtf is going on right now." Cute
like how the white one is nodding like "yeah i got it"
She draws wonderfully well for her age. The cats should be grateful for such a good teacher.
If we don’t get wet food out of this
"I don't have fucking fingers, kid"
Those cats look engaged
NGL the right cat is better at drawing then me.
How the hell did she get the cats to sit quietly in chairs looks that?
I was half expecting the cats to draw lol
“Man when we gon use this in real life bruh?” - cat 1 

“Yeah, I just want to be hokage” - cat 2
“Bro what the fuck is she talking about?”
I’ve been there, my cats and I have done that too 😂🐈
She genuinely believes she’s teaching them, this is absolutely wonderful
The cattos are so chill. omg
Aww they're all so cute. The cats are so well behaved!
This thing good for meme
The gray cat is like “ay you taking notes on this?”
.
What language is she speaking?
My brother did the same with the cats when he was young. But our cat just slept through, these two are quite interesting.
Cat to other cat..... "Dude...I am soooo baked right now..."
Either she's a shitty teacher or those cats are shitty students, cuz they ain't drawing shit. I don't even think they're listening to her.
I have 2 cats looking like that and a son.   
I will do a remake of this.
“I thought we were getting fed”
They’re actually looking at her like “am i going to be tested on this?” 😂😂😂
This was really surreal. Almost like a dream sequence.
Are those cats drugged look at the little furry monsters just sitting there??

She has them hypnotized!
I deeply connect with the white cat. It looks like me in grade school trying to understand what the hell the teacher is talking about.
Did they even draw flowers in the end? Her talent seems wasted on these kids.
How does one get cats to sit in a chair like that?
Me explaining the plot of Avatar to my parents...
"be quiet hooman and go get us some tuna!"
I needed this wholesomeness with all the terrible news lately. Thank you
Those cats are so cute sitting up like that
I can’t even get my cat to stand still long enough for a decent picture!
'Damn it Jerry. You said this was the room. This isn't even the right floor or the right board meeting'
Most wholesome thing I have ever seen in my entire life and this one might take the cake.
My favourite thing about this is how they’re actually sat on their butts and not standing on all four paws 😂😂😂😂
This is so sweet and wholesome. I love children and animals. And I’ve always loved videos of them interacting! The little girl is sooo cute and it’s like she’s playing pretend teacher, and her cats are the students! Oh I love it!
The fact they stay there! My cat would bail as soon as I put him down
I'ma amazed that those cats are actually looking at her
How did she actually get the cats to sit in the chairs?
How the hell did she get the cats to sit there so patiently????!?!?!?
"Maybe we should tell her we're cats?"
Did she glue them to the chairs?
How can rhe cats be so calm
Those cats obviously can’t understand her, she’s speaking in some other language.
K. Where's the fish, yo?
Bro, the cats are sitting
Why was I expecting the cats to draw smh
I love how they snap back to attention when she looks back to them. How adorable!
Those cats are on ketamine
Why did I think the cats were going to learn something?
I wanna live in that world please
Cat1: what she sayin man  
Cat2:iono i dont speak hooman  
Cat1: aw fck

What kind of adorable black magic voodoo did she use to make those cats behave so well and sit where she wanted them to
Omg, this brightened me up!
I mean its cute but I hate everything else about it. I imagine the mother that came up with this video and made the cats sit like that (I can just imagine how she menaged that). Also look at the confused child looking at the camera "mom am I doing good"?
There is only one way that I know of to get two cats to remain seated for so long in those little chairs, and that is by stapling their butts to the chairs.
How the fuck are they sitting so still. That’s the real kicker here
Adorable
Wtf those cats sit better than me holy shit
This took the edge off of some rage and frustration at the current situation. Thanks for sharing it.
This is fantastic. Golden. Wonderful. Tremendous. Adorable. Perhaps I should try teaching my cats to draw something, though I doubt I can teach as good as her
Those cats are so patient and sitting in chairs so well!!!
Those bois are Chonky !
They’re paying so much attention lmfao
LMFAOOOOO they way they’re sitting paying attention is hilarious!
u/black_like_my_soul_
They aren’t even trying.
These cats have patience of the saint.
Excellent students. Very attentive. She must be a very patient and talented teacher. Amazing
Whoever got those cats to sit in those chairs.... hats off to you
the way they just sit there and listen 😂
Are those cats glued down?
Is nobody going to talk about the cats being over fed?
man these cats love that little girl
Oh my heart.
I’m surprised the cats aren’t smacking the markers off the table. 

Seems like this isn’t their first class. 

Some educated kitties here.
no but really how tf are these cats sitting? Did the parents train them? Do they just... do this normally? Is this girl some ultimate cat trainer?
Lol, the last look she gave the cats like, “why the hell r they not drawing!?”
I'm guessing that the cats are served their meals at this table and they are trained to wait patiently like this?
I like how in the beginning the cat on the right is like "Why did I sign up for this? I could be ripping cardboard boxes right n... Oh shit she's looking!"
Thia is one of the cutest things I've ever seen on reddit.
Unpopular but safe opinion:

 Don't teach your kid that it's okay to manipulate animals into unnatural positions no matter how "cute" the objective.

The next time this kid tries to do this it might be unsupervised and to the wrong animal.
Well isn't this just a little bit wholesome :)
Are the cats glued to the chairs? I've never seen such obedient cats until I joined reddit.
Cool! 😁👌
How the heck are they sitting so still!? Haha
I watched this while listening to “Rock Me Amadeus”. Interesting
Some studious students little girl got there!!!
Dude look at their paws
Sweet little girl!
Cats sitting and paying attention like it’s a kindergarten class?! INSANE
cutest thing in the world
When my daughter was her age she tried to teach the cats to read, I don't believe she was successful.
I love watching watching kids interact with pets. I wish I had pets when I was a kid and I wish I had a kid and pets now.
A good teacher for good students.
Observant cats.
How the hell did she manage to capture their attention for that long? 🥜
These cats look just like two of mine and they have a similar temperament!
“When’s lunch time?”
These cats have better chair posture and attention spans than me. Delete this.
They're cats.

They're better behaved and more attentive than my students in high school.
I wish I had classmates like that.
Whyaat
The cat on the left look at the cat on the right: "you know what's going on?"

Cat on the right:"shhh pay attention"
The cats are just as confused as me
I feel she should have started with a moth and meoved to flora stilllifes once they purrfected their techniques
That is so adorable. :)
I love how patient they are
Cats “what do you mean ‘then draw the rest of the fucking flower’?!”
I kept waiting for the cats to start drawing a flower
Dude those cats are really chill! Never seen cats learning too lol!
The cats are actually making a plan to conquer the world...
Well, when you name your cats Robert and John Henry, they will become the most studious kitties, and even go on to earn their degrees in Art Hisstory at the most purrstigious university.
waaaaaaaat
Awweee

"I'm definitely gunna fail the final" -the cat to the right
Dammit woman! I’m a sculptor!
I have a fairly terrifying 60lb bull dog that is aptly named after a mythological creature because she is such a monster.

We recently moved to a townhouse where there are a community of four street cats that have taken up residence near our community pool.

It has been immensely interesting trying to introduce my dog to cats. She is so eager to be their friend, and of course the cats are not thrilled with a huge monster getting close to them.

Over time a peace has been achieved and the cats no longer run when they see my dog, and my dog no longer tries to chase the cats. She will approach them slowly, and is learning to sit a few feet away to see if the cats are in a playful mood or not. 

The cats tolerate this, and hiss whenever my dog gets out of line, which causes my dog a great deal of emotional anxiety because she cant understand why they don't want to be her friend.
My heart just exploded.
Is she speaking cat? (I can’t tell. I’m a dog person.)
"Finally, some good fucking education"
Just keep going. When you go to jail!
Those cats have no fucking clue what's happening, and I love it.
Can someone please text gif this??
Ok this is actually so cute. 

I'm sitting in my bed reading / browsing reddit.  My older cat is chilling by my legs purring and accepting pets. While my two kittens run laps around the room. How old are the cats?
Well did they draw a flower?
Guess I am a cat since I don't understand what she is saying and I don't think that's a flower.
https://imgflip.com/i/4386mu
Oh no, the cats are evolving
More attentive than my students!
It would have been cat-tasthropic.

First you draw a circle.
I love how she looks at them for a response at the end hahaha
Cats are fucking awesome.
This is totally something my daughter would do. I can picture it now. Smh lol
“So, Robert, whatchu doing after this meeting?”

“Oh, you know, climb the shower curtain, lay down on the big human’s computer, stare at the furry-rats in the backyard. You, John?”

“Me? I was the big human’s building something really big and shiny before placing it on the high shelf. Wanna see who can knock it down first?”
I am amazed that the cats are not only staying put but paying attention.
This has more engagement than my class ever will
Those cats are like"We don't have thumbs, what does she want from us"
Yes I did mom !
I was hoping so much that at least one of the cats would pick up a pen and start to draw.  It was a great video.
That's pretty much my own level of participation in lectures
It is just me or all of u that think that cat is gonna draw a flower???
For some reason I first read the title as “little girl reacts to cat drawing a flower”.
This girl could herd cats no problem
I think this is exactly what my cats experience when I speak to them. I don’t understand anything
You know you've been on the internet too long when you expect the cat to grab a pen
They’re very studious little kitties!! 🐾❤️
Omg that is so cute!! The heart I didn’t know I had is melting
Wow they sat so nicely and listened to the little girl! What little sweeties
That's how I felt in pre-calc... Haven't seen x3  since high school...
That's one of the most dumbest and sadest things I've ever seen.
I feel like we all learned something today.
This is too wholesome lol
This make me want to try on a cat
They are the most patient cats in existence.
Those cats are really excited and focused in learning...specially the grey one.
I love that the cats are just sitting there so calmly and watching her lesson. It's just so cute. If I put my cats somewhere that they wanted to be in the first place, they up and leave. Rude.
If they drew a picture, she'd be the greatest teacher ever!
I have some new respect for cats' patience
“Yo teach me and Lamar gotta go use the litter box if that’s cool with you”
This put me in a crying fit. My god this is so pure. Its so sweet. Im crying.........but..... how the hell do they know this it a flower?

I'm imagining post-apocalyptic 2070 when cats are taking over as liberal arts teachers; everyone is so surprised and wondering if they can handle it and this girl coolly remarking, "I was teaching cats to draw fifty years ago, damn it!"
Im just impressed that the cats stayed there that long
This is adorable! Best students ever! You could even say...*teacher's* *pets!* <3
Everybody asking how the cats are sitting there for so long.. man, they are really trying to understand something..

This is great!! We had a ginger cat that my daughter absolutely loved. She used to dress that cat in doll clothes and the cat seemed to enjoy it and would accommodate her every wish. It was a great relationship.
She's teaching the camera, still adorable though.
Douglas Roberto kkkkk
Wait they kinda learnin doe 😳😳😳
Nothing can convince me this girl isn’t the last korok I need to finish botw
Love how they're just sitting there, taking it all in.
Soooooooo... did they draw a flower or not?

Looks like a real school 😂
This is literally perfect. 

I'm laughing out of joy at the whole thing lmao 

The fucking cats just sitting there like "mmhmm" hahaha
I love that the cats are just there vibin
These cats are J CHILLIN’ lol I’m dying 🤣
Yeah... I'm done.
Yeah it's funny but you can't get cats high as shit for a cute video
I love how the cats sit there like bored half listening students.
Do you have any of those opposable thumbs layin around so we can join in?
u/vredditshare
Awww! So adorable!
Very wholesome
These cats are better students than human children.
How did she get them to sit up like that?
Jeje sentados de pana, no les voy a mentir se les ve muy fresco
I was sure the one closest to the camera was a stuffed animal until it moved its head.
Aww
Amazed both cats sat through the entire time, what a wholesome video.
aww that’s so cute
Are their paws glued to the table? Lol
Maximum adorable. Those cats will be artists before they know it.
This is legitimately the funniest thing I have seen in a while. I can't stop watching and laughing at the cats. They're like well behaved students. It's like when Archer said "Look at him, he thinks he's people!"
This video ends too soon...
what language is that?
.
These cats are going to destroy this years art show in the alley.
If they draw one I’ll shit a brick. Cute kid...
The future of the education profession is in good hands.
How to sign up my cat for this class?
She could be the #1 timeshare seller in florida panhandle region tomorrow if you let her loose.
This is so cute, I love this
And so it begins!
My cat would sit there for 0.0000000001 seconds before squirming around and knocking over everything.
In addition to being adorable this would make a good meme template
🐾I 🐾can🐾 draw🐾 a🐾 flower🐾 now🐾. Thank🐾🙏you🐾🙀
what language is she speaking?
For some reason I was expecting the cat to grab one of the pencils and draw a flower lol. Its getting late...
updoot
Why they sitting like that?
Patient felines, my tabby and siamese would bail instantly.
This is the type of content the world needs right now.
I can see this is an art class for cats, but who takes the art class for kittens?😎
I was waiting for one of the cats to raise their hand.
That’s cute.
There isn’t one thing I dislike about this video
lol I bet she is gonna grow up to be the greatest teacher ever lived
The Cats : **Interesting**
I was told there would be snacks- gray cat, probably.
I can’t bring myself to accept that those cats are real. The way they’re sitting their with their paws on the table 🥺
This is so cute.

Cat draws with paws.  Oil on catvas. Badaboom.
My cat draws way better than that flower
My first thought on these videos is always, "what kind of drugs did they give these poor animals."

Social media is big business and "cute animal videos" are a big time money maker. People are drugging animals left and right to make "cute videos" for profit.
I can’t get my cats to do this.  Are they fastened to the chairs?
I wish I could give you my power :(
I wish my cat would sit like this hahah no chance
"Bro, are you able to follow this?"

"Shhh.. I'm trying to pay attention here."

"I'm getting bored already. I saw one mice running. Did you see that?"
“How do I reach these Kitties?!?!?”
Yes, I'd like to sign up for the next quarter.
Are they drugged?! How did this happen?! . . . Two of them!
Bruh should I take notes
The white cat is a nerd.
Cat be like let’s just play along man so she doesn’t hug us to dead
Some damn good cats
Not knowing the language, it felt like this video was in the cats' POV. Imagine watching a child just blabber gibberish obviously wanting your attention but you don't know for why

That's my Chewie and Lucas. Looks exactly like them from behind down to the markings and everything. I hope they're living the good life like this somewhere.
This is the most wholesome thing my eyes have ever seen.
This is cute how these kitties are listening to her without creating any disturbance. This is always tough for me. LOL
only one thought comes in mind .... so cute!!!
Barf.
Her father posted this yesterday and then you repost today?
I love how the cats stay there like they know this is for her happiness xD
They smoked all the cat nip before class.
“How dare she mock our lack of opposable thumbs!”
Imagine one of the cats suddenly picking up a pen and starting to draw a flower.
“Hey Mittens, can I borrow your notes later?”

“You can’t even read, Carl.”
Thanks for this. All 3 are amazing.
They're so patient. What great cats.
Those two cats look exactly like my neighbor’s cats
where am i
Those cats are like “can we go now? We got throwing up to do.”
Alright men no monkey business only cat business
Videos like this are so important, especially at a time when the world seems so messed up.

If cats can sit there and learn, so can we.
The first frame was cute enough.

This is great.
> Can’t be able to draw one.
This is what I subscribed to the interwebs for.
My idiot brain was actually waiting for them to start drawing...
No way those are real cats.
Cute
This is prime entertainment right here
/u/vredditshare
She draws better than me
“She interrupted our card game for this?”
haha
This made my day
The only explanation is those cats are physically restrained in those chairs.
Cats: Let me go, please
Why do those cats look like they are on the Board of Directors?
Wow... apparently cats are brighter than dogs. All my dog can draw is a stickman
Kitties have no choice, either sit or get straight F.
That’s so fucking cute, I’m not a cat person but goddamn that’s adorable
Every time the cats step outta place the mom beats them back into their chair until they learn to sit and watch.
cats didn't even pick up pencil. reported for clackbait
Petition to sticky this post in /r/thisismylifenow
that's so sweet I started having diabetes
These cats are more patient than I am
Any still from this video is r/WTF
u/vredditshare
A+
Those cats are more attentive than I was during class.
Awww That's the cutest thing I've ever seen today :)
Can some one please please turn this into a r/AnimalTextGifs content!!!
Those cats are good students!
Hahahahaha
😍
These cats are so tolerant, reminds me of my tommy, I would wrap him up like a burrito and push him in a stroller.
From someone who had a little sister who had cats, i can understand theire fear.
So cute
How'd she get them to stay so still?
Yeah.  
Like they got it.
such good felines and that girl looks smart
Made me smile
I see some meme potential
Poor cats
They're such good learners
Now that is so sweet😇
adorable
I love this
Now this is actually cute 😍❤️
I’m amazed on so many levels. Lol. To cute!
That’s adorable
Well behaved cats ! Where is the cat's flower picture ?
So adorable!
Incredible. Cutest ever.
"Yo Steve, does this girl think we're humans? We can't draw, we don't have opposable thumbs."
What language is she speaking?
1 girl 2 cats
Yeah, the cats are more disciplined and attentive than my ADULT students. 

I was also waiting for their flower though ......
Just listen to her or else she will cry!
Typical last benchers
Good kitties
I... couldn’t... understand— am I just being stupid?
That is too cute.
So interested
I needed some eye bleach thanks
The next Da Vincis
Natural teacher
This is the cutest thing ever. I wish the video was extended to see if she went up to the cats and helped hold the crayons (or whatever they were using) to help them actually draw the flower
The black cat was looking at the other like :"Ey Tony what the fuck are we supposed to do here?"
The cats obviously adore her
 This vid is even more awesome if you understand what she is saying.
I usually wouldn't comment on things like this, but i love cats. This is adorable!
Me & Cats : What is this shit?
Cat 1: If we sit here, we shall receive food

Cat 2: Yes. The little human surely has food on her
When your parents act interested in front of you to make you happy even though they aren't interested at all
If the cat gets that pen and draw im gonna lose it 😂😂
I love the fact that they're so focus on what she's doing
Girl is either a Cat Whisperer, Disney Princess or X-Men - she got the kitties to stay in their chairs for the whole 53 second video AND pay attention to her.

Either way, she's got flair, she's got talent.
When its 2AM and you hit the cat nip way to hard.
Look at them sitting! My cat would go nuts! I should show this video to my cat as an example of good behaviour.
“We should stay, Carl. It’s good for her development.”
Those cats are either drugged or anchored to the chairs.  No way any normal cat is sitting like that.
The cats paying attention lol and your daughter
SophistiCATed
I definitely used to play school with my cat and teach her math (an area I was struggling in) and she stayed every time (who knows why). Cats are odd ones.
Little girl finna make me act up
Wth is there a Oko-Nissa deck without Forest?
I’m surprised the cats are actually willing to sit still for so long instead of wondering off somewhere
I'm extremely impressed that the cats are sitting still so neatly.
Me during lockdown tbh.
Those cats are so high
r/mademesmile
This reminds me of formerly
Why can i upvote this only once?!
Awwww so cute! Oh, the girl is cute too I guess.
What wel behaved students
This reminded me how I was teaching alphabet to my parrot.
This one really made my day :3
The cats look very interested in the lecture
Shes so invested in the explination. I love it!
What did you have to tie the cats down with to get them to sit still for that long
u/vredditshare
Its so cute when the girl is teachings the cats. Its just like she want to be a teacher someday.
The cats are me and my friend waiting for the teacher to allow us draw
She seems to be speaking Portuguese (she has a brazillian accent so probably brazillian Portuguese instead) but she's so young that she's mispronouncing a lot of it. Aww she's so cute!!
