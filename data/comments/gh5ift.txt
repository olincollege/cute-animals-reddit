Now that is a good feeling. For both!
I was in 5th grade when I started watching and playing Pok√©mon. I am watching the first series with my 2 young sons right now on Netflix. Since Netflix always skips the intro, we always rewind it to sing the intro song. I've gotten pretty good at singing it.
This was so adorable! The pure joy from both of you is incredible
What a sweetheart! I hope she keeps having fun with this lovely game
I still remember the time when I caught Oddish with a masterball. My cousin is pissed, we had a great fight tho.
damn I‚Äôve never been that excited in my whole life
Op if you read this and you plan on playing other games with her, do what I do and take a picture of each game you both start (or finish). I started doing it with my daughter when she was three (she‚Äôs five now) and we‚Äôve finished 3 or so and it‚Äôs nice to look bAck on.
When my daughter was five I played Pokemon Yellow with her for her first journey.  She ran the squad and choose to never evolve squirtle as her main Pokemon for the whole game. A bit of a challenge, but nothing an old Pokemon master couldn't navigate. I'll never forget winning the Pokemon league the first time.

Then it was Gold, then Pokemon X, Pokemon Moon and Shield through the years. Today I have a seven year old Pokemon fanatic whose favorite pokemon is Sylveon.

We pass the torch.
That is wholesome as anything. Brings back the feels from the old games.
One day I‚Äôll have a son/daughter who will slay his/hers first Dark Souls Boss.
I don‚Äôt want kids but little things like this makes me want one...

Too cute
Did she give it a name?
You didn't tell her to mash A to insure the capture was successful..You are a bad pokemon trainer trainer!

&#x200B;

good father though.
That is so sweet!
Finally, a generation of parents who love what makes everyone happy
I Wish I had a daddy like this.
I am poor so here you go üèÖ
She's never gonna forget that spearow
I love how the dad is almost more excited
Me but every time I catch a new Pok√©mon
That is one good looking man
she‚Äôs so excited! i‚Äôm so excited for her! man, it‚Äôs been so long since i caught my very first pokemon...
So sweet it gave me diabeetus. Lol
I remember the first time I crossed Nugget bridge as a kid and seriously SERIOUSLY debating whether or not I should take the Team Rocket up on joining. Like, ‚Äúquiet Mom! I need to consider this!‚Äù
she's your clone
This is very cute but how does she have a Pikachu of spearow is the first Pokemon she caught?
He can take the chance to teach his kid the true value of determination and sheer will.

Capture a Metapod, with a Magikarp.
My boyfriend's daughter got pokemon sword for Christmas and a few months ago he had a look at her save file, just to see how she was getting on. She was about 3 towns in (I don't play so forgive me if that's wrong) but had no pokemon in her file at all. Not even her starter pokemon. He asked her about it and apparently she's been catching plenty then just... releasing them again.

We call it her "Catch and Release Program".
Can‚Äôt wait to have a kid and experience these things once she or he is old enough to play videogames.
Pokemon is just timeless sort of like Legos since you can be any age and enjoy it.

I feel old just thinking about the fact its a 20+ year old franchise now.
I hope she trains and evolves that Spearo into a fearo and uses it to fly around <3
I'll be real. Usually when someone posts kids to aww I get irritated (hit me with the downvotes). I kinda relived my childhood through this girl's reaction though and I feel warm and fuzzy inside. That's good parenting, well done both of you
This is probably the third video I've seen of you and your kids on here and I just have to say that you are doing a really freaking great job at parenting. Has genuinely brought a smile to my face everytime I've seen one of your videos.
Its not a rattata 0/10 (/s)
But what did she name it?
E V E R Y O N E  L I K E D  T H A T
Daughter and dad look alike so much! Keep her happy man! Daughters usually look up alot at their dad.
The genes shared between you two is incredible. She literally looks like the girl child version of you playing this game back then.
This warms my heart sooooooo much!!! She'll be chasing the high for the rest of her life because you can never get enough of Pok√©mon!!
If I ever get my own children, I want to experience this in the same way.

This touched my heart. It's so sweet.
How did she get a Pikachu as her starter?
Never forget this moment. You have guaranteed the next generation will continue on playing the best game to ever be created üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't even enjoy posts with kids, but that melted my heart. Wholesome af.
This is so adorable. As a mother, on Mother's Day, I can say one of the best gifts year-round to a mother is having the father of their children be involved and loving.
This is how I picture being a father. Very heartwarming.
Give her a few years and show her Colosseum. The first time you steal someone's pokemon is somehow even better.
My dad died when I was young, wish I could have had moments like these. She will remember these moments her whole life, keep up the great work!
You seem like a good father!
I wish I could go back to that first time I played Red version
that, that brings back so many memories :D
I'm glad her first catch was spearow. I love spearow :)
About to pop my missingno cheat for inf Master balls ü§£
And a level 5 nonetheless.. Gotta catch em all!
Really hoping to see you two beat the snot out of the elite four, the hunt is on!!
How do people stream them playing Pok√©mon and themselves? Is it an emulator?
A great trainer in the making!
Another childhood is transformed forever by Pokemon.
I was a little older but I‚Äôll never forget catching Rayquaza with a Pokeball.  I thought I had accomplished a feat that could not be done again and just HAD to tell everyone lmao. Nice video
How I've forgotten the the joy of catching Pokemon, I've lost this kid inside of me and I needed this to help find him. 

I'm running like a factory, catching and breeding to get Perfect Pokemon. Only caring about thrashing of my opponents and not the joys of being a trainer. I'm disgusted by myself.
[deleted]
I gotta know what did she name it?
this is incredibly sweet! brought tears to my eyes bc it reminded me of how much fun I had when I played my first Pokemon game. 18 years later, I‚Äôm still playing Pok√©mon on my switch, and still having a blast! Encourage her to keep playing, the Pokemon world truly is a wonderful world! :)
It's Christmas Day, 1998, and my Dad is hovering over top of me and my Gameboy Color doing the exact same thing. This is so real.
As a single nerdy dude who wants a family, this brings a tear to my eye. Well done pops
crying irl. thx. cant wait. my daughter likes to sit on my lap and smash the keyboard when she can. gave her the controller to start playing with now too lol.
Me when catching mewtwo with the Ultra Ball
I still remember that feeling! I'm glad to know that the new generation can still appreciate this classic game.
I can't wait to do this with my kid. She's three and loves the series already.
Getting to watch my 6yo son play pokemon on switch has been a blast. I wish I had filmed it like you had. This is just happy and wholesome and amazing. So what did she name it?
Its james Marriott
This is so cute! Good choice starting her on Fire Red/Leaf Green.
This is what it is all about. Nothing can replace that feeling for either of them.
That‚Äôs just the best
This is adorable and definitely the right pokemon generation to start the kid out with
Spearow was my first too :‚Äô) god bless this dad
This is so sweet! Hope she carries on playing! :)
It's a beautiful day for rain
Scrolling really fast I thought you were Channing Tatum. I hope you and your daughter have a great time playing!
She‚Äôs concentrating so hard.   Adorable.
U/vredditdownloader
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre passing the sacred arts to the next generation
u/vredditdownloader
What's his nickname!
Such a wonderful video. Perfect choice for her first game. I think LG/FR provide the quintessential pokemon experience.
I‚Äôd been thinking about how I would show my kiddos the games I grew up on(without buying old consoles) & had completely forgotten about emulators. I‚Äôd imagine a mouse & keyboard would feel pretty natural to kids today, too, since so much of our life is spent in the digital realm. This really got me in the feels, as Pok√©mon was my first game, & Gameboy Color was my first console. Thanks for sharing this.
You look like Charles Cornell
This really made my day. Good stuff.
The universal gamer lean in of anticipation as she waited for the pokeball to stop moving lol
The most wholesome thing i have ever seen in my entire life oh my god.
Starting her with fire red/leaf green. Serious respect!
If I ever become a father I hope I can have a moment like this with my kid
I needed this. Thank you for posting
She will spend the rest of her life trying to experience that first high again.  Every addict will tell you it can't ever quite be repeated!
This is so magical
Watch, Spearow will be her favorite Pokemon forever!! Hah hah! 

When I was younger I got Pokemon red when it first came out as well as link cables to trade and what not. My friend at the time needed a Squirtle so I picked Squirtle and played up till I could trade. He gave me a Vaporeon and said it was as good as a Squirtle. 

All these years later Vaporeon is my favorite Pokemon, I used it in ever game and give it the same name. Recently since home came out I was able to transfer all my Vaporeons I have from my games into home! 

I LOVE Vaporeon!! And it was such a staple part of my childhood due to my friends reaction to getting Squirtle I still remember the joy on his face! I don't remember why he needed it but to this day Vaporeon makes me so happy!
^I ^GOT ^IT ^I ^GOT ^IT ^HEE ^HEE
We need more of this in the world. Thank you for sharing.

This shit is amazing
That was so wholesome I could die
 stahp, otherwise I‚Äôm gonna have to become a dad. Too cute and heartwarming!
I may or may not have gotten teary eyed. Congrats!
Nothing can ever recreate that joy of the first catch.
this is so cute, it reminded me of when my older brother taught me about pokemon in 3rd grade on HGSS. its a memory i cherish years later, like im sure she will as well :) üíï
Post her reaction when she catches a legendary
Official, better than Ash.
This is so adorable. I don't even know you guys and i'm proud!!!
I imagine her favorite Pokemon is now Spearow.
This is so adorable.  I think dad is as excited as daughter.  Can't wait until Pokemon Go is safe again for her... There's nothing like finding them in the wild. üß°
Bruh, I wish I were old enough to adopt a child (I don‚Äôt want one of my own kind of)
This should be x-posted on r/wholesome
This is what I love about Emulators. You get to share old gems with people who otherwise  might find them inaccessible. And get to enjoy them like this together.
This is food for the soul, the smiles and the joy, I remember that feeling well
This is precious. Still doesn't make me want to have my own, but still precious.
She gonna be the very best like no one ever was.
.
The best thing about this is if she stays into gaming, she‚Äôs probably going to remember this moment for the rest of her life. Congratulations my man, you just did something amazing :)
My fuxking ears also that‚Äôs cool.
Is this the same guy that showed what happens during his work day with his kids there?  He seems like a super chill dad.
What an awesome moment!! I still remember when my grandma gave me my first gameboy with Pokemon red. I can‚Äôt even describe the feeling and I remember it vividly. Out of all the gifts I‚Äôve ever received, that‚Äôs probably the one I feel the most nostalgia for, I cherished that game. What a wonderful world you‚Äôve introduced your daughter to, I feel so excited for her :)
Oh, my heart. 

That footage better all over the place at her 21st. 

Beautiful moment.
The joy on her face is how I wish I was everyday
Mah hert mah soal
Did you guys nickname Spearow?
Today I (21F) finally beat the Elite Four and became the champion. This video brought be so much joy. I hope she catches them all!
You‚Äôre the best father you must be very nice :)
Parenting 101
Damn that‚Äôs super cute
That is always fun.
Holly shit at the awards lol
From one generation to the next üòä
this vid made me smile
When is she gonna get a job?
This definitely deserves the awards this has because this is so heckin cute.
Remember when you didn‚Äôt have to film yourself doing every fucking little thing.
Cute video but it‚Äôs got me wondering: is there any science that goes into the benefits of talking to your children in a voice that isn‚Äôt your normal one?

Like, if you somehow could raise a child talking in a baby voice to them while they were young, then raise them the exact same but never changing your voice whatsoever, is there any data that would support there being any difference?
My wife is due in 3 weeks with our daughter. This hit me real good.
That's me when I'll have a child (I hope I will). Pokemon means a damn lot to me, it brought me through my childhood. It was with me since playschool and it still is now 20 years later. The current pokemon fanbase don't want to here this but the first and second gen still are the best imo. It's probably nostalgic reasons but I don't care. I always dream about me introducing my child to pokemon and as it was with me, I want to show him the first pokemon games (Kanto). Great to see that you can also introduce your daughter to it and she is really happy about it.

Hope I'll have a child too and will like pokemon aswell.
Congrats you got yourself some amazing footage to look back on for the rest of your life. That was freaking awesome man!!!
I‚Äôm too young. I‚Äôm too young. I‚Äôm too young. I‚Äôm too young. I‚Äôm too young. I‚Äôm too young...
There are tears in my eyes
After watching this , I just reajusted my whole life goal .
This is prime wholesome content. Dad and daughter delighted at the same simple joys. So happy you get to share this with her!!
This is utterly adorable! Can't wait to have moments like this when my daughter grows up!
Hope she remembers that Spearow for the rest of her life.  Good job Dad.
As a dad, I appreciate this post. I‚Äôm really excited to play the co-op story mode in Sword and Shield with my daughter, Zelda. (Yes, my wife let me name her that and her initials are ZOD, so ‚ÄúKneel Before ZOD‚Äù.) It‚Äôs truly and enlightening time to get to bond with your kiddo over some Pok√©mon and watch the joy on their face beating their first gym or catching their first legendary with no outside assistance.
Awww he must just love sharing this moment with her. Since he knows how great this feeling is, he gets to live it twice with someone very special.
That was adorable. Coincidentally, that‚Äôs my reaction to getting my first cup of coffee in the morning.
This is adorable. Now to show her how to simultaneously smash the A and B buttons to ensure a good capture lol
I mean this in a good way but this is how I imagine most Reddit parents lol
One word: Wholesome
You are gonna be the coolest dad daughter combo ever
OH MY GOD MY HEART IS BREAKING
Ok, that made my day. Thank you!! :)
Obviously it‚Äôs not obligatory for children to love what you loved, but I really hope I can connect with my child (currently fetus) one day on something I was passionate about as a kid. Like if my child says ‚Äúhey Mom I really like musicals‚Äù I‚Äôll be like ‚Äúbruuuuuh pack your bag right now, we heading to Broadway!‚Äù
What a cool dad
Just seems so disengenuine knowing you're hamming it up for the camera and reddit karma
I love how he was waiting on her reaction. All the feels ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ohhh my heart , this is too sweet
This is  so adorable!!!
Aw that's precious man, some beautiful memories in the making
Such wholesome content. Right in the feels ‚ù§Ô∏è
You are the best dad! You are definitely parenting the best parenting possible! :)
this is so cute!!
My cheeks touched my ears watching this
Aw love this! Great moment
This is stupid cute
This is adorable
Whose cutting onions in here?? 

Seriously awesome moment, shows how rewarding and great it feels to not only play videogames but to play them with your parents
Congrats on baby #3
That's awesome.
You're an awesome parent. 100%
I wanna be the very best!
Which version of Pok√©mon is this?
Wow!  The look of sweet success.
That‚Äôs awesome man.
WHAT DID SHE NAME IT PLEASE TELL ME
This brings me so much hecking joy
Heck yeah.
That's so sweet! I can't wait until our little guy is old enough to play :)
I didnt know I could feel so happy for and proud of some kid I've never even met. 

I'm just so glad for her idk I'm in unchartered territory here
Dude the way you pointed at the pokeball on the menu on your TV seemed like the most joy in the whole video. That's a proud dad
i wish spearow made me that happy : )
This dude is killing it in quarantine.
She looks just like you guy, absolutely adorable!
ok that's enough cuteness for me today
This is so wholesome
This brings back memories of the good old days of Gameboy Advance. Nostalgia hitting hard!
Such a lovely moment! I cant wait till my son is older so I can enjoy this moment too!!
This was so heartwarming ‚ù§Ô∏è
I actually stole my first pokemon game from a kid in my kung-fu class because I didnt often receive video games or the money to buy them, so it seemed the logical choice. 

First day I sit down to play it and I catch my Pidgey. I was so excite, it had felt like nothing ever had before. In my excitement I run downstairs with my gameboy to show my mom. "Mom, mom I caught a Pidgey in Pokemon!" I say to her, beaming with glee. Of course, she didnt buy the game for me and neither did my dad, so the jig was absolutely up at that point. 

Yes, let me show you my crimes, mother! Arent you proud?? I was a stupid child lmao.
Future super metroid any% world record holder right there.
I'm only 20, but this makes me very excited for the day that I get to share those moments with my kids.
priceless moments!
so wholesome
It has begun.
I can guarantee you he Remembers his first Pok√©mon and the world of joy it brought him and he wants to same for his daughter which is just so wholesome he is passing down his teachings and his knowledge for the game onto his daughter
This is literally me, she just channeled all the energy of grown ass adults
Beautiful
That exhale of excitement and happiness is what we live for as parents. Excellent dad‚Äôing my man! Have a Gold!
My 6 year old second cousins first Pokemon was a Pidgey and he proudly named that bird after himself.
Wish I could catch that pure joy in a pok√©ball.
One of the few things that‚Äôs brightened my day on here lately, have my upvote!
The first time is the best. Now she's gonna be chasing that high the rest of her life. An addict has been born.
Very nice. Time to build her a PC.
But what is its name?
Yes!! This is the best. I play pokemon with my daughter all the time (shield currently). She acts exactly the same way now even after shes caught 200+ of them. Good for these two.
What a great reaction.
My god she has your exact eyes and brow!  Great dadding. Can‚Äôt wait to play games with mine.
Is there a name for that joy fill heart swelling feeling that nearly brings you to tears?
Fire Red/Leaf Green. Nice choice!
Your daughter's reaction when she threw the pokeball; you could tell she REALLY wanted it to work.
This will always be one of my favorite games. This I‚Äôm the one on game boy Advance?
read the title and went "oh s\*\*t i have to see this"
are you even supposed to be here today?
r/mademesmile
She's gonna be the very best that no one ever was, that's for sure.
Oh how the joy of your first caught Pok√©mon
Why'd she name her pikachu Du
That is exactly how I reacted when I caught Lugia for the first time when I was 8 years old.
Omg this is just so pure
Such joy. Thank you for this.
So adorable!

Your daughter looks just like you!  You have the same eyes and smile!!
I really hope i can get such a great bond with my kids later.
Now she needs to nick name it Aaaaaaaaa
and with that, a new gamer was born.
How old? Mines just turning 1 and I'm excited for this moment down the road!
Damn. That was amazing. Gotta try it with my child whenever that happens
What are y‚Äôall playing on? I was thinking about buying my 8 year old a 3ds so he could play some games but I wanted to start him with firered/leafgreen
u/VredditDownloader
I want kids now
Sick!
Are you the same guy who posted that working from home vid where your kids kept coming in lmao
Good job kid, you caught a sparrow. *Takes huge puff of cigarette before putting it out* 

now go catch one of the legendary dogs without a master ball then ill be impressed.
This is what I needed today, thank you!
That was absolutely adorable, I can only imagine how nice it'll be to look back on this video for them in 10 years time.
I can‚Äôt wait to do this with my (future) kids. My wife and I were just talking last night about purposely not telling them anything about Star Wars so we can see the look on their face for the Darth Vader reveal in Empire.
We grew up on these games so there‚Äôs that satisfaction of having our spawns enjoy it as much as we do. Especially when they have all these futuristic games, can never go wrong with some old school Pok√©mon!
I'm just waiting for them to go catch Mewto and then he can hear his daughter saying fuck this shit for the first time ever.
So awesome! Congrats, you‚Äôre going to love it
Same cute smile
Oh boy just wait til she finds her first shiny!
this is sooooo cute! <3
Idk why i had so many goosebumps watching this
Now that's the kind of parent I want to be
I wanna be, the very best
What did you name it?
Uggghh this is too damn sweet for my stone cold heart
The squeaky "haha" is the most adorable innocent and happy laughter ever.
Wholesome. Can't wait to introduce Pok√©mon to my kids... when I have them.
My father never gave me this
Absolutely great
Not gonna lie I teared up a little
MEGA wholesome. Congrats. She's gonna be the best, like no one ever was.
This was way too cuteü•∫
She looks like Lucy from breaking bad, so many mixed emotions while watching this
You see videos like that one kid trying to blow out his brothers birthday candles, or the picture of the kid that threw his shit on the walls and you think, "No way do I want kids".

Then you see these kind of vids and you think,

"Maybe"
It's so exciting! You guys made me smile hard.

Now to complete the Pokedex
She named her Pickachu, Du. I was waiting for that Spearow's nickname. You deprived me of it, OP.
Now this is good parenting
What did they name it?
This is one of those things that puts a smile on my face :)
I don't know you, but I love you both. This is the most heartwarming thing I have ever seen.
This is the kind of video that makes me want to have a kid someday.
He looked at her after the animation. But knew she doesn't and waited until she realized caught it. Too cute
Are they playing this on PC?
That left tears in my eyes... damn
Your joy at her joy is amazing to see :)
Seriously though I miss that absolute excitement I got as a kid playing Pok√©mon. I remember the first day I ever played. Pok√©mon red/blue had just come out and I got the gameboy color and Pok√©mon blue for Christmas. I was enveloped in the game for months.
Team Reddit‚Äôs shedding tears AGAAAaaiiinnn
Omgosh this is SO wholesome and sweet. Thank you for sharing!
aww, warms my frozen heart
OP no longer even trying to making videos of trying to get his work done with his kids interrupting. Now resolved to just playing Pokemon. Fair trade.
Wholesome as FUCK. love this
MY HEART
Adorable. Cant wait to introduce pokemon to my own kids
Same smile! It was lovely to see. Thanks for sharing
Raising children is tough, but moments like this are beyond priceless. I hope you save this in a good place
That kid is going places... To play Pokemon Go
Next stop, the Indigo Plateau!
TBH this is probably the only reason I‚Äôd have a kid.
So proud
I am a "i will never have childrens" type of person, but this things make me realize how can i be so stupid...
Woooooooooow now I want kids even more what awesome feeling that must‚Äôve been!!
I was watching this a bit last night and it was so awesome to see her reaction when all the starters were gone but Prof.Oak surprised her w/ Pikachu! I think she nicknamed it ‚ÄúDuhh‚Äù lol

Edit: Guess she settled on ‚ÄúDu‚Äù :)
That's awesome!!
That brings me back to my first Pidgey. How sweet!
You sure she's your daughter? She only looks EXACTLY LIKE YOU!
This makes me feel so happy and I feel the excitement and pride from both of them! I can‚Äôt wait to do this someday with my daughter.
Get them into the good old games we played growing up.
Gotta teach them the basics at a young age
SHE CAUGHT IT! SHE CAUGHT IT! SHE CAUGHT IT!!!!!!!!
Oh my god. I saw this video on mute and could remember every sound made in the game while it was bring caught. Such memories.  What a brilliant experience he had with his daughter! Good on you!
Is this Markiplier in an alternate universe?
I love this sm
This is my favorite video ever
Adorable!
You're gonna be so sorry when she's 15 and an ultra competitive gamer girl!!  (I'm kidding, mostly)
This is so wholesome r/mademesmile
lmao wait you‚Äôre the same guy who‚Äôs daughters kept walking in during your work
do people not smash A anymore when they're catching a pokemon?
FRLG... this guy knows where the good games are at, lol. One of my absolute favorites
It was funny because at first it seemed Dad might have been more into it than the daughter. Then boom I CAUGHT IT I CAUGHT IT!
So cute
Wholesome
The memories of me catching my first Pok√©mon are flooding back to me. I always loved starting a new journey in the world of pokemon
Which pokemon game is this
This made me smile, thank you for that i really needed that.
Enter James Franco: ‚ÄúFirst time?‚Äù
So cute :D
Does someone have a towel? My heart melted all over the place
Her sister isn‚Äôt sleeping anymore.
So Awesome!
Cute as heck
That is so wholesome it makes we want to force my teenager to play videogames with me.
I love this so much!!!!
Not to mention Spearow is the best. I always kept one til the end
This is how good memories are made.
I need more of this wholesome content
The excitement on both father and daughter‚Äôs faces are adorable.
Somebody cutting onions?
YES POKEMON!
This is so wholesome!
ah yes, the ubiquitous "five" when your offspring does good in a video game.
Can‚Äôt wait to have kids someday to also experience this. Great vid!
They‚Äôll love this on r/gaming
I've been playing pokemon for over 20 years and I still react that way. Every. Time. I am not what a man is supposed to be but I am okay with that... Mostly.
That is so pure. +1
My heart!
Fire Red is such a good game for young kids to get into Pok√©mon. It‚Äôs so simple and so enjoyable
Aww
This a good reason to have kids, thats just adorable, I‚Äôm very proud of her
She‚Äôs gonna have a great childhood
Omfg that was precious
[deleted]
While the kid is a sleep, use gameshark and get her a Snorlax (best pokemon, trust me).
The most wholesome video of the week goes to!
I remember the first time I played pokemon,the blue edition, I was a stupid kid that thought why the hell should I read in a game. I tried so hard to get out of the starting area but fricking Professor Oak didnt let me go. After 20 minutes I was frustrated and asked my dad.. good old times:)
OH MAN, YOU HAVE A GBA-PLAYER FOR GAMECUBE!!!!  
That's really rare.
My first Pok√©mon game was pixlemon. Sadly it got banned, first main series was sun/moon
Once the video stopped and the replay option came up, in that still of you and her she is totally your mini-me. Same expression and everything lol
Awwwww I felt like a little kid again just watching that! Man, I remember my first pokemon. A true right of passage for any child
Man, what I would not give to have one moment like this with my dad. Great moves, keep it up.
That's such a fun and adorable moment! I bet that will be a memory that randomly pops up in her head every now and then when she's an adult. Just something small that takes her back to the good times when she was a kid and her dad spent quality time with her :)
I don‚Äôt remember catching my first pokemon in Red, probably all the drugs
Is your daughter Miranda Cosgrove?
Why am I crying?
So much joy. Love it
Damn I can still remember my first time catching a Pok√©mon :D Long time ago
Holy shit that is not the voice I thought I would hear from that dude when I unmuted. lol

Super adorable either way.
This is so wholesome
Your daughter now knows the feeling as a kid catching your first pokemon.
This is all I wish for my daughter. She‚Äôs only two rn but I‚Äôm hoping to raise a great trainer one of these days
So cute.
Okay. That was the most adorable thing I've ever seen. #DadGoals
I want to have this kind of relationship with my future kids
Had the same reaction when I got a touch of consumption in RDR2
God damn this warms my heart!
you're an awesome dad
That father is adorable, look how proud he is!
That is so adorable. Playing pokemon for the first time was magical for me :)

Give us updates on her progress!!
What Pokemon game
Soooo precious
AAAGH THIS IS SO WHOLESOME MY LITTLE HEART
This made my day! üòÅ
He‚Äôs like ‚Äúquiet, Moms gonna wake up.‚Äù  At 3 am
I can feel the love. I see me with my own daughter in the future spreading love and joy like that! :]]]
You motherfucker i'm 19, i'm not supposed to want to have kids yet
This is soooo sweet. I love how her response is delayed by a few seconds while you look at her and then followed by pure joy. What a good dad!
Du Hast
Well done dad.  A solid choice.   


My daughter is 22... still loves Pokemon.
I want to see a playtrough of you guys NOW
Non of my kids want to play Pok√©mon. üòû I still do
This is just so pure!
At 26, I can confirm my reaction is the same every single time.
You are good dad. Letting her do it but with guidance.
This is so cute omg üò≠
Hell yes, good dad!
Totally precious, God bless you both and your family
Why do you have my guitar on your wall? I've got a guitar that looks just like that and it's customed by me.
Omg i remember this game  it was my first game in game boy advance really its a  good memories  the last version of pokemon games was best but not like the classic version thank you  i feel so lovely when a see this post
That reaction is priceless. She was so excited!
Now she just has to soft reset 10k times to get the shiny version. Otherwise when she finds out there‚Äôs shines versions she‚Äôll be furious she hasn‚Äôt been farming them since day one.
So adorable
This brought me back to being a kid and playing Pok√©mon. Man, I miss those classic games.
Awww
This is amazing! I'm having a baby daughter in a few months and the thought of sharing moments like this brings me to tears. Hope I can live up to the hype of a cool dad.
This is such a great clip. Him waiting for her reaction, her incredible excitement and his smile after. What a cute little moment.
That‚Äôs it I‚Äôm doing another playthrough
Haven't played Pokemon in over a year, this brought me down memory lane
Can‚Äôt wait to do this shit with my kids and dark souls
This is awesome, you have the same smile
aww you both are too adorable. made me so happy seeing this :)))
It's always something special watching someone else experience something you love for the first time.
Spearaww
Stop it, you‚Äôre going to make me want one.
Haha that was very cute, made my day üòÅ
Won‚Äôt lie this brought a tear to my eye. The legacy continues. Thanks for keeping pokemon alive.
10/10 parenting and I cannot wait for my little girl to be old enough for this moment, I‚Äôm proud of you fella!
**God damn, what an absolute unit of a father.**
As someone who has played these games for a decade now and doubt I'll ever end up growing out of it... I am totally gonna teach my kids the way of becoming a Pok√©mon Master
My heart just melted.
It‚Äôs even better because of not only her adorability, but the guy was trying to restrain from being too excited himself. You see him reach his hand out and retract fast like he wasn‚Äôt crazy happy lol
Omg the squeal and excitement is unreal. This is so wholesome.
That's fucking awesome. I look forward having kids and playing video games with them. Then showing no mercy in competitive games.
Mrw I catch any legendary
So cool, now go out and catch em all
Made an old poke master tear up just now.
r/gaming might like this too
That is the cutest thing in the entire world. I remember when I was little I had this Dora the explorer game, and this is how I felt when I dug faster than Swiper (I don‚Äôt remember why you had to dig holes but you did).
On a computer?
Awesome video
u/vredditdownloader
Adorable
Single tear
I‚Äôm 30 and still feel this way.
Now that‚Äôs wholesome!
Should be on r/wholesome as well
Who else just wants to squeeze her?  That is the best age by the way.  Cherish this moment because they grow up so fast and before you know it they're gone.... well... thst age is gone.
the smile this gave me was unreal
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw. Such excitement, it spread onto me!
Nice
Wow that's pretty cool bro I can't wait until my daughter is old enough so that I could be doing things like this for her she's only a year-and-a-half old and I am so excited to share moments like this Twitter thank you bro for sharing that with us and have a nice day you have a beautiful child God bless
So wholesome.  Can‚Äôt wait to introduce Pok√©mon to my kids too!
So cute! All of it! The girl, the reactions, the Pikachu, the man.....
This is one of many reasons I‚Äôm excited to be a parent eventually.
r/Pokemon
AHHHH I SMILED ALL BIG
He looks a lot like David Hayter
I can't wait till I'm a old geezer gramps and tell the grand kids...back in my day our first pokemon didnt even have color....and we only had 151 to start with.
That was so sweet. Ty for sharing that special moment.
Thank you for sharing this. So heartwarming
Bro, you make me want to have a kid so bad.
WHO PUT THESE ONIONS IN FRONT OF ME
This is what the world needs right now
I just recently purchased my first Pok√©mon game at 25(Pok√©mon Sword), I‚Äôm honestly so in love with it. As the youngest sibling I simply was never given the chance to play games, just watch; so it‚Äôs nice to see her dad giving her that chance
Did she give it a nickname?
I don't have any children but this is adorable.
Cherish this moment the first catch is always special
My niece has a very similar reaction to every Pok√©mon she catches on Pok√©mon go for me!
This is the most adorable thing I've ever seen!
Wholesome 1000000
‚ÄúI caught it, I caught it!‚Äù ü•∞ the best
Did you teach her the down+B trick?
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen on reddit in a while and I never even played Pok√©mon.
This is the dad I want to be.
Certified adorable!
This is awesome ! Genuinely brought a smile to my face. I grew up playing these games ands its nice to see the old version of pokemon can still excite children today.
Big pp
how are you capturing the game footage?
Dang that‚Äôs amazing; I‚Äôve always wanted to start with the first game, and slowly work them all the way up
I want to see her reaction to catching a legendary!
Omg my heart!!
She almost looks unenthused at first, but then you realise that's just laser focus.
Oh shit, what have you done
This is so wholesome üòÅ
This is life.
Right in the feels !!!
my worst fear is that my future children will hate all the video games I try to show them.
And so it begins
I like how she went from focused to ecstatic so quickly! She‚Äôs going to love her Pok√©mon journey!
Is this firered or leafgreen?
Oh my goddd
Reminds me of the first time I played pokmeon blue such a simpler time
Well time to get the ole gameboy back out again
Well, that was just a lovely thing to witness.
This is amazing! I love that you were just not excited, if not more than her too
I didn‚Äôt know I needed to see this. I‚Äôm very glad I did.
Oh my god, both your faces!  So pure
I'm normally such a grinch about this type of stuff but this is so cute
Wholesome content. I love it.
I am just about to have a baby boy and this literally brought tears to my eyes in excitement to share this kind of experience with my son.
Parenting done right.
WHY do you look like Nathan Drake and Dr.Strange at the same time?
I am 29 and I still have the same reaction when I catch a Pok√©mon which is not in registered on my Pokedex.
I love her so much!but still absolute beta gamer
I'm 27 years old and I am still the kid in this video
And you had to pick a spearow.
This is so fucking sweet, I now have diabetes
I want to be your child so I can call you daddy. Adopt me.
Now post her trying to catch mewtwo and tell her no master ball!
Beautiful family. God bless
I remember my first Pok√©mon!!! God, I didn't want to put that gameboy down lol
How does she have a Pikachu then?
Wholesome content
but did she pick charmander
I love the fact you chose this game to play with her! I'd love to have played this with my father back in the day
You seemed way more enthusiastic than she did until the catch so it kind of seemed like she wasn‚Äôt that into it, but oh my gosh I loved her reaction! Totally surprised me. This is so sweet and it must be amazing to be able to share one of your hobbies with your daughter like this.
Cool, beautiful family, keep up the good work!
Ah damn now that is something just special.
Nickname: ASSBUTT
Fucking adorable.
Wholesome
Right in the feels.
Why‚Äôs just look like Arwen from LOTR and the home alone kid at the same time
So it turns out I really just needed to see some pure joy today.
This is so great.
Aww! That reaction was awesome! Happy kids is a great booster.
This is such a beautiful moment. Makes me wonder what my first Pokemon would have been?
I loved the way he tried to peer over and see her reaction.
I want to see her play Dark Souls
Wait until she catches a legendary pokemon. Her reaction will be priceless
As one Dad to another, this is amazing. Cherish every moment like that man. I remember my daughters first like it was yesterday. She‚Äôs 7 now and we continue our gaming bond. We‚Äôve been doing a ton of Animal Crossing together now. Gonna be a special thing looking back on these memories some day.
I don‚Äôt see a single comment with the most important question of all!!!  What was the nickname????  The first pokemon you ever catch HAS to have a nickname!  It‚Äôs mandatory!  It‚Äôs tradition!
The first of many. I hope you realize the adorable addiction you've created!
Is this a dude ???
This was so pure
You love to see that
Yellow did get a remake for switch Pok√©mon Let‚Äôs Go Pilachu and Evee. They came out in 2018.
You are a good father N00bi Wank A N00bi
Oh my gosh, that little squeal!
I think FireRed/LeafGreen are the perfect starter games. First one I played and I think it‚Äôs a great introduction to the series.
lol nuts
I don‚Äôt tend to care much for kids, but this was beautiful.
Now record her frustration when she's thrown her 85th PokeBall trying to catch a legendary.
That. Was. Wholesome.
Kids can be annoying but there‚Äôs many, many times their more than worth their weight in gold and here‚Äôs the best part-They don‚Äôt know it
After her asking to feel the rubber on his phone pretty please with a cherry on top of their house for the 10000th time, her father gave up trying to work from home
I WANNA BE THE VERY BEST..
So cute!
What game is it? It looks like FrLg 3rd gen but there's no half pokeball in that and you don't start with Pikachu... A rom hack maybe?
I needed this today.
What emulator is he using
This makes me want a daughter. But that's not gonna happen =(
Yesss! That‚Äôs so cute.
God this made me feel happy. The absolute joy from both of you is incredible. You look like an amazing father and your daughter is so cute and she clearly has a lot of affection for you!

So good!
SO CUTE SAME SMILE!!
D‚Äôawww look at her. Look just like her daddy
Thanks for sharing this special moment for you two with us. Esp in this day and age... Bless
I love how you are both just as excited as each other! Such big smiles, thanks for sharing
I love this! My 7 year old stopped playing 15 minutes into Pok√©mon Sun but I was so excited for her. Its not her game. But right now we're playing LoZ Breath of the Wild. Games are so great to bond over.
So wholesome. Love it!
Love this!! Pok√©mon Go has been huge in getting us through quarantine! My 5 year old fell in love with Pok√©mon the week it all started. So now we use Pok√©mon Go playing time, cards, and figures as incentives for doing school work and for fun family time. It‚Äôs gotten him motivated to take long walks or to just be outside. His face when he catches a new one and how proud he is at winning battles is heart warming!
Pokemon Gold on gameboy was my first catch.
It's been nearly 20 years.
What a great dad!
Video games are the fucking best
I remember playing Pokemon Blue when it came out. I didn't realize you could catch more than one pokemon (despite the rather famous catchphrase of the franchise). I though each copy of the game gave you a choice between 3 random pokemon. I was surprised and so excited to catch a Metapod in Viridian Forest.
/r/daddit
My brother introduced me to video games, and that‚Äôs a memory I cherish forever. I hope this little girl becomes a Pok√©mon master!
She‚Äôs your little clone. Beautiful.
OMG. The anticipation on both your guyss faces when the poke ball is rocking. That always makes you hold your breath lol!
Shhhhhh tehe
Just puts a smile on my face. <3
You can see the joy in her build up while the Pokemon is in the process of being caught!
Wow, such a beautiful father/daughter moment.  I wish he was my daddy...
I have never seen anything more genuine than that smile! Its frigging adorable! Good job OP on raising a future gamer!
Now that you caught Spearow it is time for your next challenge: ***Arceus***
You are a Lucky man
Your daughter has great tastes! She‚Äôll be a Pokemon Master before you know it :‚Äô)
Nice
\#father and daughter
This was way too cute to not watch 100 times.
Should probably tell her it only evolves into an ugly fearow. Seriously though, her reaction is awesome, she had the eye of the tiger when the ball was shaking. It's great to see how something that's so nostalgic for so many of us can be something exciting and new for the younger generation.
This was the purest reaction to a Pokemon catch I‚Äôve ever seen.
That's adorable
This is too precious!!
Life goals, right here.
I wish I could catch my first Pokemon again
What did she end up naming it?
üö® Father moment üö®
This is gonna be me as a dad for sure
Use it.
This almost made me cry. I miss these kinds of simple happiness. I haven't felt that in years.
my pre evolution
Looks like you've finally had your coffee, and you're feeling great!
cutest fucking shit i seen in awhile.
I didn‚Äôt knew how to catch Pokemon in Red version back in 1999 I always fainted them because thats what they did on the anime.

A friend that did pay attention to the tutorial corrected me after my Bulbasaur evolved into Ivysaur on the forest
So, you caught the Pikachu for her?
I kind of teared up a little, that was beautiful to watch the look of joy on both of their faces
r/pokemon
This is the only way, good job! Welcome her to the amazing pokemon club!
Make sure you delete her saved files after she gets up late one day
So wholesome!

This made me smile!
This is so cute!

Cant wait to introduce my little brother to pokemon
My fiance and I just had our first child (a girl) 3 days ago. I look forward to having this moment with her in a few years time.
Nice catch! But where do you get your brows done?
As a fairly new dad I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to do this stuff with. I love video games and I really want to share some great experiences with her.
I don't know who was more excited!
My heart cannot stand how wholesome this is
This made me grin so hard you have no idea üòÑ
This is some good, wholesome content. Thank you for sharing!
all of the idiots who get mad at pokemon forget its a game made for actual children
I'm proud he's proud she's proud everyone is proud
Thank you wholesome programmers :)
Awwwwwwww
Give your pokemon a nickname:
F-U-C-K
Right in the feels bro. Can't wait until my daughter (18mo) is old enough to show her all the thing I loved when I was younger.
I feel how happy the dad is, God bless
So cute! You guys look alike too!
Now the important question: did you nickname that spearow?
No one but YOU could be this little girl's father, when you both smile you look identical. :)
‚ÄúNice! Now nickname it StupidBirb1‚Äù
You are an awesome dad man
omg. this made me smile so big. man I am so looking forward to this with my own kids someday.
The best thing about that is that the dad showed the older games to her first. Be educated in everything kids
Proceeds to give the nickname ‚Äúbutt‚Äù
This is awesome. That feeling of catching your first Pok√©mon is pretty exciting. Also a great game to start playing as leafgreen was my first Pok√©mon game I played and loved every minute of it
This is just the best. Made my heart happy!! Can‚Äôt fake that excitement
ü•∫
THIS IS SO PURE
Congrats to your daughter! Hope she catches more Pok√©mon soon!
 Thanks for being a good dad and sharing that moment with her. 

I know it‚Äôs only a short clip but I can tell you‚Äôre a good father and this made my week and inspires me to be a good person
This sub is for cute stuff, stop complaining about the cute thing is and enjoy it. Unfollow the sub or don‚Äôt come here if you just want to troll.
What a cute little girl! I hope your family is healthy and well!
My heart just exploded. My son is 13 months old and I cannot wait to play games with him.
This warms my dead cold heart. She did great!
Very cute!
What a great moment.
Aww congrats!
I miss playing video games with my children(we are very distant)
i‚Äôm 23... i hope that by the time i have kids Pok√©mon will still be a (relevant) thing and i can share lovely moments like these w them ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
yay! so happy for you both!
This is the cutest shit ever!
The hentai addiction begins
Adorable!!!
I cannot WAIT to be doing this with my future kid!!
Firered was my first game too i miss those days
Why the fuck am I crying rn
That's the cutest diesel engine I've ever seen
That unfiltered joy really makes your day
I had the same reaction.. I started playing Pok√©mon last year at 35. Lol 

Good for her!!
My faith in Humanity has been restored. You sir are the MVP!!
Aw man.
Maybe one kid won‚Äôt be so bad
/r/wholesome
Esse jg e pra pc?
r/mademesmile
My daughter is 9 months and I cannot wait for this beautiful moment with her (assuming she likes video games and Pok√©mon - fingers crossed)!
Cute
Pok√©mon Go still gives me and so many others this feeling after 4 years of the game coming out.
Too wholesome
^shh *shh* ***SSHH***
How old is your daughter OP? I want to start playing games with my little boy but I'm not sure what age is old enough to start.
YEAH! Family game time is best
I'm having my first, a little girl in September. These things makes me so excited!:)
That‚Äôs awesome! I remember times like those when mine was little. 

Enjoy those days while they last. Before you know it she‚Äôll be glued to her phone and rarely come out of her room and nothing else will matter. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"shhh.. mom will here you... "
Lol she seems a little indifferent right up until she catches it
Annnd now she's addicted
Way to go OP! She‚Äôs real lucky to have you! This brings back memories of little me watching my late dad playing Chrono Trigger and FFIX on his PS1. I grew up loving JPRGs and I‚Äôm sure your daughter will continue loving Pokemon too! Sadly I don‚Äôt have any recordings or pictures to look back to. Anyways thanks OP for sharing such a lovely moment!
Thought you were markiplier for a sec
I know it's her destiny
Looks eatable
Chimpokemon is number 1 !!!
What is the name of this game?
I couldn‚Äôt upvote this fast enough. Awesome!!!
which pokemon game is this?
‚ÄúPress A. PRESS A. Damn it, why isn‚Äôt he telling her to **SPAM PRESS A.** IT INCREASES YOUR CHANCES OF SUCCESSFULLY CATCHING IT.‚Äù

First Pok√©mon game was Emerald on the GameBoy around 2004. I miss those days.
BRB. Gonna go make a kid.
So nobody is gonna  mention his dope ass username? 


Nice username dude!!
Amazing haha
Spearow was my first too
I didn't even knew pokemon game came first before the TV show until I got the internet.
Damn... I know this is on the front page and therefore all comments are now buried, BUT. OP, if you see this, thank you for posting. My daughter is due in September, and stuff like this is exactly what I always imagined it would be like. Thank you for posting and giving further confirmation to my dream!
