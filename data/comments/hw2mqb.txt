TIL harps can have slings so you can harp anywhere 👍🏾
I like how the deer startles her at the end. Reverse roleplay.
I honestly thought she knew it was there until she jumped after the it ran away.
I love how the doe is just so interested in the beautiful noise.
Well of course this is what happens if you dress up like a Disney Princess and play enchanting music.
Very beautiful rendition of “Sounds of Silence” I love it 

Nice job u/noomie90
I thought it was a green screen as well, but the harpist u/Noomie90 shared a wide-angle photo in the original post.

Edit: u/glodime Posted the source video in a child comment. Updating here for greater visibility. 

https://youtu.be/9Xd8xq06FCw

Even her reaction looks more authentic without the crop/zoom-in. It's truly a beautiful video. Thanks u/Noomie90 and the deer!
wonder what kind of animals would come out for some harp metallica
Is the deer taking a shit at the beginning?
The fact that they **startled each other** should be considered proof that she is an *actual* disney princess...
Lions would be unstoppable if they could only play the harp.  (also amazing job, well done)
r/harp locking and killing the post for rule breaking is everything wrong with reddit moderation
Goddamn give the awards to OP not the crossposter
"Rather than engaging in an arduous chase, the wild Noomie90 entices her prey closer with the melodious sound of Simon and Garfunkel played on a harp. Here, she catches the attention of a whitetail doe. The doe is wary, but mesmerized. She cannot help but be drawn ever closer, where she will be clubbed senseless by the heavy instrument. Suddenly, the doe's instincts overcome the fugue state induced by the siren song. She flees, living to see another day." /DavidAttenborough, probably.
The fact that she was playing the sound of silence just makes it even more amazing tbh
Honestly didn’t want that to end, it was so beautiful.
Soon as I turned the sound on my cat, zonked on my lap, perked right up. Maybe Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel know something we don’t.
the whole deer thing was awesome.  then I went to /r/harp and the post was locked because they don't allow harp covers in /r/harp ????????
It’s too bad the deer was startled by the sound of silence
Do you know how close you came to getting banged by Zeus?
*LOCKED FOR BEING A HARP COVER*

Like damn... I thought other mods were bad.
Harp level 9000
Reaction time -1
She was spooked by the deer's sounds of silence
I'm convinced deer are some kind of magical creature with powers of perception beyond normal animals that wandered into our reality from some other magical reality and got stuck... There is just something so otherworldly about them.
I love this song!!
So a cool thing about deer is that as long as you don't act like a predator (staring, sneaking, moving low to the ground, slow and unusual or stalky movements), you can walk real close to them without spooking them. If you walk at a steady pace, avoid eye contact, and act normal instead of shifty like you are trying to sneak up on them, they are often pretty fine with you just chilling out nearby or walking around the herd.
“Hey honey.. there’s a girl playing music in back of our garden! I’m gonna take a closer look”
I think animals are calmed by and drawn to mellifluous sounds
[deleted]
That was beautiful.
Hello darkness
Reminds me of the guy who’s plays Lorde on the trombone and gets swarmed by curious cows
I love how the deer is being careful not to disturb you
That could not have ended more abruptly and yet so appropriately.

Perfect timing on the dears part.
I laughed harder at this than I've laughed in a long time... take from it what you will. Everything about it was so soothing and idealistic. Then her getting startled just... LOL
Was anyone else surprised r/harp is a subreddit?
The people saying this was green-screened are gonna give me an aneurysm. She'd've either had to rotoscope vibrating strings by hand, or mime the performance perfectly with an empty harp and 3D animate strings back in later. Gah! Not make sense more then real make sense!

...It almost happened again. And I'll always be the first person to say that the world is this horrendous ball of steaming shit where nothing good ever happens, but at the same time I can admit to myself that maybe, just maybe there exist gentler corners where on seldom occasion something magical and special actually can happen. What an utter state to be in! To have to endeavor, to labor, to poke holes in that notion! Lest an ounce of wonder sneak it's merry way into your cold grey heart and cause a stirring!

Good video, heartening, 4.5/5.
Go upvote the actual post not some randoms crosspost which has more.
I'm just waiting for a bird to land on her shoulder and then it starts raining cherry blossoms and sparkles
This is so beautiful and dreamy ✨
This was worth watching alone without the deer! Who would have thought Simon and Garfunkle would sound so nice in the harp. 

The whole clip I was wondering if she noticed the deer. The end answered that question haha.
This is clearly green-screen, right?
Ah yes, Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel, Or Disturbed.
Your playing beautiful The Song The Sound Of Silence is a great song and your did amazing at it
You're my boy blue!
A) that was beautiful

B) I love the little sneaking action before the running away scene from the deer

C) Be happy it was prey and not a preditor or she would have been breakfast or lunch after the song

D) Have a nice day, I love you all :D
This is so soothing... I think everyone could do with like 5 minutes of harp a day
Is it just me, or is that doe taking a dump at the beginning of this video?
Wouldn’t it be beautiful if that deer thought about what it heard that day for a while? “I’m telling you randy, I can’t explain it. It was a sound that wasn’t like any other!”
“She speaks the old language” - deer
Good job OP crediting source, respect.
Oh deer, that was quite a shock
Guys she had s YouTube channel with less than 1k subs, we should all go sub

Let's make ybiz girl's Internet career with LOVE!
I think Snow White would have been a lot funnier if her reaction to birds landing on her had been "oh sh!t! What the f%ck is that!"
How damaged are redditors that everything has to be fake.  Even if it was it was still beautiful.
That absolutely lovely.
LOL! Thanks for sharing this great outtake.
The whole time I was thinking at what point did she notice....oh at that point lol
Damn the that deer couldn't wait just one more note before it startled her?
This looks a lot like Virginia.
Denna?
Druidic Bard dual class
She had no fuckin idear that deah was theah
The Graduate but directed by Disney
What a beautiful instrument
I turned on the sound and my kitten came over to watch with me  
  
Harps, who knew
Love how she only notices the deer as its leaving... and at a distance farther than it was at it's closest.
If a Disney movie had Sound of Silence in it, I'd tell them to shut up and take my money.
Where are the tiny songbirds braiding her hair?
Why does the repost have 30k more up votes? Come on everyone go upvote the OP too!
This made me wanna fuck aroun and get a harp.
Guess the deer was trying to find who was disturbing the sound...of silence....
pure of heart
1:03 Reality kicked in.
Deer: Oh shit thats an Apex Predator
Apex Predator: Oh shit a wild animal.
Luckily it wasn’t a Tiger.
What a cute dog
love reddit.  

OP - 5,700 updoots
 
reposter - 42,300 updoots


hehe.
good thing that was a deer and not a mountain lion,  or zombie badger.
Somebody PLEASE tweet this to Paul Simon!
You are great OP, it’s a crosspost so you can see the username of the original yet you still credit them which is very nice
Turns out hunters been doing it all wrong
That was so good, like the deer was really cool but that was the best version of sound of silence I’ve heard
At a point, I was terrified the Disney movie was going to be Bambi and that was his mother.....
This is amazing but, why did she jump like that in the end?
I love dust in the wind
Swiggity Swarp, 

He's comin for that harp.
TIL deer wag their tails with excitement/ interest like a big, sweet dog.
Sound of silence. Excellent choice.
Oh no, I remember the Disney movie about a deer, glad it ended before that part.
I don’t think I’ve ever noticed a doe having a long swishy tail. Definitely a happy tail for beautiful music.
Should continue to do so, either a little deeper into the tree line or until it attracts more animals.
Who would have thought Sound Of Silence would be an absolute banger on a harp
and the original post only got 11 k upvoted
My four favorite things: flora, fauna, music, and women
So nobody gonna talk about the deer listening to the harp?
What's the name of the song that she's playing?
She was totally surprised there at the end like she didn't even see the deer creeping up on her at first then thought it was a bear going into attack mode when she saw it in her peripheral vision.  Lol.  🤣🤣🤣
Paul Simon such a great song writer even wildlife love his music
is it just me or is this just a green screen? the quality of the person and the background seems like a mismatch, especially the head area..
Been spending too much time in r/natureismetal and expected a wildcat/leopard/alligator to come in frame any second.
The deer be like: "Artemis? Is that you?"
I love it!!
I love the double scare at the end
How many hunters are about to sign up for harp lessons?
Not bad, nothing to fawn upon.
“And on that fateful summer morn, with the rising sun at th... holy fuck what the fuck was that?!!”
Pretty sure that’s a green screen
Honestly, I see all of these people complaining that she used a green screen, but I still think it's good music tbh.
Beautiful.  Too bad about the fire
Deer thought she was a satyr.
Fucking reddit mods

* As defined by our rules, we don't allow harp covers to be posted in r/harp.

🙄
When you multiclass as a Bard Druid.
I like to think that the animals feel the music somehow, especially when played on older instruments but I’m a musician with an interest in folk instruments so of course I would right? Guess it’s silly. Still.... when I pick up a mandolin or harp I’ve noticed sometimes the rabbits and birds will come and see what I’m doing. I’ve never had that with a guitar.
am i the only one wondering if she in front of a green screen? doesnt it kinda look like it?
[deleted]
She plays with such hart
This is post got more likes than the original here’s the [link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
Music hath charms...
Anybody else tear up instantaneously? lol
Magical
Bro that thing looks heavy af how do you not have back pain
Doe: I gotta be real quiet!! this is the sound of silence!
This gives me a whole new appreciation for 'The Sound of Silence'
Awww so amazing
and if this were a horror film she would’ve been got.
Keep an eye on your parents
I never knew that animals love music. My corgi loves jazz. Just goes to show that they are the same.
if this is real it’s such a cute video omg
Immediately begins searching Spotify for sounds of silence instrumental harp
Sound of silence, nice
They both freaked out because the antagonist appeared off-screen.
Not gonna lie, looks like it'd be tough to play in a marching harp band.
TIL there are harps you can hold and play standing.
awwwww
That is a memory that no one could ever write!! Glad its on video. Its the simplest memories that we all remember.
That was awesome!
this made me tear up so bad..... like the little doe just had good associations with the harp,,, so sweet
Can you play at my wedding, please?
Does love Simon & Garfunkel. You gotta bust out zep or ccr for a buck,  but a doe will always flock to the singer songwriter type.
Goodness that was beautiful.  I loved your playing. The fact that a beautiful deer was so smitten with the song is just fabulous.  
You should play outside more often. It would be super to see who shows up 🤗⚘🌟
I had no idea there were harps you could just, carry. It makes sense I jist never thought about it. cool
This is one of the best videos I've ever seen.

I really love the way the clip ends with the notes trailing off. 

It's like visual poetry.
Looks fun to play music , imagine the cost of these knd of instrment..
I love green sleeves
Someone please photoshop that deer stealing her wallet.
You are a wonderful musician! Very cool moment.
In restless dreams I walked alone.
Uhuh uhuh um pet deer.
I wonder if animals (other than crazy parrot-like birds) enjoy nice music
Speedwagon was the true hero this entire time?
Wow, i looked over at my cat and she's like- into the music
BAMBI IT’S A TRAP!
I tested out of there
That's so beautiful! She was so interested in the sound. Today I learned that deer like harp-covered Simon and Garfunkel songs.
Hello darkness my deer friend
Wow..this video had me hypnotized. For a minute there I had forgotten about a freaking global pandemic and the chaos that's going on right now. Thank you for posting this!
I was just listening to the sounds of silence this morning. Disturbed is such a great band. That was beautiful.
My dad is going to want a harp.
You should have told him, "You can call me Flower... if you want to."
bambie.
I'd give credit to ancient cultures, not Disney.
Dude deers love Simon and Garfunkel.
I just realized I've been deer hunting wrong this whole time. No wonder I never find any deer. I need to get a harp and then learn how to play it
When I play my harp all my animals just sleep....
She looks like the lawyer chick from life in pieces
This is beautiful and you are very talented!
Was taking out a 167 Kv transformer today and a deer was also just stalking up to us about 15 feet away. I didn’t feel like I was in a Disney movie though :(. Beautiful music though
Aww that's so cute. It was nice to see something wholesome in these trying times.
both awed at that harp skill and the deer
A wild David Draiman appears
Wondeerful!
Reminds me of when I used to play guitar for cows.
Very Disney, especially right at the end.

Lucky 'twar'nt a bar. 

Woodsie critters, here I am

Back ta talk wit chew agin

Pluckin' strings among the grass and trees

Blowin' bubbles with a music breeze

Seein' if a deer

Comes creepin' out to see

It's only me

Playin' The Sound of Silence.
You can pinpoint the moment the deer recognized that it was Simon & Garfunkel.
If that was a bear this video would have ended very differently.
“Aww man, I shouldn’t have eaten that questionable mushroom.”
Lucky it was a Disney movie.  If this were NatGeo it might have been a lion.
In an adjacent universe, this ended up on /r/perfectlycutscreams
Swiggity swooty
I’ve done this with bagpipes.  It was turkeys that came and checked out the racket, though.
Goosebumps
Oh deer, I can’t believe she Disturbed The Sound of Silence.
I think it’s awesome that the deer started the whole thing by taking a shit. Sweet otherwise!

* Making a drop.
* contributing to mother nature.
* other pooping euphemisms.
Aw that was wonderful
That was brilliant.
Bloody deer I was enjoying that..
Sometimes it doe be like that.
Is this a Disturbed cover on harp?
just noticed how long deer tails are
Such a good song too.
Confirmed: fauns do exist.
Excellent choice of song!!!
Nice!
that will bring us back to doe
Music is transcendent. Especially from an instrument of such abundant clarity as a harp.
Ngl I was expecting a blue bird to land on your shoulder
It's obvious that deer has excellent taste in music lol nice to hear Simon & Garfunkel that way. Very beautiful!
With her playing The Sound of Silence, I was expecting a different ending for the deer
I love the sounds of silence
That’s just the form Tom Brady/ Ben Affleck shapeshift into when they’re depressed.
Hello darkness my old friend...
Cue the deer
Son, get my bow.
You should do a Reddit broadcast.
Loser by Splash Daddy aligns with this pretty perfectly (sound off)
I guess you could say the deer was looking for the sound of silence😎
wait, what happened in the end? did jafar show up?
If that was a coyote she'd be toast.
LOL Aww my ass the girl thought the deer was going to attack her LOL . Deer dont like Simon & Garfunkel
For some reason this reminds me of life in an mmo
That right there is a happy forest pupper
I think that deer might be disturbed...
I’m glad this wasn’t like the first scene of Bambi. What a curious cutie.
Deer hunter’s everywhere will be buying Harps after watching this.
Is it bad I cried a little when I figured out what song it was and the fact that I had to sing it one year for choir and it was my favorite song that year
 r slash harp
TIL the harp is good bait for hunting
Hehe her face when she saw it
What kind of deer is that? All of the the deer I've seen in Ontario have short stubby tails.
Maybe next season this will be the new thing hunters use to attract game? /s
what was the name of this song?
Deer are known to be huge Garfunkel fans.
Nice simon and garfunkel
Found my new deer call.
Deer are attracted to beautiful music....known fact.
THE END!!!!!
That deer wags its (oddly long) tail like a happy puppy. I have never seen that before.
How often do you think wild animals get to hear live music? If you ever get a chance to practice an instrument in the woods, make sure to pay attention for any animals trying to get a free concert out of you.
I see here that you play the harp. Tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't they just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
Forest doggo wants to know what you’re doing.
I didn't realize deer had such long tails.
Why do I feel like this deer knew the song already?
Even animals can hear and understand how beautiful it is. It’s so fascinating.
Wish I had the money to hire a personal harpist.
Anybody know the song she was playing. Sounds familiar but not sure what its is.
Original post is deleted by mod now. Can't see the video anymore :(

Edit: Nevermind, might be something on my end. Can't watch any videos on reddit, and RES just updated so it might be something there.
We just need the guy from Disturbed to show up and the end and eat everybody.
Was it shitting or pissing at the start? This is critical to determine it's perception of the quality of the performance.
The sound of silence
Now hunters gonna be out in the woods playing harps.
Bambi's bout to die
I admire those playing harp. I tried a beginner session and get sore thumbs.
I found it odd that hello darkness my old friend, which is one of my favourite tunes and carries so many negative emotions for humans was attracting the deer who of course has no knowledge of the lyrics.
I guess we all know what happened to Bambi's mother just before she started playing sound of silence
Don't mind me, saving this for my kids
Just like that scene in Little Mermaid!
If that deer had of been a tiger, you wouldn’t just be a snack, you would be lunch!  😜😋
amazing
I never realized how long a deer's tail was until its wagged.
Noticed the tail wagging excessively. Same rules as a dog wagging its tail?

(Genuine question. I have no idea.)
Sound of silience?
I legitimately forgot that harps were even a thing until just now... and now I wonder when I forgot... weed is a hell of a drug yo.
HAARP
I bet she'd bring friends if you went back for a few days.
If an old woman offers you some free fruit...

DON'T EAT IT
Beatiful
Reminds me of some moments in the Witcher 3.
The deer is a paid actor!
To the sound of silence.
You're a princess!
Don’t care what anyone says - I loved it!
What song is this?!? I almost can name it.. ugh
soothing indeed, but missing the flying birds, carrying a dress
I see it is a doe of culture
***TACKLES HER***
I thought this was gonna be the beginning of Bambi lol
Everyone liked that
This is the most harp thing I've ever seen.
What kind of harp is this? Also, where should one start to learn if one wants to take up this instrument (and can read music)? 
It’s just amazing!! :) paging u/noomie90
A great example of the orienting reflex. Very cool.
Yay
Wait is that Bambi's mother?

"Hello darkness my old friend..."
TIL you could play harp standing
Thats so cool!!!
 YOU MY BOY BLUE!!!
What a gorgeous song to do for this video
Glad it's a deer and not a large predator.
I suppose feeling that resonate, strapped to you, must be very 'in the moment'.
Other thread was locked so lemme just say to /r/harp that this video is proof that everything loves your instrument.
If you noticed at the beginning of the video, that poor doe was trying to take a dump when you started playing. You interrupted her and she came over to find out WTF.

Nice playing, though.
Yeah... right before Bambi’s mom get capped. But srlsy that was beautiful
Fucking beautiful
Wow
Saved
Omg you’re sooo lucky 😭😭😭 I love deer so sweet

Neon moon?   In every way... a beautiful video.
I’m not crying, you’re crying!

But seriously, that was one of the best things I’ve ver seen.
Aw she likes it :)
For some reason this song always reminds me of Old School.

You're my boy, Blue!
Marry me
The only thing animal-related that happens to me when I play MY harp is that my cat glares at me because my lap is occupied.
what’s the song?
Doe:  Bro I swear I saw a weird hairless ape and it was howling so beautifully...  
Other does:  bullshit bro, you probably ate some weird mushrooms again!!
Well, there's 4 credits at the Evergreen State College...
My favorite part about this is that the first 6 seconds that doe is taking a shit.
Oh , Nice Ron!!

 *Qui ne ce plantes n'a aucune chance de poussé*
Bold of her to play while Deer are nearby.
Cool!
I had a chicken that laid down and would fall asleep when I sang this song
Just Bard things
I was waiting for the bird and rabbit to come along too.
Amo muito música. É um alimento para a alma. Felizes são àqueles que se deliciam com a arte de cantar. O canto enobrece o coração, trazendo paz e sossego para a alma. A Palavra de Deus nos diz que " Todo ser que tem fôlego louve ao Senhor."
That sounds amazing and you are extremely talented. I must have more.
Its a shame the mods removed it.
That- thats a big strap on ya got there
Wow, Your good!! thats all i can reallly friknin' say!
I think she was standing between the deer and somewhere the deer wanted to go.  "Excuse me, the music is very nice and all, but could you please stand a bit to the side so that I can get pass?  Just a bit?  To the side please?  Oh forget it, I'm out of here."
Anyone know what type of harp this is?
A harp is what you play when you to want to flex on proficient guitar players . 10/10 music btw, gave me peace I longed for all day
Lol!! Her reaction was unexpected! But I LOVE the sound of silence. This was so beautiful
I thought you knew it was there and then you jumped lmao
I really don’t know what exactly it is about this, just everything about it is so perfect and meaningful to me right now? Like maybe I’m just a little bit too high right now or something, but the choice of song juxtaposed with the quiet of the forest and the deer, and then she’s wearing black, the mutual startling at the end, like she could enter it into a contest as a short art piece.
I needed this today x see, it is a beautiful world!
Deer be like: is that u Jesus?
I like how the deer is taking a crap in the beginning
You are a beautiful harpist thank you so much for sharing
Is your name Diana?  Or Artemis?
What happened at the end there? You got scared?
That deer was like, “Oh it’s Snow Wh...wait, is that Snow...yeah that’s her. Hey Snow...oh shit! That’s not her! I’m out!”
That was beautiful!
Bambi in the background
Wow that song sounds great on a harp! Do you have a recording of yourself playing the full song?
Love that song!
Orpheus, is that you?
So freakin beautiful
She was like a deer in the headlights type scared
It looks like a human but it's not screaming at everything for no reason.
I was wondering if she knew it was there. Then the end happened.
*Ah-choo*
I’ve never heard this song before on a harp and I must say I am in love🥺
everyone gangsta till the zombie deer show up
Gosh dangit this is so cute. I wish this much cuteness could enter my life.
Diane
It ran away after it found out Disturbed covered sound of silence.
Why was the most shocking part the fact that the deer had a long tail and was wagging it? Like I thought they had short Bambi tails that stuck up when they’re spooked!? I’ve been lied to my whole life!
Hello darkness my only friend. Love it
The even look like a Disney princess
bird didn’t land on her shoulder tho
Dammit! That deer scared the harpist and fled; now i won’t be able to hear the rest.
You just blew the doe's mind. She was like yeah I'll risk my life to see something this amazing.
This girl had no idea she was a princess
Wow so cute 🥺
I love that song!
I feel like I need to learn the harp now lol
Hello darkness my old friend...
"the fuck they doin over there."
It's amazing to me the wild deer approached her while listening to the music.  But how do you not notice a deer out in the open behind you while you're setting up your camera and getting ready to play your harp?
This was oddly soothing...
Harpist- plays The Sound of Silence

Deer- Hahaa you didn’t hear my silence!
I just realized that they are playing *the sound of silence*
play Bridges and Balloons!
The “hello darkness my old friend” is a nice touch
hopefully you finish the song and upload the full version !

that was great.
Beautiful song choice.
If deer were predatory, she'd be a goner!
The sound of silence
Ur gorgeous ❤️
That unexpected ending lol.
[all I wanna do is see you turn into](https://youtu.be/1Oj9WEHjWfg)
Who's she it brought tears to my eyes. So beautiful.
It wanted to eat while listening to music! Lovely video
It looks so fake until you see the YT video
Ooo ah ah ah ah
I digress it’s for sure my favorite video ever
Who knew deer were attracted for anthems of dystopian revolution !!
Are we sure this isn’t Poppy?
Ironic that she's playing sound silence
If that was Bambi’s momma, she got off light.
I was thinking 'some peculiar sound in the song might drawing the deer' and the moment she startled lol she's also a deer
cute
This song sounds so familiar...
Deer stalking
More like Disney movies were based off of this
That deer can relate, he just lost his mom
Fake as fuck! u/GSIX96
> Hello! As defined by our rules, we don't allow harp covers to be posted in r/harp. Please post your harp covers to r/BestHarp. Harp-y Redditing!

Song?
On the other hand, she's lucky it wasn't a predator. Music skills 10/10, survivability 3/10.
Harp went Brrrrrrrr
That deer is either peeing or pooping at the very beginning, lol
That was funny as fuck
Was that song "the sound of silence" if so that is so dope
Ok but what kind of deer is it?
 Amazing!

Also, that there’s a Battle Harp!
This very same thing happened to me. Except I saw the deer and walked up as close as they let me go and I started singing circle of life. The baby deer was we its ears and running around me, I grew up in the country and this is the most beautiful nature experience aside from being with my nephew
Imagine if that was a mountain lion instead of a deer.
Awe
How do I upvote this more?
Is it weird that now I am thinking at Russia a gopnik and a bear dancing hardbass
Well guess I gotta learn the Harp by deer season.
Me : Uhhh that's not a harp, harps are normally smaller 

OP : You calling me a fuckin lyre?
This is adorable! Meanwhile, my own cat hates the sound of my guitar and will run away from it  when I even pick it up hahaha
Beautiful!
Deer: play wonder wall
thinking about how wild animals have never heard music before :/
Why are there more upvotes on this than on the actual post? Not saying I'm against upvoting this(because I did), but we need to upvote the original post more.
And that’s why harpists don’t make big bucks.
Haha that  was great
What's all the black stuff on the left side of the deer? And why doesn't the other side have it
really amazing music.👍👍
The deer was probably curious about the sound and wantex to see what it was
At least it wasn't a bear.
It was the dress.
Is it just me or does it look like she’s edited into the video? I don’t know also the lighting seems a little off
"what the- oh heck yeah, I love Simon and Garfunkel! Wait is that a camera?!"
I played this and both my dogs came up and started licking my phone.
It looked so happy
I laughed so hard when the girl freaked out hahah
Cool but I was actually hoping for birds 😂
Who really was the deer?
Those peripherals tho
Thank you for the Simon & Garfunkel
“now do classical gas!”
I thought she was a magic being levitating a harp until I realized there’s a fancy strap holding that shit.
The SILENCE...
Serious question: do animals comprehend music? Or is it just sounds to them?
Gotta love green screens...
Glad it wasn’t a predator. Terrible reaction time
Ha ha too many sound effects and the sound kept playing after the strings stopped being plucked ha
Is this not just a green screen?
You have a power
Is it just me or does this look fake. The lighting is weird
“Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping”
Now she just needs a bigger, poofier dress and unexplainably big eyes
“What have you turned my brothers into?!?”
If an animal isn’t afraid of you, it’s generally a good idea to run. At least to me. Rabies are no joke.
Suspiciously, thousands suddenly enroll in harp lessons across rural Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Of course the deer thought all was well, all it heard was the sound of silence! Should probably get a pair of glasses, though
Strap on harp! Lol I’ve been watching too many “videos”
I love this song but I can't remember the name of it for the life of me, can someone help me??
This girl plucks.
The deer probably is thinking it's hallucinating or high! 

The others will never believe this!
That was beautiful..
Fitting song for how it ended.
I'm so glad the Disney movie in question wasn't the start of Bambi. I was expecting that deer to get got.
I think this is the best way ever to end my evening on. thank you!
Awesome Sound of Silence cover
Guess he was a fan of Simon and Garfunkel
What is this song called it sounds so familiar yet I can’t seem to remember it
Who knew deer liked Simon and Garfunkel.
The deer is a Simon and Garfunkel fan
Why are y’all awarding the cross post???? Award the original ffs
I actually said “aww”. Mission accomplished!
so talented she is <3
Amazing😍
TIL deer like the sound of silence 😂
Not sure if title pings notifications for users but u/Noomie90 should see how blown up this is on this subbreddit too!
Deer are such smart, curious friendly animals
Sad that the original post only got 11k upvotes, go upvote it people!
You look like a disney princess and it's too bad your little buddy ran off :)
I guess "Sound of Silence" is good no matter how you play it!
This is an amazing song in general but you playing it with the harp and in that setting was really magical. I’m not surprised the universe made that happened and now I’m getting all hippy like. But seriously, from woman to woman, you looked and played like a goddess and I think that attracted some serious earthly vibes. Very cool!
What song is this?
My cat perked up from his nap to listen. Keep up the good work! Xoxo!
Awwwww that's the cutest thing ever!
That was quite lovely
Can you upload a video of you playing the whole song on the harp? I want to fall asleep to this. Do you have a music channel anywhere?
What's this song?
I really hope one of my kids will learn the harp. Such a beautiful instrument.
Lovely.
Damn, it’s kinda disappointing that the original post got much less upvotes than this one
Adds harp to my list of things I’d like in a woman.
Everyone knows Bambi ❤️❤️❤️ Paul and Art!!
Man that woulda spooked me too. Jesus Christ hahaha what a curious lil fellah 😄🤗
Awesome!
Did you kissed him and it turned in to a real handsome man ?
Song?
WOW! Watched this while high! 😮
Meanwhile, if I start singing and then stop before my cat wants me to she screams at me until I start singing again. I am just here for her entertainment.
Was I the only one really hoping it wasn't gonna be Bambi?
Who is this harpy? The deer probably.
The deer Harper.
The song and the wiggling tail. So beautiful
More like oracle of seasons
lol was it pooping in the very beginning??
Harp strapped that's a new gangster haha
I'm sorry, prlly gonna get downvoted.  But shes clearly standing under studio lighting.  This is fake

Like why can't we see her feet?  Why don't we hear the deer, why don't we hear her feet on grass?  Why would she be standing on the right side of the screen?
😍😍
I’m just glad is wasn’t a Texas chainsaw massacre come true.
That has got to be the straight up weirdest thing that deer will ever see.
I'm convinced that deer actually just wanted to scare the fuck outta her.
u/toubm
Give the awards the actual OP, not the dude who cross posted it.
Anyone else so used to searching for the twist that you were expecting a slam cut to bambi's mother?
... share
Are you playing sound of silence on a harp? I enjoy your talent very much.
Sounds of silence, wonderful song. I was playing on a grinnell brothers piano from my grandmother, and looking at john Denver sheet music, never played strings, woodwinds and percussion. Memories
I can't here the music, even though the sound is on full blast.
I love this. I love wild animals. You are amazing!!
I like how she strolled up, took a shit and then decided to listen more closely
Real recognize real
You look very purple
TIL harpists are prey animals.
