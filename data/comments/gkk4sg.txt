That is adorable!
You pet has a pet now!
I've never seen a dog play with a kitten like that...it's so darn cute and sweet! ‚ù§
This is so cute! I don‚Äôt want to be that guy, and you probably don‚Äôt, but please don‚Äôt leave any strings our when they‚Äôre not supervised. I had a wonderful cat die after he swallowed a string. He never chewed them or ate anything stupid until then, and the freaking thing was over two feet long. I didn‚Äôt know it was gone, and by the time he was acting sick a full week later, they couldn‚Äôt save him in surgery. I just don‚Äôt want it to happen to anyone else!
I wish I had a dog
I love how he figured this out. Probably tried to get the little guy to play with him with his dog toys for a while and found out this is the only way he will be interested enough to play! So cute
OW, MY HEART
I made a noise no man should make.  That is adorable.
Awh, that is so cute.
On a side note to everyone, please don't leave your pets alone with string, especially if it isn't attached to anything. Many pets, like cats, will eat the string. This can cause them to die. Many cats wind up dead around Christmas time after eating the low hanging tinsel off the tree. :/ Very fun to play with, but always be careful. And hair ties. Some cats devour those.
Sweet big brother ‚ò∫Ô∏è
What breed is your doggo?
When he gets down on his belly and looks her right in the face, so adorable.
Veterinary surgeon here. Linear foreign bodies are life threatening in dogs and cats (they bunch up the intestines as they try to move through, often perforating the bowel causing septic peritonitis)... Be sure you are supervising, and better yet - find something they can't swallow! Cute but hard to ignore the threat when I watch this üò¨
Love how your dog is so thoughtful.  Clearly he's happy for the family addition.  Congratulations!
The dog is obviously cat fishing.
I think dog wants to play tug. Seems like he knows he will need to be easy and let cat win but wants to play anyway.
My dogs do the same exact thing! Sometimes my younger one will play with it like she's a cat lol
This is too cute! My dog tries to get my cat to play with her tug rope. It‚Äôs incredibly adorable.
When cats swallow string, they simultaneously try to digest and regurgitate it, sawing their intestines apart.
Such a clever cute boy.
Just have to be sure he doesn't swallow strings like that, they can get tangled in the intestine.
That¬¥s heartmenlting! Just please make sure the strings are never left around when there¬¥s no one supervising, for safety measures:-)
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs been said but as your friendly neighborhood reddit vet, please be really careful with strings and even hair ties. Scary things, surgery, and sadness can happen. They are too cute! I hate to be that guy :/
Please keep track of every play string. It cost me $10,000 to get string removed from my cat‚Äôs tummy.
A lot of dogs are smart enough to limit their strength to match their playpal. I was going to meet some friends at a summer house last summer, and two of them were bringing their dogs. One is a large lab and the other is a considerably smaller Max Russel terrier. I bought a dog toy to bring, consisting of a tough rope, made as a figure 8 so that two dogs can play tug, or you can play tug with one dog.

The lab was the only one there when I arrived, so I played with it, and we both had a merry old time. When the terrier arrived, I threw the toy to the lab who happily ran over to the terrier with it. Lab was holding back most of her strength, just play-pulling with the terrier for at least an hour. I thought it was amazing.
I love how gentle he was with his mouth when he grabbed the string while it was close to the kitten‚Äôs body ugh
Hate to be that guy. But strings are actually pretty dangerous for cats and kittens. I don‚Äôt want to link to an article saying so but you can find an article saying so. They can swallow them. Sorry ‚Äî cute picture
Naw 
Watch out for ingestion of strings. Cause a trip to the vet to remove from the bowels would be expensive
We have the same dog dude
This dog is a pet owner
They‚Äôre adorable but I really just wanted to say that I love your fireplace!
This looks like an absolute clone of my dog
Excuse me, I ordered a moderately cute video. But I got this unbearably cute video instead and I would like a refund on account of me being unable to do anything else besides watch this video. Please, my wife left me.
I have an extremely similar looking dog! Do you know what breed he is?
More like, your dog and cat are playing two different games.  He wants to play tug, she wants to play swat.  And neither is providing the full game to the other.  She wants him to swing his head  back and forth, and he wants her to hold the shoe lace in her mouth and tug so he can pretend to be pulled (if generous) or pull, if playful.
Oh... My... God. What a sweeeeeet and smart boy! I‚Äôm in blissful disbelief over how amazing this is. You‚Äôre SO lucky!! You go, you!!!
He just really wants the kitten to play tug of war with him haha
The title is wrong. He found a string so he could play *with* the kitten, not just so the kitten could play. Makes it even more adorable
oh, my heart <3
Do you know what the breed is??? My dog is indentical and I've never found out
r/kittypupperlove ‚ù§
Don't let your cat eat string! You will end up having to pull it out of its butt... And that is NOT pleasant.... I hear....
This baby looks like my little nugget <3

Who has strings lying around in their house?
Dog: if I don‚Äôt do this it‚Äôs going to attack my tail.
Your kitten isn't yours anymore.  It's you dogs kitten now. ‚ù§
What a good boy.
What kind of dog is this? Mine looks almost identical and we don‚Äôt know what he is
That‚Äôs so sweet

We couldn't figure out how my sister's dog kept getting rubber bands to bring us for fetch until we found out the cat was standing on a desk, opening the top drawer, and pulling out rubber bands to drop to the floor for the dog because the cat was *closing the drawer after.* She would also steal hair ties out of a drawer in the bathroom.
He‚Äôs the hero we need, not the one we deserve.
trying to play tuggies with the kitten
I love how gently he picks it up when it's near the kitten, like he doesn't want to accidentally hurt his best friend <3
I need insulin after watching this!üíó
I‚Äôve been ugly crying and binge-eating icecream‚Äî this made me smile üíï

Cuteness overload!!! Awww
This is the sweetest, most wholesome thing üò≠ Looks like he really loves his new friend!
Rob Spaghetti here, and boy am I pissed.
My sister's pittie actually does this exact same thing with us (and the new puppy)! If he lets go, she gives it right back to him, and she always picks up toys to share with him
At that point it‚Äôs nice bot
Aw he loves kitty!
Such a sweet dog!
Oh my god. What love. This makes my heart explode.

I love this, so much! Animals are the best
He is the sweetest. What a loving gentle thing.
Cute!
Plot twist he is trying to strangle him and make it look like an accident
Funny.  I have a 90 lb dog and brother and sister cats, all about 8 years old.  They are so funny.  The female is so skittish but totally unafraid of the dog, while he is so aloof to her.  She'll run from anyone, but will approach him and stand up to bump his chin with her head.
This is what everyone needs right now.
I don't see cute. I see smart. Smart dog for learning how to always have a friend to play with, even when owner is busy with something & even though they have different interests. 

Dogs love having something that someone else wants. 

Cats love string.

Took this dogs big brain to figure this out.
Too cute
What a super-sweet pup!
Dog tries to strangle kitten with string.
Sooo cute!
I can‚Äôt handle this.
Omgggggggg

In the backyard there is a snake -- they are thinking of catching and eating it.

My word, the look of love at the end!

Oh no you need this string watch...see so fun to watch you play with this snake
Hes so cute. My dog carries our cat around in her mouth by the top of the head. Never once hurt the cat, and the cat seems content as can be with the deal.
OMG, so cute!!!!!
Mean while our dog tries to eat our cats....

Oh to be young again!

So innocent, and so full of loving trust...
Aww, that's adorable, just don't let them swallow it, my cat accidentally swallowed a string one time and he had to get a surgery to remove it
Is it just me or does it look like "parent dog/wolf giving its puppy food/practice toys" behavior? Aww dog and its baby
Those are not tears. Those are not tears. Those are not tears. Those are not tears.

Best cat dad!
He has just leant that he can trick this creature into a playmate if he waves around a piece of string. It's all about the play.
It's coming out of your fav sweater.
That right there is classic Cat Fishing.
That is so adorable! What a wonderful boy you have! What is his name?
Nice
That‚Äôs the Goodest Boi
How adorable
The dog is trying to tie it around the cat's neck
That's great to see!
god he loves that kitten
He‚Äôs trying to use it as a garrote
I wouldn‚Äôt leave string around if you‚Äôre not watching the kitten (the dog too probably). They can eat it and as you can guess string is better outside of your cat‚Äôs intestines than inside them. I had to pull some yarn from one of my cat‚Äôs throat before and it was gross. We don‚Äôt even let him play with yarn or thread when we supervise him because he‚Äôll try to eat it and fight us when we stop him.
How is this even a thing?  How can a boy be that sweet and good and wonderful??
That‚Äôs overwhelmingly adorable.
After looking at yet another ‚Äúlast pic with my dead dog‚Äù post, this made me feel a lot better
Omg he‚Äôs not just finding strings, he is playing with her!!  My heart.
Gaahh!! My heart can't handle this!

How does a dog get that smart!?! My dogs would not do this. They do stare at the walls sometimes though.
I spent Christmas at my boyfriends family‚Äôs place and whilst unwrapping gifts I found a big red thread ribbon. I remember thinking ‚Äúman if I was a cat I‚Äôd love that ribbon‚Äù, and realizing they were just gonna throw it away I took it back for my roommates cats. Best present I ever got them! They still play with it for hours!
Made my morning! x
Oh dear god, what a sweet pupper. I just want to hug him :)
Omg I love them
Awwww, that's one of the sweetest things I've ever seen.  Love it. üíû
For a second it looked like he was trying to make a noose around the kitty's neck.

But in all seriousness, that is too cute. I'm sure they both have fun playing together.
Hello yes I‚Äôd like two of each, please
Too short! I coulda watched hours of them doing their thing together.
to paraphrase James Carville, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from tp
He clearly couldn‚Äôt stop you
Omg, he really IS the sweetest boy!
Did he get that idea from watching you play with the kitten or did he just invent it himself?
That‚Äôs the most sweetest thing I‚Äôve seen! You can tell he just adores her the way he looks at her.
AH christ I can't even process that right now
This dog looks exactly like my brothers old dog! If I knew how to link a picture I would gladly pay the ‚ÄúDuke‚Äù tax lol

My roommate's dog is the same way, he starts throwing around his tug rope to get my cat to come out and watch/play. He's 2 and mixed with some giant cattle hound but he's such a sweet thing that just wants to play and be loved.
More please :)

Looks like the cat savaged his ears. Poor pup.

Holy shit this is the sweetest thing.
That's what you think. He's actually trying to make a noose to hang him.

I have my parents dog who is about 6 or 7 year old Morkie who THINKS he's the boss of the house

Then I have a two year old boxer who just crashes into everything.  The cat smacks the youngest in the face only when the oldest is around to make sure he knows who's really in charge

That kitten is his. Not yours, his.
Dogs know how to use tools.  SCIENTISTS JUST DISCOVERED! (what most people already know).
The dog wants a friend, but the kitten only wants a string. Sad.

Please be careful. Strings can entangle the soft tissue of a kitten or cat's intestines and they can die.

Pretty sure he's trying to tie a knot around the kitty
Breed of the dog?

Us: awwwwww look at them getting along cuuuuuteeeee
What breed is he
Sweetness boy EVER....
I want a dog and a cat have them to be best friends
After the dog gets it he‚Äôs like: it‚Äôs okey here you have it
This is very intelligent for a dog.  He recognizes the kitten is going to need to develop it's hunting skills.  I don't think he perceives it as just passing the time indoors.
Imagine if you lived your life with nothing human to interact with.  Something you encounter/live with seems human like. You try and it kinda works. Cute video unless dogs/cats posess self awareness and get lonely about the lack of their own kind.o
Was in a LTR that had adopted a female pup.   My dog would treat her like a little sister.   

He would give WWE quality acting (obviously fake to us-but not to her) letting her win wrestling matches or playing tug of war.  

We haven‚Äôt been together in years.  He never took to another dog like that again.
Look at this sweet baby!
My dog would just eat it.
I think he is having more fun than the kitten.

I love pets. I had a white dog pomeranian from 1990 to 2008. He died of mouth cancer at the age of 18. After that, I could not dare to keep any dog. Also since I have to keep shifting between India and America, it has become difficult to maintain the dog.
Your dog seems very happy with his pet kitten. He's obviously enjoys owning a cat. Usually it's the other way around, with the cat that owns everyone else.
Awesome I seriously watched like 10 times my sweet old man always leaves like 5 kibbles in his bowl for his younger sister.
Awwwwww they look like super good pals
So cute <3
He just wants to take his pet cat for a walk.  üêà
This literally made me say "Aww!" out loud. Involuntarily. May just be the cutest thing I've ever seen.
My cat would like to borrow your dog for a day (or a lifetime). She lives for the string.

THIS IS THE CUTEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN what a smart boy learning how cats like to play, most dogs just try to box and play rough which cats hate 
10/10 am jealous
Do not let cats play with strings that they can swallow, it's very dangerous.

My cat ate a shoe string and I had to get an ultrasounds and force him to puke it up.  Strings can cause internal perforations and abrasions as lengths of the string travel at a different rate than the other.
He looks like a sweetheart.
He's just desperately hoping the kitten won't grow up to be a total dick to him. Poor fella never stood a chance.

Just kidding, this is so adorable I melted into a puddle.
Awww , this looks like my dog.
I always get excited when a pup looks like my pup.
I wonder of i will do that when i have children
