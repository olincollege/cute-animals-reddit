I THINK MET WOMBAT TWO WEEKS AGO WITH HIS FOSTER FAMILY OMG! 

He was the sweetest softest boy and I'm so happy he found a home. 

Am I right in assuming you're in Vic in Australia? He was going for a road trip down to Hamilton (I think) with his foster mate the pug. I had my six month Kelpie with me and they had a sniff and said hello at their pee stop in Inverleigh.
That's the most adorable little pup holy shit
Wombat seems like a perfect name to fit those ears. 
A synonymous name indeed 
I'm getting the impression that everyone in Australia knows this dog.  Did he used to wander the countryside helping stragners ,living on handouts and having zany adventures?
Hey guys, this has really blown up.

Just have to clarify a few things after sorting by new and reading through most of the comments.

Wombat is *not* my dog yet. I’m still travelling in a different country, and have applied to adopt him when I get home. I’m crossing my fingers a better applicant doesn’t come along in the next week before our meet and greet, because the current foster parent can’t care for him from one single day after I get home. She might not want to put all her eggs in my basket, and then my dog doesn’t get along with Wombat, or something like that, and then she needs to adopt him out in a day or give him up to a shelter. I’m really hopeful, but it’s not guaranteed yet. 

I just wanted to share because he’s one of the most gorgeous pups I’ve ever seen!
Too cute. Kids and wives at home will get jealous that’s why. 
Stumpy tail? I have a Smithfield heeler myself, her intelligence and personality blow me away every day, hope you guys have so much fun together 
Errmygawd those ears! 
Cuddly, but muscular
"Stop wooking at me"
MORE! GIVE US MORE PICTURES! 
They screwed you over this is not a wombat!
Is this real? Can't tell I've never seen an animal with a bunny body and a dog face.
That is definitely a cute pup.  
I thought it was a donkey at first glance.
This is clearly an animal. 
He looks like a homeless man 
Evert time I see an ACD on Reddit, I get so giddy! We have a year old terror named River and my boyfriend and I were laying in bed when I showed him this. He instantly says, "I knew Wombat was a heeler when I saw the look that he was giving the camera." Ours gives us the same look when she's judging. 
Wish I had multiple reddit accounts to give multiple upvotes.
I imagine the look on his face a week, a month, a year from now - is going to be much different. What a beautiful guy. You two kids have fun!! :-) 
Ohhhhh my heart ❤️. My old dog was a blue heeler, smartest dog that ever lived and three times as loyal. We had him for 18 years and loved every minute of it, broke my dad’s heart so badly when he finally passed I think he’s still not over it. Neither am I tbh. Congratulations on your new pup! You’re in for a looooot of high energy puppy shenanigans and a lot of good memories.  
naww that nervous little side eye! What a cutie. I've got a BC x Red Cattle dog and he's sharp as a tack. I'm sure Wombat will be a bright pup too.

Invest in a good ball launcher ($2 from Kmart!) - great to give them a good run! 
Wombat is a major cutie. A real Boofle Woofle.
I just woke up and I’ve received a message from the ‘shelter’ and want to clear some things up, because I misunderstood their service and wasn’t correct on some details of Wombat’s past.

Wombat *was* dumped in a pound, but he and his 4 siblings were rescued from that pound by Waggin Tails Animal Rescue. They are a rescue and foster service, not a shelter. Once they rescue an animal, that animal will never see the inside of a shelter again, but will be fostered out to loving homes until a permanent adoptive solution is found. Wombat would not be surrendered to a shelter if not adopted by me or anyone else, he would be found a new loving foster family or adoptive family.

The name ‘Wombat’, I also mistakenly credited his foster carer. Waggin Tails came up with that too, and named the whole litter after native Australian animals. 

I’ve included a pic of Wombat and two of his siblings being rescued by Waggin Tails so this comment (hopefully) gets some exposure, and they get the credit they deserve as an Animal Rescue rather than a shelter.  https://i.imgur.com/a0FBIs1.jpg 
Give him kisses for me!!! ☺️
That dog is going to be both amazing and a pain in the ass.
Why is this rabbit disguising as a dog?
Wombat!?! That’s a weird ass name for a dog but for some reason I love it haha. 
We're gonna need some happy Wombat updates, OP! 
How old is he? I guess he never grew into his ears but O H  M Y  G O D isn't he cute!! If you'll create an Instagram please drop it so we can see more of Wombat! 
Hey OP, just wanted to stop by and say that


I WOULD DIE FOR WOMBAT
That's a good name for that dog. He's clearly a god damn wombat. 

&#x200B;
سلام عليك🖐انا هولفنان المغرب🇲🇦اسمي عبد الصمد احسني عيوني من بلادينا عين الشعير 🇫🇷🎻🎶🎵🎼🎬🎨🎞📺🎥

He's so freaking cute!   
and what a fitting name.
He wasn’t rescued because you are his person and he needed to wait for you. Look forward to seeing updates please as Wombat grows! 
He was waiting for you .
Wombats eat roots and leaves.
a whole office just "Awwed" for Wombat and hope that good puppera has the most wonderful life it deserves
This is the best name match for a pup I've evet heard I love Wombat so much.
Dem ears.... insta-adopt!
I'm gonna need weekly updates on Wombat. How does he like the new home? Will his head ever catch up to his ears? Can he hear my thoughts? These questions and more need answering.
He looks like he could chew your house down. That scared skittish look, super cute, but I’d bet he could be destructive. Give him lots of love and attention, and stuff to do “work”.
Aw any more pictures!? He’s so cute! 
So nice to meet you! Hope you live happily together :) 
What a good boi
What a cool looking dog!!!!!!!
nice
Hello sweet little wombat 😍 may you have a blessed life 🙏❤
He's got a Scrappy Doo look about him
You've got one of the best, smartest boys on your hands! My blue heeler keeps me busy, but I love her so much. She is the best dog I have ever had in my life. Get lots of puzzle toys to keep him busy and using his brain.

You might have to break the herding habit. Haha! Blue heelers are velcro dogs and she attached to me very quickly. When she was a pup, she would try to herd me back from the door when I would leave from work. I have a couple of scars on my ankles from her needle teeth.
I'm not trying to embarrass you OP, but that's not a wombat.
Obviously he was waiting for you. Thats the only answer i got. 
I wish to pat this dog
I know I'm a confirmed Kmart fiend when I noticed the Kmart blanket on your seat 😂 

I am also confused as to why Wombat wasnt adopted the moment he arrived! What a fricken cutie!

Happy adoption day you two!  
I Approve!
Well I can't see how anyone wouldn't have falling in love at first sight with this lil' pupper.
Oh how adorable! Congrats on the new addition!
Thats a really really good name for him!  
Wombat, meet me. Someone who loves dogs. I therefore conclude I love you ❤️
How did you get him to pose like that? He’s perfect
Best name ever! 
Oh my. He could be the cutest puppy ever. 
So much cuteness
He's almost human. I need him. 
Need more photos he's a really handsome little fella, you are really lucky!
Excellent name for such a gorgeous nugget
Ugh cattle dawgs.. the love of my life!!
Awesome looking pup. I love the colour.

&#x200B;

Australia? I only ask because I've got exactly the same blanket on my sofa for my dog right now.
Those eyes are all cried out. 
Look at that ... he’s silently judging you already. Buy em any treat he wants.
He reminds me of Scrappy Doo
Heeler mix of some sort? That's going to be a great dog.
Stop chopping onions damn
I don't think you could have chosen a more apt name. Beautiful little critter. Well done, OP!
Had 2 have that
Looks like he's gonna bite some ankles.

Have one that looks just like him but black and white.  Mean as hell to anyone that's not me.
Looking forward to a pic of wombat by Op next year referencing this post
We need more updated pics when you get some free time,he is adorable.
This is possibly the most adorable dog, I don't know what is
Just leave him there, he gets food and water and play time and be completely free of all worries
Little pug is internationally famous and has no clue 
Just enjoy your dog without virtue signaling. 
u/StygianFuhrer post this in r/AustralianCattleDogs
They will love him!
I don‘t mean to be dramatic and creepy but I think I love him. 
😍🤗
Hi, Wombat! It all gets better from here buddy.
Those eyes . I got dust in my eye. 
This puppy is adorable.
Wow, he's awesome! :D looks like a good buddy <3
That jacket is plotting something
I hope this isn't your first dog, and I hope you've read up on acds if this is your first acd. These dogs are intense, but amazing. Please give this beast the attention, love, and lifestyle it deserves. Godspeed 
Like a disney character come to life.
A dog named Wombat...
Such a beautiful dog. Just look at his fur. Absolutely incredible. One of the cutest dogs I’ve seen.
Because he was waiting for you. 
You lucked out getting that floofy boi.
He’s precious and the shade factor is high with him.  Look at those eyes!!! So happy you found each other.  
Is this a rabbit a dog or some kind of kangaroo??
Looks like the head of a grown dog stuck on a puppy body!
Can you start a Instagram page for him plz and update us on him . 
Applicable Phish Song: https://youtu.be/qAcdn5Y9GAI
I love his big ears 😍 
Omg i know ,i would of took him in a second!!!
Hes adorable 
That is going to be a good dog....You can just tell its a sweet dog.
He looks scared. You’re safe now buddy.
What race is it? Its awesome!!! 
What a beautiful blue heeler mutt! 
He’s too cute!!!!!!! 
a small, cute wolf.
This is the coolest, prettiest looking dog. So jealous. 
Blue heelers are a lot of work and you need a lot of patients. But they are the best dogs once they get past the constant nipping at your ankles.
OMG OMG OMG

Good name.
Wombat?! That is the best name ever! I love him!
Yeah. Imma gonna need you to go ahead with full on scritches, scratches, kisses and cuddles. That should be accompanied with reassuring little "Wombat" about what a "good" pupper he or she is. 
Bc blue healers have a lot of energy and a lot of people really dont wanna deal with that. My brother had one who wound up going to a friends instead bc that dog was psychotic and my brother didnt have a large enough yard or enough time for such a high energy dog. Plus their other dog they had first hated her guts 
Hello Wombat, my name is u/DarthFlgmdrag
I think it's a dog not a wombat
Is that a blue healer? Can we has more pictures? :D
He has very human eyes and it’s kinda weirding me out
Had to have that!
This is the cutest dog I have ever seen (and I have two of my own... shh don’t tell them) 
Had to have that!
I can't even with this little guy. Give him a good home/life, OP.
CUZ HE WAS WAITING FOR YOU OF COURSE!!

Duh! :P 
I've been trying to post a photo but it won't let me, anyone know why ?
Cute pup.... but those eyes...   "He's seen things....."
Had to have that! It's a Wombat!  

&#x200B;

Call him Abe Vigoda as a nickname. 
Looks like stitch!
Posts like these make me sad for the dogs at shelters that happen to be ugly or don't have interesting features and don't get adopted.
Hello Wombat!
He looks like a wombat
Omg thank you soo much for adopting. I can see the fear in this pups eyes.. little does he know its only gonna get better and better from here!
He was meant for you!
I think Wombat is the PERFECT name for this little guy. He is so damned cute - THOSE EARS! He kinda reminds me of my old girl with his ginormous ears to head ratio =P
He looks like the real life version of a disney dog that doesn't exist yet. 
Big ear boy can hear food chewing more than  10 feet away I swear....
What breed / mix is he ?
that's not a wombat, that's a dog.. and yes I've played wombaty doggy before.
I would like to order one Wombat, please.
She/He too cute :3
To be honest this is a future meme picture 😂
What a handsome little man! I'm glad you got him!
My dyslexia kicked in I thought his name was Wal-Mart.
Not gonna lie he looks like he’s gonna be sketchy.
Almost ttoooo cute a look ;-)

"I was rescued the second I arrived at the shelter... 15 times... Soon I will be immediately rescued for a 17th time..."

"What happened to the 16th time?"

"They will soon find out..."

*Knife unsheathing sound

*Dun dun duuuuuuuuunnnn
Thank you for adopting and not buying. 
Because when people went in they chose something else. 
He looks judgmental. I don't need that from a dog, I get plenty of that from my cat. 
Well there’s the fact that he looks like a giant rat.
10/10 name. hope he [poops cubes.](https://i2.wp.com/ascienceenthusiast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/71e06ffb-wombat-poop-social.jpg?fit=758%2C401&ssl=1)

OMG.
Excellent name for the perfect pupper. Congratulations, he is adorable. ♥️
What a unique looking pupper! Not sure who's luckier, you or him. Wishing you both many years of happiness!
You made me say it! You made me say aww! 
So cute!! Is he getting along well with your other dog? 
Sup dog
Great name and beautiful dog
OMG he's so adorable!   


And Wombat is an awesome name!! :D
That's a Combat Wombat right there
as if he was saying "who are you, where are you going to bring me"  

Im a dog
So cute and good
Im scared and born in rough hood
New home i shall seek
And in it i must sleep

Fuck my inspiration ended someone extend this shit 
Yeah I agree. Unique and adorable. I’d have nabbed his little self. 
he looks like ROUS
I am completely and utterly in love!
What a sweet baby!
I love you Wombat
Jesus, that's cute!
Gday Wombat. 
He was rescued when the shelter took him in.

He was given a home when you came along.
Perfect name
He is sooooo cute!
I can't run but I can walk much faster than this little cuteness bomb 
He's gorgeous!
Great name 
Wassup wombat jack
That right there is a beautiful doggo
Perfect name
He looks like a cartoon pencil sketch!
Collar looks a little tight.
Your pups eyes are eerily human. If you told me it's a human in a dog costume I'd believe it.
Why does your dog look like a grey scrappy doo ? 😂😂
Beautiful boy!!! It seems as though you are going to have the great life that you deserve. 
heelers are the best pups! ♥️
Those ears are magical, but pleeez get a harness to click into that seatbelt if you don't already :)
He’s adorable 
It's that wee mischeivous glint in his eye. The one that says "hello, I'm trouble but I'm far too cute to get angry with". One sorrowful droop of an ear and you will be his slave.
Holy crap. 😍
[knew I’d seen him somewhere before](https://imgur.com/gallery/jN1P6h9) 
Unbelievably cute, I need to win the lottery so I can dedicate my life to rescuing animals.
HE EVEN LOOKS LIKE A WOMBAT

Like for Australia!
Those are human eyes
This dog looks like he’s about to tell you his name is actually Jay
🥺 omg! The cutest!
He looks like puppy & an old man at the same time.. Adorable little fella!
Meet wambo
Very cute and similar to my pup. Heelers need a ton of exercise or they become mischievous!
Looks like a ball of fun!
Beautiful.  Chase lots of balls and eat all the snacks.  
Exactly! How could they pass him up?! But thankfully it's you who got him just in time. One of the most beautiful and unique doggies I've ever seen:) wishing you both the happiest memories together!!!
Lol that’s not a wombat, that’s a dog
Oh my god he is soooo cute!!! I want a pup exactly like him! 
Super cute and wombat is the perfect name. 
I love him.
Those ears 


Unreal 
Adorable
Love the color of his coat Adorable dog OP
It will be easy to clean up with those cubed poops, too.
I have the need to hug him. 
VZ Calais!
Now I want to see a wombat called Dog
Never seen a name fit an animal as much as this one, good on you OP for your naming skills and also adopting this cutie!

It doesn’t seem as though he trusts you yet, but I see a high probability of love, happy memories, and shenanigans once he does.
He looks like a wallaby
Hoping this pup would have a fam. 
https://img.memecdn.com/so-you-are-telling-me_o_1704347.jpg
Because he was meant for you. 
oh, wombat, we love you!
Because he was meant for you
So cute 💗
That dog have human eyes
Womby, all the best bud! 
He's so adorable.  The look that he's giving you is so cute!
Nice to meet you wombat
Should have called him Ozark for the big ears

"Just give me a few hours before I trust you?"  (And yes--I know I should be grateful, but just give me a bit of time?). 
If I ever got this breed i’d call him Dog or Max. Wombat is very fitting.
That's one good-looking dog! Give Wombat all the treats and snugs 
Cause he was waiting for you.
He was waiting for you. 
Uhhh, nah dude I think that's a dog
Poor baby looks confused and scared
[removed]
OMG OMG OMG OMG 
Cuteness overload
WHOS A GOOD BOY?! 
Lived up to it. Awwww
What a gorgeous woofer 
Wombat has no master. Wombat is a free elf.
Get a wombat and name him dog
I hope he never grows into his ears. Hello Wombat!
Yo he looks just like Walter the farting dog 
Phenomenal dog. He may look shy, yet when he becomes more comfortable his spirit will show. I hope you give him the best life possible.

He may be a moment of time in your life, yet despite his current age, you are the rest of his life.
He's a cutie
Awe shes so cute 😍
He was waiting for you silly. 
I read this normally until I saw “Wombat” then I read his name in an Australian accent...
I thought it’s a rabbit. It also looks like the black kid meme 
My parents had a blue jerker called wombat too! 
That is one cool looking MF dog my friend. Hi Wombat!
Donkey.
Had to save this, that face is so adorable 
Because his face looks like Scrappy Doo
That is Bumpy from Enid Blyton's 1950s Noddy books.

https://www.enidblytonsociety.co.uk/author/covers/noddy-and-the-bumpy-dog.jpg
When you named him this did you look up what a actual wombat looks like haha 
'rescued' aka free dog -carl barron
He *was* rescued the second he arrived at the shelter. I assume you mean adopted.
U/Press_Start_Play its a gray kindred
Perfect name! What a cutie! 
How old is it? It already has so much gray hair...
Awww! Wittle Wombat! 
So freakin’ adorable!
One of the cutest puppies I’ve seen. 
Hi Wombat! You are such a cutie!
Wombat needs to be Reddit's dog. Feel free to give us periodic updates. He is awesome!!!
I am in love with Wombat! 😍
omg so cute.
Perfect name is perfect. 
What a sweet, precious puppy. 
He is so adorable
That name is perfect.

I was thinking, "This looks an awful lot like a wombat," so I'm glad OP recognized it, too.

&#x200B;
He was waiting for you... kind friend!!!
Love that skeptical side-eye 💓
What a Cutie!!!
I love wombat
This makes me realize, how rare grey dogs are. 
(Or is it just me?)
Good man looks a beautiful dog 
You the know the Phish TV show starring Abe Vigoda
I think that this puppy is adorable.
OP, please share photos of Wombat standing on his/her own. 
I would die for Wombat.
That dog looks highly confused
Perfect name!
This is probably in my top five favourite Reddit dogs. I love you wombat.
Wombat looks like a real life Disney character 
And here is the next idiot, putting his dog on a car seat instead of a secure box in the trunk.
Lol throwing shade from the back seat 😒

“Why y’all laughing at my ears though”
Looks more like a dog to me...
Umm... that’s a dog.
My god that is the perfect name! So cute
It‘s like they turned Brent Spiner into a dog - amazing!
If you’re still wondering why he wasn’t adopted so quickly go check out the second half of Pet Cemetery. Jk He’s a cute dog!
He looks like a wombat.
That is the most perfect name for this perfect, cartoon-y dog! 
Heelers are the sweetest! So happy for this match!! 💗
Cute dog

Beautiful pupper.
Perfect name for a perfect pup! 😍

Combat wombat
He wasn’t rescued because he was waiting for you. 😊 
Omg shes so CUTE!!!
Those ears <3
Scrappy-doo?
It's so adorable. So adorable.😍
Opossum Dog
Not to be dramatic but I would die for wombat
Dude that's the best name for that bundle of fun!

Congrats!
I think that's a wizard hiding from his enemies.
Quite the opposite, you weren't there to be chosen by him/her yet.
I think that about all rescue pups, and cats.
Man, that fur looks so soft and nice. Give him my best. 
OP, post a follow up pic of him please. 
Does he poop come out in cubes?
He is adorable, it was faith.
So cute!! 
Thats like a cartoon dog facial expression
Congratulations! My wife rescued our 12 year old Pomeranian from a shelter. She couldn't believe this little 5 pound teddy bear was just sitting in this place with all these big pit bulls 
Great name. 
Those ears! Wombat is adorable and I hope you'll be very happy together. 
Oh my gosh!! What a cutie!😍
hello wombat!!
wombie!!! what a sweet fella! Give him all the pets and treats and walks! 

&#x200B;
Perfect name for a perfect boy. 
adorable! he looks like Milo from’The Mask’ after he put the mask on! so buff 
Sometimes they are invisible because they are waiting for the right person to come along. You were that right person.
Congratulations! That is the perfect name. Seriously.  *high five. So cute! Just a precious paw baby. Good luck in your journey together 💘💘
also please let us know if/when he gets an IG account! So cute. 
This guy looks like he could have a Pixar movie about him getting stuck alone in the outback and befriending a kangaroo and koala all while escaping an evil crocodile 
BUNNY DOG!
Because it's got that 'nervous dog' stare.
r/incorgnito
OMG I'm not fooled by mother natures pranks! That thing is going to be an absolute nightmare! Goodbye every pair of shoes or sandals! Good luck on getting dressed in the morning with that devil trying to prevent that at all costs! Want a peaceful evening relaxing on the couch! Haha, good luck with that little guy looking at you with those eyes saying, "take me the fuck outside right now!"

Very adorable though I must say!
The perfect name for him!!
Gahhhhhhhhhh. Look at this baby!!!
Awe he is absolutely adorable so glad to see him get a good home 😇😊!!!.
Perfect name for such a good boy. 
Precious 😭
Shhh i‘m hiding dad. I sneaked out of the shelter. Let’s goooo
Because he was meant for you 🙂❤️
I love him and will protect him forever 
Yep that’s a great name for a pretty pup. 👍🏼
What kind of dog 
My Australian Cattle Dog's name is Wombat! She's 11.
His facex looks like the dog from Jim Carey's, "The Mask"
A sweet little doggo ♡
More pictures and updates on Wombat please!!! 💓💓💓
GREAT name! Best wishes with your new fur child. 
It looks like this boy is mad.
He’s adorable 
He kinda looks like donkey from shrek
Hey that’s my name!!
Probably because they came in looking for a dog, not a wombat
I know I want him!! 
I am not sure if this was asked already. What breed mixture?
He’s pretty 😍😍😍😍
Whats that...  its a wombat
Well that’s a horse of a different color.  
What a creature.
What breed is he?
For some reason I kept being reminded of Batty Koda from FernGully once you said Wombat.
Cute puppy 
Cheers to perfect naming and a new m8. 🍻
Tell him I love him.
Such a perfect name for him! Do you know what mix he is?

&#x200B;
Isn't that u/SovietWomble? 
As the owner of a cat named Bunny, I love the name. 
So cute he has his own song. https://youtu.be/yCrRBHASBz0
I work with a rescue group and this adorable puppers reminds me of [chevy](https://imgur.com/gallery/SQ1PUR2). She grew into her ears, but not sure if they were that big to begin with.
Aaawwwwwwe
He's perfect.
Wombat is the perfect name for that good boi.
Cute dog, and nice vy commodore aswell.
I didn’t even know he was a dog 
Adorable
He's like a cartoon dog.. but real.  I don't know how to explain it any better..
You should find him a little suit of doggy armour so he can cosplay as a combat wombat.
I felt the same way when we rescued our dog. I was thinking we needed to snatch him up quick because they’d be banging down the doors to get him. Turns out he’d been in a shelter for 5 months and fostered for another 6 when we adopted him. He’s the perfect dog!
You'll have to do a bfore/after adoption pic once puppers settles in. 
That's what I said about my ex.  Careful bro.
Super cute pup! Not digging the name though, but hey - to each their own!
That's not a wombat, that's a pupper my guy.
He’s gonna be a real rowdy one I can see behind those eyes.
wow this little fella is really beautiful
I love him 
I thought he had a hoof for a second
😢😢i love him
Is this a blue heeler/garden gnome mix? 
Looks like an aussie cattle dog. Not a lot of people can handle that energy. I've been there
Hello Wombat!
Oh a Blue heeler.  Very smart dogs and very energetic.  My brother has one, you will have lots of fun with this guy and he will have lots of fun with you.
He’s adorable!!!
Please don't tell us where Wombat lives as I would very likely try to dognap him.
Look at his bunny ears :)

Is it Wombats that do square poos? DOES WOMBAT DO SQUARE POOS? I NEED TO KNOW
Agreed. Mine was in 2 shelters over 4 months! 
Poor pup, it looks scared. Thank you for adopting him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-lmVFLeTbM
Omg so freaking adorable. Happy gotcha day Wombat. I bet you’re going to love your furever home. 
I know it's probably water but I'm choosing to believe that you're driving around drinking a gallon of milk.
Awww, he's cute 
He looks like he snuck in your car for the sleeps and when you got in he’s like, “Um... Hey”
Part heeler? You're gonna have your hands full haha. I have a heeler mix and I love her to pieces, but oh man she has enough personality and energy for 5 dogs 😂
He's so cute!!
ZOMG. Those EARS!

Oh my gawd!!!! That thing is too cute
He's a naughty little baby.
Because the right human for him wasn't there yet. 
Your on the left side of the car you think your fooling us we know Australia isn't real
What a cutie! I totally agree...how could anyone pass that sweetheart up?! Glad he's yours!
What a beautiful little guy! 
That look melted my heart. What a cutie. 
She or he 
He's beautiful! 
Wow his head is so big
That is the cutest F'ing dog I've ever seen. 
يرحب كم  بجنة👍🏻👍🏻
Nominated for pet name of the year, and this from a guy who named his cat Farmdog. 
So Cute and Gorgeous 
Gaspode!
He is so cute. Great name. What a great addition to your family 
What kinda breed is he?!
Had to have that.
He looks ornery!
Good job guys 
Adorable <3
doggo says: oh you! u made me blush hooman. thank you for taking care of me
He looks like he has some Corgi in him
Irish wolfhound?
I've never understood people who name their pet after a completely different animal. That's like naming your kid Dog, or Deer.
