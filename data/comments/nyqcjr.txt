When I was 13, I had a cat that woke me up in the middle of the night by grabbing my finger just like this and pulling me into a back corner of our house where she proceeded to have kittens. She wanted me there. She was such a sweet cat. (And yes, she was spayed not long after.)
At the end she got that face like "did you just fucking take your hand back? Rude."
I'm glad your ferret is excited about their *squints eyes* ...pile of gummy worms
This is not the first time reddit is showing us an animal parent somehow "showing" the freshborn to humans. Why is that? Are they so happy that they have the need to share?
‚ÄúKids, this is hand. It feeds us and gives us scratches on our chins sometimes, and in return we live in its house and only bite it *sometimes*‚Äù
Is that a ferret? Man, can you imagine if they‚Äôre the size of horses and you can ride then
THE BEANS!
I need everything I love to be right here, but all I can drag of you is your finger.
Fun fact: they do this when they want to head out to the pub for a few drinks with the boys and need someone to watch over the wee ones
HOW STINKIN CUTE
Hey come here... Look what i made
People get confused, she is not trying to show her her babies, she is literally trying to gather everything that she loves so that she can protect them, it‚Äôs just an instinct
To be fair, the babies kinda look like fingers
That's telling the human "i trust you". Experienced this with cows in our summer place, they were fenced next to our property, and curious they came to us. I scratched their head and talked to them, and then went in to get my daughter, letting her meet them. The next day one of the cows i scratched showed up with her calf, nudging it to get closer to us. She was showing the calf. It was enjoyable. Then an other cow came and all the other cows gave room for it to stand sideways along the fence, it was wierd, but then we noticed an open wound with flies in it on the back of her front leg, and she was looking at us kind of asking "do you see it?". We did an too close up pictures, and sent to the farmer, telling him the cow came showing us this. And he thanked us and called a vet for her. Animals are nice‚ú®
Mama Ferret: Hmm...I want to leave the nest but I need a babysitt--A HUMAN HAND?! Perfect!
Human has been made honorary ferret bebe.
Nice marmot.
So cute!
OMG my heart just MELTED!! Such a strong bond!
It is literally the sweetest thing when animals lead humans to see something important to them. It just shows how similar we really are and that animals are just so incredibly smart and wonderful üòç
Come in come in see what i made
Ha she wants pets but also to watch over her babies. Clever girl.

And now I would pay good money to be gently dragged by a ferret, adorable.
Maybe your finger looks like one of her babies?
Come with me! Look! Are you proud of me?
do they do this often? 

This is not the first video I've seen of a ferret gently grabbing its owner by the finger and dragging them over to see their babies. So cute and so trusting, when you take those teeth into account
‚ÄúAh, nice marmot.‚Äù
NOW TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY
smol noodles
"I made these üòÅ"
"Welp, here they are, I'll be back in a few hours."---- The mom ferret probably..
Animals are the best people.
‚ÄúLook! I made them myself!‚Äù
Omg this is ridiculously cute! There goes the ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt touch the babies of they‚Äôll kill them‚Äù myth... lol
Let me show you the cutest family ever and now feed us all.

I would say the intelligence of the animal knows where it's meals are coming from so this is it's way of telling you it needs more.
Fun fact: They do this to get the babies adjusted to the smell of you, so that they know you're to be trusted and a source for food
Initiating awws...

Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
That‚Äôs a proud momma!
Proud fur noodle
I think she just wants to take a break and is asking the human to watch the babies for her while she relaxes and just sleeps
So much love & trust there
When my jill (name for female ferret) gave birth she half ate the first new born. I obviously had to remove the body from the nest. She literally spent the rest of her life searching for it ;(

I think when ferrets do this they're mistaking your finger for a kit or maybe it's just instinct.

Hobs (name for male ferret) will do similar in mating season. However they try to drag you someplace dark thinking they can mate with you.
Lots of people here giving too much credit to the ferret. She thought that finger was one of the babies. Her brain is all freaked out with instincts about caring for babies. She doesn't give a damn about humans right now. At best, she was trying to get the baby back from the human hand.
he's letting the hooman know it's time for a ferret-apartment upgrade.
The DNA results are in and   
Mr. Human  
\*long pause\*

ARE  
**THE FATHER !**  
\*Audience\_clapping.mp3\*
I don't think she's "showing" her babies. I'm pretty sure she thinks the human IS one of her babies and is trying to return them to the nest. Which honestly is even cuter than showing off her babies.
‚ù§Ô∏è
Deja Vu!







 I have seen this one before.
Take care of my babies too...
Nice marmot
Forbidden gummy bear
The children look like worms
She was actually trying to use your as food for her babies
Come ova here so you can pet me while I look over mah babies
"Here you take care of them."
Even my dog did the same thing it cried to take us near its baby literally cried.
The look on her face when the hand disappears "what did you just do?! üò¶"
u/savevideo
Could it be she wants to let the owner know she requires more food from now on?

Edit: Never mind, others have asked this question.
I always wondered if it was that fingers look like wiggly, furless newborns. Maternal instinct overrides the hand they're connected to.
[Sniff sniff] yep, correct human, come here.
I saw about how unfortunate and unlucky this animal is, this is probably the best thing happening in her life
Was hoping this would be posted again this week /s
Plot twist: He was actually bringing the human to her den for the babies to eat
Ferrets seem like good pets, but how do you practically manage the smell?
the finger looks like its baby and it gets confused
Man I would be terrified by being dragged this way
How does one know that the animal will not bite off the finger in excitement/fear/just like that?
A proud mama
Pls help me feed them
Are those weasel babies or is that someone wiggling their fingers? Honestly looks the same.
Aw, nice marmot
It is always great when they do that . I remember the first time one of the squirrels in my yard brought her baby to meet me.
Absolutely precious
The BeastMaster's crew has grown.
Even animals love to show with pride their children, so cute and heartwarming! <3
Little wiggles!!!
"that finger is going to feed my babies for months"
Very nice üôÇ
its so violently cute aylayket
‚ÄúHooman! Look! I made these!‚Äù

So sweet
Too much cuteness,systems depleting
I can smell this through the phone
My ferret would do this to me. She was fixed and would have phantom pregnancies and treat me like her baby and bring me into the hutch like this. So sweet. I miss her.
the actual OP for this content is @ferretlove21 on tiktok, if anyone‚Äôs wondering. looks like the watermark was cropped out by this user? she has a bunch of ferrets and this one‚Äôs name is brooke!
I think the mom was a lil confused and thought the finger was one of her babies. They look awfully alike lol. I‚Äôd imagine the finger touched the babies once before the video so it smelled like the babies too. So fuckin cute regardless lmao I want one
Vicious hunter drags prey back to her den.
These babies will get their first taste of man flesh.
Never seen newborn ferrets before, and they look like animated gummy worms üò≠
Gummy worms
Hey human look at all these abides you need to help feed, so more food please
My sister showed this one to me on Tik Tok a week ago I think. She wants a ferret now
How proud she is!!
I have a theory. I believe it‚Äôs possible that she thought the finger was one of her babies and she was trying to bring her baby back to the nest.
You know how much she trust you if she shows you her babies
Some animal deeply inheritance the power of cuteness & love & harmony & healing people's mental health & ...
It is so beautiful to see a pet's hooman so loved that they trust you so much.

I have to say this kind of attachments never grows old for me.
ferrets are the best animals. change my mind
Awwww she wanted to show you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Awww little jelly beans

Can‚Äôt you simply share good content? Why do you need to wrap it in silly buzz-words? 

**WHAZAAAAAAAAP?!?!?** 

What? That didn‚Äôt make me sound lit and woke in the fam?

Show me the money! Still nothing? Where‚Äôs the beef?

If you have good content, it‚Äôs good content. It doesn‚Äôt need a stupid meme designed to impress the older boys attached to it as well. Just the content is fine.
Hooman I need you to get rid of these for me.  I can't afford kids in this economy.
People who own a ferret are weirdos. Lesson of the day, don‚Äôt have a ferret as a pet
r/cromch

Edit: I MEAN THE FINGER NOT THE BABIES
Let us not look into how ferrets mate and what happens if a female doesn't do so while in heat.
She was tryimg to feed them woth your hand
Not being funny but, are we sure these small animals aren't partially blind? Those pink finger babies look a lot like pink human fingers.... They're taking you back to your nest
"Look, I only ate 3 of dem!"
I don't know how she trained that thing to be so nice. Back on my grandparents farm we had like 3 of those fuckers run around the huge plot of land and literally rip out the throats of all small animals they could find. Every evening I had to go out with my sister and pick up up to 50 dead animals ranging from sparrows all the way to decapitated, big ass bunnies. I'm never going to be able to find those things cute. In my eyes they're one of the most efficient and brutal killers out there.
I can smell this video
They look like worms lol
Frikken weasels man, I love them so much.
Hey hooman you are dad
[removed]
It‚Äôs a shame ferrets smell so awful because they‚Äôre damn cute
Everyone gangsta until you get rabies

Is this the same ferret as the other one on youtube doing the exact same thing on a shelf?
Where the heck can you breed ferrets?? 

In the US, they‚Äôre all descented and spayed/neutered with 2 little tattooed dots in their ear.
Lil creatures of God <3
Finger looks like baby.
Super adorable! üòç
Oh, that wonderful, perfect trust!

Adorable. Thanks for the share
This seems common with ferrets.
She is just beautiful.
im confused how she did not die from that pain.
Idk how can one hate them , they make my heart melt
What a beautiful bond!
But why do they have to smell like some kinda frito / BO  hot mix!? nice marmet dude.
Is it an otter?
Behold! My treasure.
This is wholesome
So beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è I miss my ferrets every day
So - why is the ferret showing the human her babies? Like, in nature do ferrets force their favorite ferrets to check out their babies? What would bring about this instinct?
What is that animal, its cute
What a weasel.
anyone remember that cow who brought her calf to show her human.

Nice Cat
I love when Animals are proud of their children and show them off. It's cute like "Human! Look what I did! I made a small me!"
why newborn ferrets look like their done loading yet
pretty sure she's trying to elect the human to look after her young while she goes ferreting
nice marmot
Awwwwe
That was so sweet it gently takes him by his finger and pulls him over to see her babies
What is that?
CHOMP
Seeing this makes me miss my fur baby, whom is happily dooking and playing out on Rainbow Bridge. <3 I miss him. 

This little fella is so cute.
I fucking love ferrets so much
I know ferret pups are adorable but those look like worms
Chomp
‚ÄúYou see these I made them! Now love them!‚Äù
So cute!! Literally the cutest but what am I doing here at 3am üòÇ

What a sweetheart.
She‚Äôs a proud mama
I‚Äôm in love. üò´
Awesome
it reminds me of Maurice's sack of penii from bigmouth.
What a pretty mama!
It's such a great feeling when an animal trusts you near their babies. I used to take care of a stray cat who gave birth to 3 pairs of triplets, and she had brought all of them to me.

I took care of them too, but eventually the mommy cat passed away and I had to leave for college so I had to give away the kittens to someone else.
Adorable.  Seems like a lot of animals do this for some reason.
Now what if we reverse the video

The ferret just thinks the finger is a baby, it's an instinct.

This like the third time i‚Äôve seen a ferret do this. What about human hands do ferrets trust so much?
