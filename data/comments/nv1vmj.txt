I don‚Äôt know why I never thought about elephants sleeping on their sides on the ground like that before
Why do kids always wake up so early?
Love how they all sleep close enough to keep physical contact, even if it's just a foot or something. Big cuddle puddle.
This is the herd of elephants that's running all over the place in China right now. 

For some reason they strayed hundreds of miles away from their normal region, and the authorities are trying to lure them away from human populated areas with food drops and careful monitoring from the air
Background story. These are wild elephants in YunNan province in China. They are migrating to the north and passing through a lot of cities. Authorities protect them and having drones watching them to make sure no one get harmed (including the herd). The farmers loss are also compensated. This is beautiful!
Cuddle puddle!
Of course it‚Äôs the little one that wakes up first
The baby elephant climbing all over one of the adult's heads is proof that it's impossible to relax around a toddler, species independent.
I first read this as ‚Äúhard siesta‚Äù and in my head I was like hell yes, siesta HARD mfers.
I like how they triangle trap the baby.
Isn't that the herd which got drunk on fremented fruit?
That is so sweet that the baby sleeps on top of the adults like that. Definitely the safest spot for em.
> Elephant herd siesta

Great now I gotta change my password.
I like that the baby was in a butt triangle lol like try and get em fuckers!
I hate it when I drop my bag of elephants‚Ä¶
Of course the baby is the only one still rolling around trying to wake everyone up.
Omg adorbs!!!  On the sleeping question, suspect large herbivores (horses, cows, elephants) are similar in that adult animals can doze off standing up by locking hind leg & cooking the other, but if they feel safe & conditions permit, they enjoy shortish snoozes laying flat out or propped on their chests.  Had horses 50 yrs, I like to see them flat out as I know they're relaxed & feel safe.  But usually they only lay down abt 1-2hr at a time. They spend more time dozing standing up with 1 hind leg cocked.
Look at that massive cuddle puddle
D'awww, just look at those big ol' butts!
Never saw sleeping elephants.
Background story: 

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57348255.amp

Almost everyone in china is talking about it and there is a team monitoring these elephants 24/7 to ensure they are safe. 

Two of them 'broke into' someone's house and ate two full tanks of rice wine desserts and got drunk. 

one elephant in their group knows how to use tap to get water. 

As this is like first time in history (as far as we know) no one really knows why this small herd decides to leave their home and travelling up to north where less likely they‚Äôd find a good habitat.
They seem so vulnerable.  As if they weren‚Äôt already in peril all the time! 

But they do look adorable in their pile. And the baby!!
Omg my heart
Ok so I'm just completely in love with this üò≠
Anyone else think they were all dead at first
My goodness, I always thought elephants were sleeping standing up, and this wrong answer has been with me for more than 20 years
Look at us

we're the chocolate now
Those curled up trunks tho
The way they group around young ones is amazing! Btw I never saw Elephant sleeping
TIL elephants sleep in kittenpiles.
Oooooooooooh my gosh
This must be a trunkated version of the original.

Favorite animal. They were spooning!
Seeing elephants sleep is more majestic than I could imagine
Beautiful species. 

It makes me sick that humans hunt them for fun... 

I wish I could hunt the people that hunt animals for fun, for fun. That would be fun.
This is just beautiful! I love elephants with a passion. They are the most beautiful animals.
Elephants spoon eachother. I'll file that fact away for later. It will come in handy.
And of course its the toddler that is up flopping around...kicking everyone in the face..saying wake up, wake up...ugh...when all you want is just 15 minutes of uninterrupted sleep!!!
Heaven is an elephant cuddle puddle.
Of course the baby is not napping ü§£
Is there a reddit page dedicated to this particular group of elephants yet???
They're on some good shit
Somebody‚Äôs got to stand point!
Thought they were dead.

They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
Thanks OP this is so sweet! I never really thought about elephants sleeping on the ground like a pile of puppies! I always envisioned them standing while sleeping.
I knew I left my animal crackers somewhere. Sorry guys! Guess they must have come alive or some shit. It‚Äôs always something with me, yesterday I left my keys in my pants pocket and put it in the wash and now this.
Imagine sleeping in the middle. 

Imagine the overwhelming peanuttyness of those farts.
Of course I've heard of elephants, I just saw a pack of 'em sleeping.
The look like they smoke a ton of weed
The way their trunks curl up, so cute!
Daaww the baby snuggled up in the middle!!
Animal crackers
Omg, I didn't see the sub, and I saw them laying down. I didn't see the little one moving at first. And my mind went to the worst. What a relief
When they dream i like to think it's the intoxicated nightmare fuel acid trip from the original Dumbo cartoon lol

Watching this after waking up early for work this morning was tough. I'd rather be there.

Family elephant life
Go back to sleep kiddo
When the baby elephant is trying to get up, I can imagine him saying‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù I‚Äôm too hot! I‚Äôm too hot!‚Äù Lol
So...a couple months ago I randomly decided to look into elephant sleeping habits. I believe this footage to be rare. As most of the time elephants will sleep standing up for a short period of time and go days without. But on occasion they will lay down as into possibly "rest their feet". But this video shows the entire heard having a really good snooze. I wonder how long it was for? But this could change some ideas out there on their sleeping behaviors. I really don't know as I am not a professional, just a guy that had a random thought one night and decided to do some research.
Seems like all the babies slept crammed in the middle. I wonder if that was on purpose to protect them
Not even elephants can sleep in on weekends without their kids waking them up way too early.
I love this. Thank you for sharing.
They‚Äôre touching booties and cuddling üò≠üò≠üò≠
omg this is adorable. I love how they curl up their trunks.
Scientists should make genetically modified mini elephants so we can have them as pets.
This is how we sleep after a full day at a theme park as a family of 6.
Elephant tetris.

The baby elephant isn't much different than a human baby when you're trying to take a nap
Anyone else notice the three elephants play pinned that baby so they could take a nap without the baby running away.
the babiesü•∫
That‚Äôs the biggest cuddle puddle I‚Äôve ever seen.
Odd thing to say but if we humans ever self-destruct I hope elephants survive. They have big brains and trunks that allow them to handle tools. In a few million years they might evolve into an advanced civilization.
Baby elphadoo like, ‚Äúcan I get up now?‚Äù
Pink elephants!
And some people's favourite animal is the dog...
baby elephant feels so secured... all animals deserve this!

they should not be in the zoo, circus, etc - we should just leave them in peace...
How beautiful is that? Thank you for posting this. Just beautiful
Good luck to these beautiful earthlings.
Love how they arrange to lock in the baby to keep it safe
I didn't know little elephant babies made biscuits like my kitty ü§î‚ù§Ô∏è

this just fills my heart up, almost hurts it‚Äôs so beautiful
Fabulous to get to see this. Thanks so much.
sleeping to protect the baby.  omg my heart
Where do a herd of elephants sleep? Wherever they want I guess?
Baby in the middle while all facing outwards for protection. Little brat is like my kids though, just stop fidgeting and go to sleep!
So I see kicking a sleeping parent in the back is common across the animal kingdom.

Looks like my bed once all three dogs, and the toddler, somehow end up in bed with my husband and I.
Of course the baby is awake
wow. I didn't know they sleep like this. Also, it's my first time seeing a brown elephant. Am I seeing the colors correctly? or they're just covered in soil?
Im just imaging a poacher seeing this, thinking they're dead, approaching them, and then they all wake up and trample on him, killing him
Everyone is sound asleep except Baby Elephant. Figures...
Andy‚Äôs coming!
Now that the Kardashians is off, can we just have reality elephants?
Have you guys seen a meme coin #ivorygate (https://ivorygatebsc.com). Basically a safe moon with charity... they donate to various elephant sanctuaries based on number of holders at the time. Thousands of dollars donated so far!

Thought it was a pretty cool idea...
I thought they were dead
That baby trying to wake up his mom about the danger in the sky is everything.

OK but do you guys know the true story that they drink some thing that made them extremely high and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre all sleeping

The first half could have been a scene where everyone except baby died.
This reminds me of that old wooden toy that was different sized and shaped elephants that you stacked up, It was a puzzle of some sort. Or did I imagine that.

Even when they sleep, the babies are in the center surrounded by adults.
Sleeping? 

Na, that's the hour before the hunt. They get food laced with sedatives so when they wake up they won't be as aware, and, most importantly, testosterone is low in the males, so the paying customer can hunt them. Elephants don't sleep like that.

Someone here mentioned it, elephants sleep like horses or cows do.
these are asian elephants.
Now we need an elephant herd fiesta
Why are they so pink
The baby!
Where's the original?

Ah, here: https://youtu.be/8y7-DHW-0TA

That is the most adorable thing ever.
that baby elephant was like *mom! MOM! WAKE UP!, they are watching us!!!*
I had no idea that elephants laid down like that to sleep. I guess I thought that they slept standing up. They looked so peaceful and content sleeping there (except for the baby who was saying, "Hey! Let me outta here!!") Precious!
Leave all animals alone, they have their own purpose in life just like you and I
The best Video I saw Today <3
I think I want to be an elephant in my next life.

Baby is a baby no matter the species they're gonna kick you in the back while you sleep.

Does anybody else think this looks super comfy? I need a nap now.
I envy them. They all look comfortable.

For some reason it makes me happy that young elephants, like young children also pester and jump on their parents whilst sleeping. The world is aligned.
They kinda look like toys
No fire watch?
This is the level of peace i aspire to be at one day
My dumb brain's first thought: "looks like an Elephant Jonestown situation".
I heard that they move x amount of time in order to avoid suffocation
Didn‚Äôt look like the toddler was participating too much in the siesta, imagine that lol

Scared me if it wasn‚Äôt for the baby moving I would have through they were all dead at first
I went to an elephant sanctuary in Thailand and there was a baby elephant about the same size as the one in this video. It looked small and cute and would play like a dog. He would sit on you, but he still weighed 400 lbs hahaha.

Isn‚Äôt this really rare to see? I thought I heard that elephants (along other large mammals) are pretty sleepless.

I‚Äôve also heard that you almost never see when and where an elephants dies. Thus the term ‚Äúelephant graveyard‚Äù
I recently read that newborn elephants now are growing smaller tusks as a matter of survival from poachers. It moved me so that my eyes watered. Beautiful picture and let's tangibly support those fighting the good fight on our behalves.
I hope they complete their journey accross China unhindered and uninjured.

Serious question, do elephants have any natural predators? I assume that lions and hyenas would not want to mess with a 5-ton animal let alone a whole herd of them.
Then when their left side get sore do they need to wake up stand and turn to the right side? Also why the whole family members prefer to sleep on the left side?
Okay, somebody go out and invent Elephant Tetris please.
No matter the species, gotta crawl around on mom.

Fun fact, nearly all of those elephants have no tusks  because of poachers, and no they didn't cut them off elephants are evolving smaller tusks or no tusks to evade poachers

Must be nice being able to relax in the wild because of your sheer size.
What about this is a siesta?
Absolutely fascinating, I had no idea, that is so cool, thanks for sharing.
They‚Äôre so cute! Idk why but seeing their trunk rolled up reminds me of my sleeping cat. I hate how people hunt these beautiful creatures for their tusks.

Mostly elephants sleep standing up in a line holding onto eachothers tails. This is unprecedented behaviour probably due to the lockdown.

These are Indian elephants.
OP the English word for siesta is nap. (I'd have said that in spanish but I'm still learning)
They're all dead, aren't they?
No wonder they are fat
Is it just me or are those elephants kind of fat?
So that‚Äôs how we find so many dead in one spot. They just chillin and flash flood.
