I don’t know why I never thought about elephants sleeping on their sides on the ground like that before
Why do kids always wake up so early?
Love how they all sleep close enough to keep physical contact, even if it's just a foot or something. Big cuddle puddle.
This is the herd of elephants that's running all over the place in China right now. 

For some reason they strayed hundreds of miles away from their normal region, and the authorities are trying to lure them away from human populated areas with food drops and careful monitoring from the air
Background story. These are wild elephants in YunNan province in China. They are migrating to the north and passing through a lot of cities. Authorities protect them and having drones watching them to make sure no one get harmed (including the herd). The farmers loss are also compensated. This is beautiful!
Cuddle puddle!
Of course it’s the little one that wakes up first
The baby elephant climbing all over one of the adult's heads is proof that it's impossible to relax around a toddler, species independent.
I first read this as “hard siesta” and in my head I was like hell yes, siesta HARD mfers.
I like how they triangle trap the baby.
Isn't that the herd which got drunk on fremented fruit?
That is so sweet that the baby sleeps on top of the adults like that. Definitely the safest spot for em.
> Elephant herd siesta

Great now I gotta change my password.
I like that the baby was in a butt triangle lol like try and get em fuckers!
I hate it when I drop my bag of elephants…
Of course the baby is the only one still rolling around trying to wake everyone up.
Omg adorbs!!!  On the sleeping question, suspect large herbivores (horses, cows, elephants) are similar in that adult animals can doze off standing up by locking hind leg & cooking the other, but if they feel safe & conditions permit, they enjoy shortish snoozes laying flat out or propped on their chests.  Had horses 50 yrs, I like to see them flat out as I know they're relaxed & feel safe.  But usually they only lay down abt 1-2hr at a time. They spend more time dozing standing up with 1 hind leg cocked.
Look at that massive cuddle puddle
D'awww, just look at those big ol' butts!
Never saw sleeping elephants.
Background story: 

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57348255.amp

Almost everyone in china is talking about it and there is a team monitoring these elephants 24/7 to ensure they are safe. 

Two of them 'broke into' someone's house and ate two full tanks of rice wine desserts and got drunk. 

one elephant in their group knows how to use tap to get water. 

As this is like first time in history (as far as we know) no one really knows why this small herd decides to leave their home and travelling up to north where less likely they’d find a good habitat.
They seem so vulnerable.  As if they weren’t already in peril all the time! 

But they do look adorable in their pile. And the baby!!
Omg my heart
Ok so I'm just completely in love with this 😭
Anyone else think they were all dead at first
My goodness, I always thought elephants were sleeping standing up, and this wrong answer has been with me for more than 20 years
Look at us

we're the chocolate now
Those curled up trunks tho
The way they group around young ones is amazing! Btw I never saw Elephant sleeping
TIL elephants sleep in kittenpiles.
Oooooooooooh my gosh
This must be a trunkated version of the original.

Favorite animal. They were spooning!
Seeing elephants sleep is more majestic than I could imagine
Beautiful species. 

It makes me sick that humans hunt them for fun... 

I wish I could hunt the people that hunt animals for fun, for fun. That would be fun.
This is just beautiful! I love elephants with a passion. They are the most beautiful animals.
Elephants spoon eachother. I'll file that fact away for later. It will come in handy.
And of course its the toddler that is up flopping around...kicking everyone in the face..saying wake up, wake up...ugh...when all you want is just 15 minutes of uninterrupted sleep!!!
Heaven is an elephant cuddle puddle.
Of course the baby is not napping 🤣
Is there a reddit page dedicated to this particular group of elephants yet???
They're on some good shit
Somebody’s got to stand point!
Thought they were dead.

They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
Thanks OP this is so sweet! I never really thought about elephants sleeping on the ground like a pile of puppies! I always envisioned them standing while sleeping.
I knew I left my animal crackers somewhere. Sorry guys! Guess they must have come alive or some shit. It’s always something with me, yesterday I left my keys in my pants pocket and put it in the wash and now this.
Imagine sleeping in the middle. 

Imagine the overwhelming peanuttyness of those farts.
Of course I've heard of elephants, I just saw a pack of 'em sleeping.
The look like they smoke a ton of weed
The way their trunks curl up, so cute!
Daaww the baby snuggled up in the middle!!
Animal crackers
Omg, I didn't see the sub, and I saw them laying down. I didn't see the little one moving at first. And my mind went to the worst. What a relief
When they dream i like to think it's the intoxicated nightmare fuel acid trip from the original Dumbo cartoon lol

Watching this after waking up early for work this morning was tough. I'd rather be there.
Elephant tetris.

And the kid is awake and crawling all over everyone. Sounds about right
That little “felephant” in the middle is in paradise 🥲
youngest right in the middle, they know what they're doing.
Family elephant life
Go back to sleep kiddo
When the baby elephant is trying to get up, I can imagine him saying…….” I’m too hot! I’m too hot!” Lol
So...a couple months ago I randomly decided to look into elephant sleeping habits. I believe this footage to be rare. As most of the time elephants will sleep standing up for a short period of time and go days without. But on occasion they will lay down as into possibly "rest their feet". But this video shows the entire heard having a really good snooze. I wonder how long it was for? But this could change some ideas out there on their sleeping behaviors. I really don't know as I am not a professional, just a guy that had a random thought one night and decided to do some research.
Seems like all the babies slept crammed in the middle. I wonder if that was on purpose to protect them
Not even elephants can sleep in on weekends without their kids waking them up way too early.
I love this. Thank you for sharing.
They’re touching booties and cuddling 😭😭😭
omg this is adorable. I love how they curl up their trunks.
Scientists should make genetically modified mini elephants so we can have them as pets.
This is how we sleep after a full day at a theme park as a family of 6.
Elephant tetris.
Elephant centipede
The baby elephant isn't much different than a human baby when you're trying to take a nap
Anyone else notice the three elephants play pinned that baby so they could take a nap without the baby running away.
the babies🥺
That’s the biggest cuddle puddle I’ve ever seen.
Odd thing to say but if we humans ever self-destruct I hope elephants survive. They have big brains and trunks that allow them to handle tools. In a few million years they might evolve into an advanced civilization.
Baby elphadoo like, “can I get up now?”
Pink elephants!
And some people's favourite animal is the dog...
baby elephant feels so secured... all animals deserve this!

they should not be in the zoo, circus, etc - we should just leave them in peace...
How beautiful is that? Thank you for posting this. Just beautiful
Good luck to these beautiful earthlings.
Love how they arrange to lock in the baby to keep it safe
I didn't know little elephant babies made biscuits like my kitty 🤔❤️
Where is this??  It's so beautiful that they snuggle!
this just fills my heart up, almost hurts it’s so beautiful
Fabulous to get to see this. Thanks so much.
sleeping to protect the baby.  omg my heart
Where do a herd of elephants sleep? Wherever they want I guess?
Baby in the middle while all facing outwards for protection. Little brat is like my kids though, just stop fidgeting and go to sleep!
So I see kicking a sleeping parent in the back is common across the animal kingdom.
This is darling. Literally made my day! Thank you!
One of the best posts I have ever seen!         
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This made me so emotional, my heart is filled with so much love seeing this. Such pure beings.
I dunno why but i always thought elephants slept standing up 🤦🏻‍♂️
No Sombrero in sight. Alas this is just a nap
The little one that's moving. It's my daughter. 😀
You woke up the baby
I hate poachers
Looks like my bed once all three dogs, and the toddler, somehow end up in bed with my husband and I.
Of course the baby is awake
wow. I didn't know they sleep like this. Also, it's my first time seeing a brown elephant. Am I seeing the colors correctly? or they're just covered in soil?
Im just imaging a poacher seeing this, thinking they're dead, approaching them, and then they all wake up and trample on him, killing him
Everyone is sound asleep except Baby Elephant. Figures...
Andy’s coming!
Now that the Kardashians is off, can we just have reality elephants?
Have you guys seen a meme coin #ivorygate (https://ivorygatebsc.com). Basically a safe moon with charity... they donate to various elephant sanctuaries based on number of holders at the time. Thousands of dollars donated so far!

Thought it was a pretty cool idea...
I thought they were dead
That baby trying to wake up his mom about the danger in the sky is everything.
The baby 🥺
OK but do you guys know the true story that they drink some thing that made them extremely high and that’s why they’re all sleeping
Plot twist they're not all sleeping
Don’t let China find out, or they’re gonna get turned into bullshit decorations.

I've got all their albums.
That looks so f**king comfy
The first half could have been a scene where everyone except baby died.
This reminds me of that old wooden toy that was different sized and shaped elephants that you stacked up, It was a puzzle of some sort. Or did I imagine that.
this planet is truly heaven and we are destroying every single day a lil more.
I love that they are all touching one another. They are so close a family.
I just melted. 😍
Lol
Jesus Christ it looks like the Jonestown massacre helicopter view, but elephants
They have that baby boxed in.

ELEPHANTS SLEEP!??
I want to go and sleep there, comfy. they prolly stink too :S uncomfy
This was just what I needed to see today, thank you.
I thought they slept standing like horses.
I feel like they are snoring
Poor creatures. Who would do that?
Snoozles!
That’s so cuteeee
Most adorable pure thing I have seen today. ❤️
I didn’t know they lay down to sleep. I thought they were like horses
Looked like someone had been playing animal Tetris.
awwwwww i love elephants!@
The family that naps together is strong together.
Today I learned how elephants sleep...
Wow!
I’m surprised they were able to get that drone in there. I thought they were outlawed in countries with elephants to prevent poaching.
That beginning really disturb for a sec Pray I I'm friendly smartstartend
Siesta Fiesta!
Hopefully they didn’t spook them with their little flying heckacopter 🥺
Yknow I don’t think I’ve ever seen an elephant sleep before.
Best animals
i thought they were dead until the last part lmao
Plot twist: they’re dead
Who would’ve guessed elephants spoon each other? Not me!
So cute
Lol I read this as “hard” siesta at first. They’re protecting the babies while they sleep. So cute!
Elephants are just the best animals there are. 0 exceptions.
Aww
Omgg they’re so cuteeeeee I can’t 😍😍😭😭😭
Fuckin kids always messing with the parents while they’re trying to sleep
I love the calf: "Mom...Mom...Mom...Are you awake?"

Hello?
Gigantic cats! I love the baby snuggling in on top of mom. It's cool to see that the baby is more or less in the middle of the adult group for protection - they've circled the wagons!
Soon this picture will be used as clickbait for something like "all the wildlife is dying because of this reason!!!"
of course the baby is up first
Elephant cuddle puddle! 😍😍😍

The most beautiful drone view I’ve seen. They sleep like us and have feet similar to us under their hooves.
So cute. Anyone know how long they sleep?
This is awesome. Elephants sleep laying down?!
This is the best thing I’ve seen all year :’)
They cuddlllllle!
They look dead
This made me so happy. I love elephants
Reminds me of many afterparties
This makes me unreasonably happy.
Awesome 😊 !
Honestly I thought they slept standing up XD
Can you imagine how loud they snore?
They look so happy 😍
So cool. Notice how the big ones surround the little baby.
Hopefully, not a Pachiderm graveyard.

i like how they're all touching. like me and my doggies when we nap
Oh my this is ridiculously cute.  Baby elephants are so dang cute.  Like the little hair on the head and the genuine curiosity they have.  Like goddamn I want one to bring home! 🐘😍😍
My whole family sleeping in the room with AC
Even when they sleep, the babies are in the center surrounded by adults.
Sleeping? 

Na, that's the hour before the hunt. They get food laced with sedatives so when they wake up they won't be as aware, and, most importantly, testosterone is low in the males, so the paying customer can hunt them. Elephants don't sleep like that.

Someone here mentioned it, elephants sleep like horses or cows do.
these are asian elephants.
Now we need an elephant herd fiesta
Why are they so pink
The baby!
Where's the original?

Ah, here: https://youtu.be/8y7-DHW-0TA
I wonder if it the bulls with very large tusks are able to sleep on their side like that
Of course the little one is perpendicular to everything in the world kicking everyone in the face.

Indian elephants - not African.
I love how they are protecting baby
For once I thought they all dead and the baby survived was about to get upset but the next clip made it better!! 

Damn, they been sleeping the whole time...
Also keeping the kid in between while sleeping speaks how mindful they are♥️
Typical toddler refusing to nap
What cute elephants they are ☺️
The kid says hi....
Cutest thing I’ve ever seen
‘They’re the drunk herd!’’ Imagine getting pissed one night and having your entire lineage based on the fact you got fucked up one time and humans judged it.
I wanna join them, looks cozy.
Its been a hard day doing elephant things
Wow, very fabulous❤️
I wish I could sleep on top of one
How could anyone hurt these animals?
That is the most adorable thing ever.
that baby elephant was like *mom! MOM! WAKE UP!, they are watching us!!!*
I had no idea that elephants laid down like that to sleep. I guess I thought that they slept standing up. They looked so peaceful and content sleeping there (except for the baby who was saying, "Hey! Let me outta here!!") Precious!
Leave all animals alone, they have their own purpose in life just like you and I
The best Video I saw Today <3
I think I want to be an elephant in my next life.
I saw this on YouTube just now and squealed! Baby elephant wiggle wiggle

After a long day, there's nothing like a good nap
As always, the little one doesn’t want to sleep
I can only imagine how large herds or dinosaur would have roamed the continents. Must've been quite the sight!

That is the cutest thing I've ever seen 😍
Be a shame if they fell asleep on a baby elephant
Is this the herd that’s escaped in Asia and has been tracking north for hundreds of miles? (Which I saw on Reddit previously) or is this a wild tribe?
Baby elephant: Guys! Someone's watching us!

The rest of the elephants: That's nice honey, now go back to sleep
Aweeee so cute 🥰
Adorable!
Plot twist, they’re all dead
Btw where are those elephants in China at now?
I like how they curl their long snoots
Baby is a baby no matter the species they're gonna kick you in the back while you sleep.
Got a heart attack when I first saw the start of the video without reading the description, thought bunch of elephants was killed or something
It's interesting how the adults group around to form a little nest for the babies.
When the boys get home from a night of boozing
r/illegallysmolpachyderms
Jesus I thought they were dead from poachers and they piled them all up in a hole
The calf nestling under his/her momma is adorable. Mom probably had to work hard to get baby ready for nap time lol love elephants man.
Now imagine it's just a pile of dead elephants and the little one is trapped there.
Does anybody else think this looks super comfy? I need a nap now.
I envy them. They all look comfortable.
Look at that bébé!
I saw this news today: Re-home elephants in China
For some reason it makes me happy that young elephants, like young children also pester and jump on their parents whilst sleeping. The world is aligned.
They kinda look like toys
No fire watch?
This is the level of peace i aspire to be at one day
My dumb brain's first thought: "looks like an Elephant Jonestown situation".
I heard that they move x amount of time in order to avoid suffocation
Didn’t look like the toddler was participating too much in the siesta, imagine that lol
I so love these guys!!! My heart is just so happy to see them laying there like a pack of puppies!
Maybe the cutest thing I've ever seen
I want to snuggle elephants and nap with them!!

The pink elephants are on parade! 

In all seriousness, they’re super cute.
Im assuming this was filmed using a drone. This is a much better use for them.
Scared me if it wasn’t for the baby moving I would have through they were all dead at first
I went to an elephant sanctuary in Thailand and there was a baby elephant about the same size as the one in this video. It looked small and cute and would play like a dog. He would sit on you, but he still weighed 400 lbs hahaha.
What an adorable cuddle puddle! The way the little one snuggles up 😍😍
At first I thought it was a mass grave.
The first time I saw elephants sleeping, it was amazing. I always thought they slept standing up.
I always feel bad seeing baby elephants after watching the nature documentary savage season on youtube. Some adult elephants can be downright evil to baby elephants
Did the older ones pin the baby between them to keep it still and/or protected?

**Españoles de toda la vida**
Is this the origin story of the first scene in the Lion King?
I didn’t see what subreddit this was and almost thought these elephants were poached.
Who loves elephant now? :)
What a cute flock of elephants
Isn’t this really rare to see? I thought I heard that elephants (along other large mammals) are pretty sleepless.

I’ve also heard that you almost never see when and where an elephants dies. Thus the term “elephant graveyard”
I recently read that newborn elephants now are growing smaller tusks as a matter of survival from poachers. It moved me so that my eyes watered. Beautiful picture and let's tangibly support those fighting the good fight on our behalves.
I hope they complete their journey accross China unhindered and uninjured.

I love how they protect their young !

Serious question, do elephants have any natural predators? I assume that lions and hyenas would not want to mess with a 5-ton animal let alone a whole herd of them.
Then when their left side get sore do they need to wake up stand and turn to the right side? Also why the whole family members prefer to sleep on the left side?
Okay, somebody go out and invent Elephant Tetris please.
No matter the species, gotta crawl around on mom.
Elephant Centipede
Let me in on that!
Haha didnt know that they sleep in this positionxD sweet:)
The baby elephant brings back memories of when I was a kid and when the grown ups are sleeping in the afternoon and I'm left there as the energetic one to find ways to have fun and not wake or touch anyone without making any noise.
It's like adorable Tetris!
They’re making me want to have a nap. It’s 11 am. Lol
