That kitty is so round!

The juxtaposition of mama cat freaking out and chubby mctubberson being super chill pleases me.
My heart 
Not overprotective, a good cat mama
My sister and I raised some kittens with their mum when we were kids. The mother cat tried to claw through the door on the day we had to take the kittens to be adopted.

I won't do that again.

Edit: Since everyone asked we kept them for eight weeks and coordinated with a shelter for their adoption. The Mother was a stray in the neighborhood that we took in. She was just obviously really sad about her kittens leaving. We had her spayed and she has a nice comfy life now.

Edit 2: Wait for at least 12 weeks, we let them go too early and that's why our momma kitty freaked out.
"No. No hey what you doin. THat mine I MADE THAT THAT MINE!"
Not over protective at all. Just how it should be! 
Wish I had a mother like that 
OMGOMGOMGOMGOM- you're okay, you're okay mommas got you licklicklick 💕
"Fuck that, I've seen The Lion King. We're not doing any of that Simba shit."
She loves the baby so much its killing me!
The way she grabs her baby is so sweet. Ugh, what a sweet mama cat. 
Imagine aliens doing this to a human mother and child and then aliens online commenting on how cute it is.

"Give me my fucking kitten back you giant shit"
You give her back right this second! 0_0
I think I just grew ovaries.
I do the same thing when someone tries to take my chicken nuggets.
Imagine some giant squid that, thus far, has been nice to you. Maybe a bit overbearing, occasionally waking you up to stroke you, but overall nice.

You have a kid.

The squid picks up the kid and holds it out of reach.

You'd feel a bit nervous.
I feel like this is almost overqualified for the r/likeus subreddit as well.

There's so much love in this little gesture. The kitten wasn't even in danger and mama was freaking out.
“Give it back, human, I made it!”
That “give me my baby right now” is the most relatable feeling ever for mothers. 
[deleted]
Appropriately protective mama cat.
It’s not being overprotective. It’s doing what it’s hardwired to do as a mother. The only reason it isn’t full on trying to kill you is that it likely trusts you won’t hurt its baby.

HUMAN BAD CAT GOOD
Not Without My Daughter 2: Kitty Boogaloo.
Broke my heart a little
As a human mother i can say that my skin crawls when people some people touch my baby. 
give her that baby!!!!!
This video melts my cold dead heart 
Well, there goes about 10 min of my life. 
I could watch this all day. What a sweet kit kat.
She says ‘that’s my baby peasant!!’😂😂
I said it before and I'll say it again about the same post. Mama cat is scared, it's not good to pull the kids from her like that.
That mother was terrified.
I wish this never ended and we could see momma cat and baby together forever!
Not overprotective, that’s her baby!
Mean ass humon
Mean 
\*appropriately protective mama cat, FTFY
"Do not talk to me, or my son ever again!" 😠
Wow. That mama cat looks identical to a rescue kitty I had. He died around 1 yr old of a congenital heart defect. He was so gorgeous, and such a goof. 
Overprotective? Just looks like regular protective.

&#x200B;
I had a cat like that once just wait till the kitten is all grown up the mother will start beating it. 
OP has confused overprotective with normal lovins.
"Overprotective." Yeah, let me just take a human mom's kid. I bet she'll be "overprotective" too.
Does nobody else think this is cruel to make the mother freak out like that?
My child! I need my child! Give me back my child!
Like "no, no, my kitty, give him back human scum"
So sad. 
They probably already took the rest of her litter and she's just trying to hang on to what's left
I understand spending time with kittens to acclimatize them to human company. That might upset the mother cat but it may well be worthwhile. This is just being shitty to the mother cat for internet points. 
I need that little ball if fluff in my life! 💙💙💙
Properly protective mamma kitty...
Nah, she's just protective. Not overprotective. 
That kitten is almost as big as mama
That's a big kitten.
Well, you are going to have to keep that one.
Don’t you EVER hold my baby like that again, Debra!
That is just a really mean thing to do ... 
Wait till the kitten is 5 month old.. The mama will be whooping its ass.
I had an over protective cat mom eat it’s kitty child’s head off....

I’m in the midst of having a mental breakdown and this made me feel a lot better. Hey thanks. 
they were teasing the mama cat. no wonder she was being overprotective of her baby

Ahhhhhhh! I just died from the cuteness and went to heaven!!!

Give her baby back ?? Don’t do that 
I am not sure what is more adorable, that fat small kitten, that I could just eat up, it's so incredibly cute, or his cat mother, who not only is very cute, but … you all see it.

I love animals, I think that I love felines most.
Just a cat mom doing cat mom things!
My cat had kittens and people kept touching them so she took them and hid them! 
"That's mine, I made that!"
NO. GIVE. GIVE. GIVE. thank. 
r/animalsbeingmoms very much so.

Also shame on that person for taking the kitten away from momma cat, looks like it means a ton to her
I recently became a father.   


I 100% understand this cat.
You can tell this kitten has had some ferocious cleaning episodes from Mom before by the way it curls up into a tight ball.
Oh my god give it back to her!
"Bye mother. I must leave." 

"The heck you going anywhere""
Helicopter parenting, just this once.
My brother had a cat when we were in HS, she gave birth and only one kitten made it. She was so protective of that baby. This reminds me of her. 
Hey that’s my mom! I bet that kitten will grow up anxious about everything
I am 42 years old, and understand this affection every time I am leaving mothers house and my wife has to pull me away from mothers grasp. If there are cookies, /i have to make an exception.
The way mama cat held her baby ... got me. 
I've seen a mother cat attack a pitbull to try to save it's kitten. This occurred on a street I was driving down. Apparently that area has a stray animal problem. The kitten died unfortunately. I chased the dogs away and the mother cat ran up to her kitten to see if it was still alive. That process took her like 1 second, then she ran off. I think that was her last kitten.
why would you take a kitten away from its mother?
I've tried kidnapping like this with human babies but the mothers and police don't take it nearly this well.
This is adorable until you think about how many times they stressed this mom cat out before they decided to film it. 
As a new mom to a 3 month old, I get this.
Not overprotective. Just the right amount of protection.
That's just normal protective 
awe...stupid humans. I agree with the momma cat
Give that lady back her baby!! That ain’t cool. 
what kind of jerk does this to a momma cat. leave her alone and give her her dammed baby back. A$$hole human
Nah mate its just bath time. 
Omg so cute!!!
No no no no come no come no noo eeeehhh comeee... here.... Now I gotcha argh argh argh lick lick lick
Lucifer's reaction as Constine rose to heaven 
I felt my heart explode inside my chest from all this cuteness. 
What a good mom!
Could somebody please tell me what kind of cats these are? They are beautiful! 
What kind of cat is this?
Toucha tha baby
That kitten is so f'ing cute
That momma cat is basically my mom when ever I try to do something without being prepared and thats why I love her so much.
Looks almost identical to my cat but mines a male
We had a mama cat that nursed one of her kittens for almost a year.
So lovely

It’s really amazing to see mama animals love their babies. The instinct is so real 
Ita been a few months and it feels like i lost my cat yesterday. He had a heart attack. It was my fault. I should have been a better owner. I should have known he had a heart condition. I should have got him on medication. He should have lived so much longer than he did. Im sorry chum. I miss you so much. It should have been me.
There's gotta be a way to disable the replay on this. I get stuck watching these things for way too long
Omg my heart melted! This mother obviously cares for her baby and it’s so cute! :D
Nah sah way nah 🎵

NO! Mine!
Bad humans!
One time this clumsy friend of mine stepped on a little kitten's tail, causing a mew-cry for a second. 
A couple minutes later, I sat on the floor and picked the poor little kitty up to pet and comfort it.
Overprotective Mama came out of nowhere and sliced me open almost all the way down the left side of my nose. Pretty sure she was going for the eye and I flinched. 

Overprotective Mama does not fuck around.
I mean yea, that's what happens when you take a baby away from its mother.
This is just too fucking precious, I can’t go on like this 
Anyone else notice that the kitten looks bigger in the hand, and looks SO TINY in the arms of its mama?!?! 
Anyone...?
Awww poor mama cat! 
even if i need to do something with a kitten, i begrudge no mama cat her kitten
Tht is very sweet and cute adorable
Ah, a little warmth for my cold, dead heart
"You are above that human, never forget that."
That's the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my life
Fuck this shit for being so sweet! *Tear*
She's gonna cut you, man.
This made me physically say awe. First time that’s happened on here.
I rewatched this like 20 times, how is this so cute 
She knows humans just like to steal her babies for dough. 
Give me back my son!

~~Over~~protective mama cat

This makes me sad. Lots of love and affection something and never had.

Not 'over protective'...just protective enough. 
Stop tormenting your insanely maternal and hormonal cat for Youtube likes and/or Reddit votes. It's literally cruel. That cat sees nothing amusing about what's happening there; it's scared. And while I'm at it: body language. The kitten is scared as well. If this is you, don't do it again. 
Nah, she’s just being a good mama. 💕
Cuteness overload!!!!
That's kinda fucked up and abusive that's a sentient being protecting its young. If it were a person it'd  be the right thing to do a d if that were a bigger cat you'd be pasta strips. 
This is clearly distressing to the mother, so COULD YOU FUCKING NOT
Overprotective? Nah. Protective.

Ah too cute!
My mama cat has a few kittens every year and she just brings them to us because she knows we will take care of them... She mostly doesn't give a fuck about her kittens but at least she lets them eat her milk (sometimes). 
Wow. I never knew a cat would be like that with her baby. 
The cuteness is killing me....
Wow. That mama cat looks identical to a rescue kitty I had. He died around 1 yr old of a congenital heart defect. He was so gorgeous, and such a goof. 
Well that’s the cutest fucking shit I’ve ever seen. 
MY BABAY!!
😍😍😍😍😍
mom cat: Get away! No touch my bebeh! I cut you!
Awesome! 😺
My friends cat  had kittens (they were eyes open by this time) in a secluded room & I walked in which their other cat came walking in too (male cat) The momma cat literally latched onto my leg with all four paws dug into my skin and began plucking them while growling and meowing at me. She didn’t like me or she didn’t want that other cat in there. The only time I’ve ever been attacked by an animal. It was pretty scary and it hurt like a mofo 
Time for mama smooching
Put that cat down or get put down 
oh, so lovely
me with food
That little snuggle  hug before the licks 😍😍😍
Adorable. Not too proud to admit it.
That is the best thing
Man seeing this gif reminded me of simba from the lion king, I just noticed the monkey has a nice grip of baby simba, and also the animals seems to be happy when a little kitty is going to big and eat them. 
my precious!
That is quite the chubby baby 
Are trying to make us cry?!!
*I need to sit down after that...cuteness overload*
This is r/MEOW_IRL with my kids 
Moms are same as human or animals.
This reminds me, I see they are usually so protective but why did my cousin’s cat eat her baby? I’ve never even heard of that before! 
AWWWWWWWWW. Stuff this cute should be against the law.
I wish there was sound so I can hear the little mews
DEY TOOK MAH BABY! DA GUBMINT TOOK MAH BABY!
Ow, my heart. 
My heart just squirted ❤️❤️
Wish some moms cared that much!
That is beyond adorable. 
at first I thought the title said “mdma cat”...
I've been having a rough week and today I found a very sick stray kitty just a little too late to get it help :'(

This is just what I needed to see. Thank you OP <3
Awwwwwww
This is exactly why I’ll never, ever, ever take kittens away from their mama! Just think if humans allowed that. The mom cat is devastated and cries, looks, and weeps for her missing kittens.

Other than the color, she doesn’t  look like her child, I bet she catnapped it

Sounds about right.  My momma cat did similar with strangers. 
I love how cats can angle their paws like wrists to be able to firmly hug anything
*gently bodyslams kitten*
Lol look at all that baby fat 
What breed is that?
Messing with a mom's kittens is a dangerous game.  And the only prize is a trip to the ER.
I'm gonna need more videos of this.
Thats not overprotective. If she be overprotecc, you be deaded.

He is getting big now and I wear him from facing. People will grab his feet. Grrr. 
Its even better than the last time it was reported!
All I can think of is Mel Gibson’s voice yelling “give me back my son”!
Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaants sipennn-------No no no.. No Circle of life for my baby..
I can't help but think the cat momma could have bitten the person for trying to mess with her kitten. Cat bites are nasty D:
Dis mine!
There isn't any love like momma's!
This is mine.  I take care of my baby.  It is mine. Not yours. MIME
The way she just wraps her arms (paws?) around the kitty and hugs her so tightly is so freaking sweet and heart warming. 
Instant tears

Okay 
Awwww :) 
This may seem like a stupid question but what drives a cat to be a good mother? You would think they would be selfish in order to survive longer rather than spend time raising their young.  Is it purely instinctual?

As a man with no desire to have kids it's kind of hard for me to understand these things, I've never had the desire to be a father.
This has to be the sweetest thing i ever done seen 
Такая лапочка)))))
Its mine, give birth to your own! 
Later that night: 2 found dead, no suspect yet. 
This reminds me of one thing: Once the mother cat and her child are separated for a long time, they won't recognize each other any more. Mother cat will be sad for some time and then she may forget. So sad 😔
Best video EVER!!
This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen 
@sellashaw omg

She's not overprotective I'm sure a human mother would have an identical response.

Please quit agitating Mom. How would you like it. For our entertainment. OK OK so I attempted to help a feral to protect her kitties. Well the only one I can see is the runt of the litter. I am staying out of mothering techniques. Beautiful kitties by the way.
Am I the only one who can tell that the mama cat is reaching for the kitten more to play with it than protect it?
Ffs, I have seen this video 3 times already and I do not understand why people think it's cute. If you did this to a human mother, would you think it was funny that she kept grabbing for her baby after you took it without asking? Of course. But because it's a cat it's ok? That's her baby that probably hasn't been weaned yet. Leave them alone. 
Yeah that's overprotective. Have a kid and then have a giant who you trust due to the three seals of size relations come snatch up your 8 month old son and hold it before you and tell me you won't want to break the fourth seal of sizedom to smash the treaties and restart the human-giant wars.
