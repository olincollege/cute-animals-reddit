Daisy is like “Great job on this cake. I’m really proud of you.”
“Look mommy, it’s me!”
I love the pose Daisy is making.
How is your dog and cake more photogenic than I have ever been??? They both look amazing lol
Happy 15th, Daisy! What an awesome cake.
If your dog is a chihuahua, please cross post in the Chihuahua subreddit. They would love this haha
She’s smiling!
The dog looks like she was so touched by the cake and told someone to get the camera so her likeness and gratitude of the moment could be captured for her to look at fondly for years to come.
Omg. This is the cutest picture I have ever seen! Daisy is the prettiest girl ever!!
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve seen today
Pretty sure this was stolen off Twitter. This is not OP’s dog. Daisy is my friends dog. At least give credit where you got it from. Proof with a different pic of Daisy. https://i.imgur.com/lovjE2G.jpg
Happy birthday 🎉 Daisy

![gif](giphy|C3jd2fjUTkJtS)
adore her little smile
Oh my goodness, I would die for Daisy
So cute! Happy Birthday Daisy!
Happy Birthday Daisy! ❤
Looka This - the momma make!

(she says is thing called 'birthday cake')

they tell me  i'm '15' today,

(no clue what all that is they say..)

but Much *attention* here for Me,

so I'm as Happy as can be ^:@)

but Birthdays bring the BIG 'Bow WOW'!

(Can i just open PrEsEnTs now ?)

*edit:* (the humans have the 'Birthdays', too,

n eating cake is what they do

they say this *Special* one, you see -

because is made 

to 'look like Me...' 

but human cakes are flat instead -

no 'decorate'

with human head...)

❤️
Awww what a happy puppy
Happy 15th Birthday Daisy!
You got this dog to stand and pose by the cake
Happy Birthday Daisy!
Happy birthday Daisy

My boyfriend’s childhood Jack Russel is turning 16 in April… I know what I’m getting to celebrate 😂
This picture made my day. thank you.
Lucky doggie, did you make the cake?
Now bow for a slice
Omg Daisy looks like she’s smiling
![gif](giphy|KZG3HjhDZPiMGkh3xm)
So adorable
Happy Birthday Sweetie!
doesn't look a day over 10...soooooo cute
Awe she’s so happy! Literal smile on her face
Your chihuahua is so photogenic :D
3 kids 

3 devices 

1 Pup, probably the happiest of them all
They're the same picture.
Is Daisy's birthday March 2nd or 3rd?
Oh my goodness what a cutie patootie!
How cute!
The smile!!!!!
Best thing I’ve ever seen.
Aww.. baby. I wav you 🥺
This is so precious
The most photogenic pupper I’ve seen in a while
Cherish every moment with Daisy. She’s looks like good dog
Daisy and her quinceañera celebration!! Happy birthday!!!
Edit, one word
My chunky daisy looks just like her!!!

Edit: who is also turning 15 in March!
The resemblance is uncanny
Happy Birthday, Daisy!!! 🎂 Enjoy your very special day!!!

You could also share this in r/OldManDog, one of the best subs in existence!
The dog looks fully content in life.
She deserves to be immortalised as a meme!
A 15 year old chihuahua? You got another 15, tops.
Look at that smileeee
Which one is the real one?
Daisy looks so happy. This picture melts my heart. My pup will turn 16 next month. Hope she can be as happy as Daisy.
Happy birthday,  Daisy!
Best day ever... and the kids missed it because they were glued to a screen lol
It makes me sad when my family gets together, sit on the couch in front of the television, and all go on their own separate screens. Can't even have one common experience anymore - in this case a super cute birthday party for a support cutie pie doggie.
Make her watch you cut it into pieces.
Daisy and this photo really 'take the cake'!
Happy Birthday Daisy!!!!!
She really looks proud of her cake! What a big smile!
Happy 15th Daisy!
Ok who else has to look twice bc they thought there were two pups
I would die for her
Happy birthday ol girl

Awwww!! Too cute!
This might be the best doggo bday pic ever taken.

Seriously.

Ever.

Happy Birthday Daisy!
What a precious gal. She’s lucky to have you!
Daisy deserves to live forever
This is my favorite picture ever.
This is the sweetest thing I've seen all day. Thank you for sharing her smile. 💜
This post should come with a warning. I nearly fainted from cuteness, partly because Daisy looks like a twin to one of my grand dogs, and mostly because of the sheer Daisy cuteness.
I love Daisy ♥️🌼, she is beyond adorable posed with her cake.  xoxo Happy Birthday Daisy Girl 💕
happy 15th beautiful girl
Faith restored..
OMG! Adorable, both the cake and Daisy! Happy Birthday big girl
I’m in tears cause of this photo, thank you for sharing! happy birthday daisy u sweet pupper u
The rats just keep getting bigger

Reminds me of the Weird Al song Trash Day, “but it gives me stuff to talk about with my friends like hey! I think that rat’s gettin’ big!”
LoL the dog actually posed for the pic with smile n all !!
I need a whole field of Daisy’s… or maybe eight!!! So precious!

Edit: I’m NGL I’ve had a very bad depressive slump the last few months so I take all the smiles I can get and seeing this beautiful lady made me grin ear to ear. Thank you for sharing the birthday girl!
Thus made me smile thank you.
Cake doesn't want to buy a dog. 
the family bought a dog. 
cake and dog:
I love how the dog smiles like yeah its my birthday
What is THIS!!! I'm in love with this dog!
I now know multiple dogs with the same birthday as me

Happy birthday Daisy!!
SHE'S SSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE!!!!

Happy quinceañera Daisy! 🌸🎉
Happy birthday, Daisy! 🥺
rarely is a cake cuter than a dog….
How does your dog look like a person smiling for a photo? How??
Reminds me of Elmo rise
Did her tweet get a million likes yet
that dog looks exactly like my dog
We just lost our girl Daisy about a month ago, she was a lil chihuahua mix too. Glad to see her sister from another mister is having a splendid birthday :)
Just so precious
Looking young for 15
When chihuahuas aren't pissed they are really cute dogs
Made my night
>!that is so cute im dying!<
Wow. 15 years. I hope my dog makes that.  She only has half a year to go and so far is mostly healthy (though she’s getting dementia :(. But apparently she is in very good health for her age otherwise but at 14 she finally started showing her age a little as in we are noticing her having more mobility issues and she actually gets tired <- she’s mostly husky, huskies usually don’t tire). 

And at least In That pic, that dog does not look 15. I wouldn’t have been shocked to hear she was 3.
Cake day!
Me when grandpa says I’m handsome
Daisy: “hey, can you take a picture of me and my cake? Stand over there. Make sure to get the full cake and the light hitting me from this side”
to another 15 years!
There is so much love in that dog's eyes. Daisy is a treasure.
I had a white chihuahua named daisy who was taken from me at a young age, this made me so happy. Thanks for this, OP.
DAISY, “YEAH, GONE SNAP MY PIC, I’M LOOKING LIKE NEW MONEY, FRESH AND CLEAN!
It’s all super cute until you have to cut the cake
Its hard to believe that this dog is older than some people in this comment section!
Daisy looks so great at 15! This is why I love small dogs, they get to stay with us longer. :)
pretty birthday girl!💕
Happy birfday daisy!!
Absolutely precious! Happy Birthday, Daisy! ❤️
Omg ❤️
Happy birthday
She looks so proud!
Oh Daisy happy birthday

Happy 15 omfg :’)
NTBDBIWDF Daisy 🌼💛
Was beating my meat and this ugly ah dog came outta no where smh ion even wanna do it no more😒
I liked it thought it was 2 pictures at 1st. I think it has to do with the way the bag behind the cake lines up on the couch in comparison to the gap between the cushions at the top of the couch and the phone, and the distance from which the picture was taken that makes the girl on the right feel as if it's the same girl on the left just zoom in.... 

HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAISY!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So cute. Happy birthday!
And the cake is the morph of dog puppet
Happy 15th Daisy!
I love her smile
That face is everything I needed to brighten my day
Look how proud she is , as she should be.

i love how she's making the same exact expression as on the cake
I can't wait to throw my pup her quincenera.  I didn't realize mariachi bands costs so much so we'll have to settle for a dj dressed in mariachi attire.
I’m crying 😭😭
Awesome. Happy birthday Daisy. Adorable!
amazing
Omg!!!! Happy birthday!!
15? r/oldmandog would like to see this.

Happy birthday Daisy 🎂🎂
❤️
Happy birthday Daisy
She looks really proud of her cake.
She's happy!
Look at that smile.
Aww happy birthday beautiful doggy.
When you finally find out what da dog doin, but it's wholesome
Why do chihuahuas always look old? Come to think of it, where are the chihuahua puppies? Are they all born looking like middle-aged dogs?
My Daisy puppy roni passed a few months after 15 last year. Give her good loves, not trying to be a downer but things happen QUICK and unexpectedly. I wish I had one more cuddle with my puppers. She was a chi chi also. Little shit lol.
Happy Birthday Daisy 🎂 ur cake is beautiful ❤️. You are a cutie 🥰
Omg my heart 😍🥺
You can tell she really knows all the love and attention is for her. Making me tear up
The person behind is holding Daisy up. Probably why her face looks like that too.
That smile. That damned smile
Daisy is literally smiling she loves her birthday ❤️
Daisy is feeling so loved
I can’t tell the dog from the cake—both really cute👍🐶🎂
Aw, happy birthday Daisy ❤
Did someone steal my grandma’s dog? 🤔
That be me
Wow! Daisy looks great for 15! Wonder what's her secret?
This is joy! I hope that cake is something she can eat??
Is she having a quinceanera?!
The kind of wholesome the world needs right now
Happy birthday Daisy!!
Made me smile
Happy birthday to this dog.
Daisy is quite popular! Happy Birthday!
Cute doggo
Amazing. Did she get a slice? 😃
😭❤️
I wish I was a dog cause I'm 20 so I'd already be dead and odds are my life would have been a lot better.
I would do anything for Daisy, she's perfect
That is actually adorable! She's so happy with her cake!
Happy birthday daisy

Yeaaaaaahhhhhh
My name is Daisy. Walking through the park is now a nightmare as every other dog Walker is yelling my name out
Much Birthday!
Someone is very happy!
Yay, Pup!
💜💜
All the kids on devices. Not to sound like a boomer but that's kinda annoying, do they not care about the dog? Super cute pic but it makes me sad
Happy birthday, Daisy!!!
Why is the dog’s head in the cake? And which one is the dog? I think it’s the one on the left.
Happy 15th Birthday Daisy. Hope you enjoyed all the gifts and cake 🥳🎂🎁🎊🎉🤗🥰😘❤️
The thing on the cake looks more like a rat than the dog
Omg!! Happy Birthday!!!
Happy Birthday, Daisy!
Daisy just made my day with that smile! Bestest of birthdays for the goodest of girls.
This is awesome on many levels.
OMG!!! Adorable!! She’s perfect!!!! Ahhhhh so cute.
Happy birthday

What a great smile daisy
That’s a nice lil grandma dog :)
Shedding a tear for Daisy.
She is so precious. I can’t.
🎉💥🎊🍰🎈❤️🎈🍰🎊💥🎉
I really needed this picture today.
I wish I had a damn award, here take this Daisy deserves something: 🥇
This is too much!!!!
what kinda dog is this? I had a jack Russell terrier named daisy when I was a kid
What a beauty!!. So sweet!
Happy bday daisy <3
Too cute
Dat is da daisy birfday dog
Daisey doesn't look a day past four years old.
I don't see her, all I see is the beautiful young dog.
:)
This is a top 10 reddit post of all time
Wait toll you slice the cake head hes going to freak
The dog in the cake look more real than the real dog
Happy birthday doggo !
I'm calling it now this is going to be a meme
God bless and protec Daisy
UwU
Omg! So cute and adorable!
You know when people call small dogs rats… the dog is actually fine for a small dog, but the cake reminds me of a rat.
She is just awesome. LOVE her.
That is soo disgusting!!! Humans, actual people are starving and sleeping on the sidewalk. And this rat looking DOG deserves, what could probably feed a family of 4 a day, a cake with a rat on it?
SHAME on you!
How do you sleep at night, frivolously spending money like this on pets, when humans, with parents and children and dreams and loves.
Love the pic but all the kids are online :(
Is it weird that I think your dog looks like Hasbulla
Happy birthday Daisy! God bless you
Awwwww
Lol I thought there were two dogs
Such a cutie
Looks similar to my sisters chihuahua.

Cute little One!!
I make 15 look good... Daisy
Owner: ok time for the birthday cake photo 
Dog: should i put my arm on the table and smile ?
Is it just me or does it look like a spliced pic duev to the line on the couch and the cake matching almost perfect down the center?
That dog will become a new meme. Kinda reminds me of Harold, but with more happiness and inner joy.
Cute
This is amazing… also, a lot of dogs standing on back legs lately… evolution is a real thing!
What a nice photo. Genuine happiness in your pups eyes.
Me after taking you dog:...Shes mine now, Have a lovley day!
I have never seen a chiwawa smile beforr
Happy Birthday Daisy! She’s so beautiful
🎂🎉🥳🐕
"I'm so proud of my son"
Hehehe how adorable! Her standing there next to her birthday cake, what a cutie pie!
Now video the dog watching y’all cut the head
Good hooman hehe
Awe my dogs name is Daisy too!
Nice hair cut wee man 👍🏼
Fucking love this picture
Wow I love her
I love her! Happy Daisy day! I think Chihuahuas like this are adorable. My great grandparents had the littler, sharper edged Chihuahuas and they were horrible biters. Is this just a fat, happy old girl? Or is there such a thing as big cute Chihuahuas and little yappy bitey ones?
OH I like daisy. a lot.
Oh my god
A fellow Dr. Seuss baby!
A perfect picture. I love her little smile 🥰
❤️❤️❤️
Happy Birthday Daisy, hope you have a great day x
My chihuahua is the black version of your Daisy 🥰 she passed away last November... but seeing Daisy reminds me of my Pepper 🥰
Happy birthday, Daisy.
She looks like she is going to cry in tears of joy!
Happy day, Daisy!!!!
If she isn’t the cutest little thing! Happy birthday Daisy
Happy 15th birthday, Daisy!  You look like you're going to live for another 15 years😍
Happy birthday pup, I hope I have my daisy for 10 more years.
This isn’t OPs dog…
Miss Daisy!! ❤️❤️❤️
Does it count as "15" if she's been taxidermied for 2?
Beautiful old girl
Beautiful Daisy! Happy Birthday! 🎂😀
Do dogs really actually smile? From happy emotions?
Lol omg too cute!! 💕
Awww
Um… that’s pretty fucking cute.
This needs to be a NTF
Looks so polite and well mannered
So polite.
Old dogs are the best
Happy birthday, Daisy!
15! You guys are on a helluva run, wish many more moons for you two 🖤🖤
Love to see dogs smile
Eat the head
Daisy:   O ‿ O
Happy birthday doggo!
Happy birthday !
She’s adorable. Happy birthday to her. She looks  just like my 9 year old mutt. His name is Pokey.
Why did they put a dog in a cake??
Happy birthday sweet girl Daisy! 🥰
That dog looks like it's turned 137 years old.
Happy 15th!
ok pog
Well, Daisy is spectacular
Wondering how can someone cut that cake now. I have a similar issue with cakes that have photos on them.
I have a thirteen and a half year old and I’ve been having a hard time with that. Couldn’t be happier for you!
Man....she LOOKS like a Daisy. Great name.
Get off your phones, it's daisy's 15th dang birthday!!!
cuties
Daisy just chilling on her best day ever 🥳
It's nice to see everyone in the picture living in the moment
She looks good for 15. No grey!
Happy birthday, Daisy!
AWWW :DDD
Not a good birthday treat for an old dog, just sayin...
Time for Quinceanera!
happy doggo
Her quicinera! We did that for a greyhound that made it 15.
Is the mouse head edible for kangaroos?
What breed is your dog? She looks just like mine, but I don’t know what mine is…
I don’t know how to put pics on Reddit or I’d show you.
Puppers
Happy birthday to daisy and only daisy.
The most adorable chihuahua I've ever seen!
That is so freaking adorable
my dog is identical to daisy
I love this!
Jesus, that's gorgeous.
Made my day. Thank you.
she looks great for 15!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAISY!!!!
Look at that smile 😊
I love how she’s smiling! Such a precious doggo.
This just made my day.
Happy birthday 🎂🎊🎉

No way she’s 15
Baker fucking nailed it
Awesome!  Is that a dog edible cake?

Absolutely an Apple family, 2 of them are on iPhones, and one has a MacBook!

I swear that is a mouse cake.
r/ntbdbiwdfta
HOLY FUCJIBG SHBIT THAT IS THE BEST THING EVER
3 cellphones and a laptop being used in this picture
Did anybody else think the cake was a deer at first?

It’s because of the ears getting narrow toward the bottom instead of getting wider. Still cute though!

Lol
When you're a dog, every day is the best day ever.

"I woke up this morning and it was the best sleep I ever had!  
Then I got breakfast and it was the best breakfast I ever had!  
Then we went for a walk and it was the best walk I ever had!  
Then we played fetch and it was the best game I ever had!"
Someone knows they’re loved.
Somebody tell Daisy I love her
Oh my! Look at that sweet face
aww
She's adorable.  She looks like someone who's next to their new car at the dealership.
Daisy is probably thinking “wow you really captured my essence”
She's looks so proud that she raised her humans to respect their elders.
