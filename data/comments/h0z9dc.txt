Of course he is going to be ok the ducky is protecting him <3
TIL dogs can have asthma, Much love and many boops
You are a good boy, ducky is a good boy too...
Wow, I'm surprised he just lays there and does the treatment
Aw what a sweetheart.
First of all, this is a repost fro like, 2-3 years ago. All I could find was a post on the Chive from 2019, and I could count the pixels in that pic, as well. 

Second, pretty sure the dog had kennel cough. Doggy asthma is usually treated with steroids in pill form.
This is not your dog and it doesn't have asthma. You are lying to farm karma.

He better get extra pets and boops
My cat needs an inhaler. He doesn't like using it, but he will lead me to it when he's having difficulty breathing. I'm sure this dog knows it's for the best.

Awww. All the best for doggy
Is that the duck from click
Does he need a C-Pup machine?
Awww Doggie and Duck are quite a team.
He's such a sweetheart. I send him all of the love and scritches.
When I was a kid, I had a very similar ducky (only mine was white, not yellow). Our family dalmatian claimed it as her own. She had a habit of tearing stuffed animals to shreds, and I figured my ducky was done for. But she loved that ducky, and treated it gently and almost with reverence. It was her baby. I remember when it got a rip in the side, she cried to my mom until she sewed it back up. She had that ducky until the day she died. Thanks for the memory.
how did he get asthma?  I have never heard of a dog getting asthma .  🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️
IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE! ಥ_ಥ
This is a thing?! OMG this is both heartbreaking and adorable
My dog has the same duck and he adores it
This is me! Have multiple respiratory problems and know how doggy feels. 

I guess I just need a ducky.

Lovely boy x
CPAP for doggos.
WHO IS CUTTING ONIONS IN HERE
Dukky protek doggo
To him you and ducky are superheroes
That's sad AF
I almost always tear up every time I see a cutie golden like this. Lost both of mine within a year of eachother and life just hasn't been the same.

Ive recently gotten a dog again and am doing better though.
My heart 😭
I have asthma and I understand what he’s going through, just remember that the treatment can make you feel really anxious and jumpy so just be careful with the beautiful boi
Asthma doggy is welcome on /r/specialaww.
#HOLD HIS PAW, KISS HIS HEAD, AND TELL HIM HOW GOODE HE IS
My dog had pneumonia when she was a puppy, the vet said it’s not looking good, me and my twin sister both had acute asthma as babies so we had a nebulizer and hooked her up to it nightly, she lived for 15 more years. The vet has her picture on his wall
Poor doggo, stay strong
[deleted]
Sweet boy feel better
Peace was always an option - that meme duck when he sees the dog
so sad but i am sure he will do just fine
Now I’m sad
Aww, well I hope his ducking keeps him safe!
My heart

I just want to sit next to him
:( rule no. 1
This always makes my day, two animals so so different, yet coming together in a moment like this.

This made my day just a bit better......okay a lot better.
So so precious. Sending positive boops ❤️
May god protect that poor doggo. He is quite the strong doggo.
Poor guy
Duckworth is the best dog toy
Heart wrenching pic
I had pretty bad asthma when I was younger. I feel bad for the dog. At least he has his duck.
Today I learned .... that dogs can have asthma.
Get well soon buddy!
Awww. Hope you bought a bunch of spare duckys OP.
the duck and the dog went to subridit and said do you have any upvotes? I HAVE LOTS
As a grown man, am I allowed to do this? Bc I want to when at the doctors.
I understand he's pain I have to have treatments all the time too.
awww,, get well
Good boi
Omg his little duck!
Guy takes the duck away
you just made my day :D
I know how that dog feels I have asthma and when I was very young I was scared of the nebulizer
Awww
I know that he is gonna be ok with his duck #STAYSAFE
Wow, im curious if he knows that the nebulizer helps him?
Had asthma. Nebulizers are scary. But ducks definitely make it better.
Poor baby hope he is okay
aww
“I wil b fien wif my water chimkin”
Oh god who's chopping onions in here?
Bruh this brings me back because i used to have to do this.

P.S The dog is adorable
[deleted]
Get well soon pupper
Oh man my spirit animal right there.
Ah ma heart
AWWW! Poor doggie! I used to have to nebulize my son. I know it’s not fun. Not painful for them, but hard for the person administering. What a good boy.
Give that pupper his ducker
Give him a hug from me
Thank you (and ducky) for taking such good care of that special boy! I wish him the best and many long years ahead of him :)
Don’t worry I am sure he will get better.
Oh your poor sweet pupper! I don’t think my dog would ever sit still for a nebulizer treatment if she ended up needing them, she already gets freaked out when my nebulizer is running.
that right there is the cutest thing i have ever seen
He will get better
He is the goodest of good boys.
aww😓i hope he gets better❤️
Why am I tearing up
I'm a bit surprised that doggies get asthma.
He's a strong bubba! He's got this!!
Ur dog is a star and u r a great pet owner
doggie be comforting over the duck tho
Our dog also has a ducky he loves but it's ducky III because he's such a hard chewer
Where is my asthma fellows at?
I needed this today
I feel bad for the doggy but when is ducky is there it’s so cute
Ducky is most excellent. Be well and feel great, pupper!
I hope he's ok. You're a great human being for doing all of this.
God bless that beautiful doggy!
Oh pooch baby
Wish him the best !
my heart!!!! omg my whole heart!
Hug him for me, plz.
I love him. I'll call him magnus
I want to give him a hug
Awww the duck will protect him from anything
I hope your dogo gets better as soon as possible
That brakes my heart seeing a man's best friend like that. It reminds me of a dog that I used to have that died of cancer when I was 12 it was a golden retriever. But now I have a new dog and I named it fletch the 2nd because my other dog was named fletch. I know how you feel.
Aww
You are lucky to have each other.  You're a great parent!
He really has a choke hold on that duck
Pure love
because thats what heroes do.
Oh my god... so precious <3
TIL dogs can have asthma and i just cried a little. We need more duckies !
aww poor angel baby 💖🥺 i hope this sweet angel is okay <3 at least this sweetie has his ducky to protecc him 🐥 best wishes 💞💕 stay safe doggo <3
The duck will bring balance to that dogs respiration.... he is the chosen one.
must protec
One of my close friends had the same kind of duck as a childhood toy
I have that exact same ducky!
Dogs get asthma? 😮
Hope your dog will be ok :)
Wow right in the feels. Warn a guy next time.
My newly had a ducky just like that! He never put it down. He didn't even chew it or anything. He would just keep it in his mouth for hours.
Dude this is so precious, I just want to cuddle with him so bad and give him treats😢😢😢😢
Don’t think I’ve ever mashed an upvote button this hard in my life. Might have cracked my screen
Poor guy 😕
Its Sundance from click!
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I didn't know dogs can have asthma :0 

Also cute duck plushie :D
Holy shit, my heart. Quit making me feel things.
I had that same duck toy!
Doggo i love you
Look how good he is he just sits there and breathes it in like a good boy. My grandma gets those treatments. Luckily at the moment I don’t need them but I used to have those treatments as a kid and have an inhaler.
I used to look after a Parsons terrier that had allergies which affected his breathing, when it was really bad he had a little inhaler which went over his snout a bit like this.
I'm not crying.
Baby!!! This made me melt!! Hope he gets all better!! 🖤🖤
Poor thing. His ducky'll take care of him
That ducky is squeezed hard
My lab has that same exact duck and he brings it up to bed with him every single night. Must be something about that duck.
Good doggo
Is it saline solution? I used to use it with my cat, created a nebulizing chamber, poor cat would spaz out the whole time
My dog has that exact ducky it’s her best friend
Oh damn my fucking days, my heart! Goodest boi
Oh no not the doggy oh my goodness Well alrighty was really thoughtful of you sharing your story. Really do appreciate that Bless you heart 😍🤗😍🤗
Omg. My cat Big kitty was an abnormally large cat so didn't really like cat toys because they were too small. He was an absolute unit at 25 lbs but he was healthy and happy. We got him a large duck toy (we called it Ducky) like the one in your post and he loved it. 19 years we had to replace that duck three times. He's since passed away but we still have the duck toy that he played with. "Ducky" became synonymous with big kitty.
My doggy has the same ducky!
I love your dog.
TIL fogscan get asthma.
Ducky’s best friend too.
this does put a smile on my face
This made me cry out loud aaaaaaaaawww
We’ve got the same duck. He goes by Dr. Quacks.
☹
I had a golden whose favorite toy was a very similar stuffed duck, love the pic
❤️❤️❤️
🥺🥺🥺
#Ducky Ducky Ducky Momo, He’s your very best friend!
Awww too precious 💕
Awww  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Stay healthy, good doggo!
I think I had that same kind of stuffed duck when I was a kid. There was no stuffing of any sort within the legs, but the feet were full of those stuffing beads for stuffed animals. Getting hit by those feet ducking *hurt*.
Duck is like the angel 😇 watching over him. Doggy will will over asthma.
My dog has asthma attacks and it’s heartbreaking. I’m so happy that your pup is doing well and has such a caring owner 💖 we are sending healing vibes!
Our two dogs that both passed last year (eye cancer & old age) loved toys but would pull them apart. Yellow lab, and a Golden.   That exact duck toy was the only one they wouldn't destroy.  They had like four of that duck in the house and loved them.

The picture made me sad that pupper needs to go through that but I can tell you love them so much and they have thier duck for comfort!

Best wishes!
My love goes out to this doggy. I hate to see a dog need stuff like this just to stay alive. But I know he will be fine. Man I’m tearing up for this little guy. May he be safe and have a wonderful life.
*all of reddit liked that*
Maybe this isn't the original post but I showed it to my son, who is ten and who has had to have daily nebulizing treatments every day to keep breathing normally, and it made him very happy.
My dog had the same duck too! When he died we built a little coffin, burried him with his 2nd ducky (first one we had "mounted" on a frame) a tennis ball and a treat, he died with his 3rd ducky next to him, in the bathtub. He waited for mom and dad to come back home, we were about to later that day take him to the vet to be put down.
As a fellow asthmatic I really feel for this guy. Hopefully he has lots of water to drink after he's done. Those nebulizers really dry you out.
Sundance and the duck? Anybody?
Alpha and beta pinene naturally occurs in pine trees and can help with airflow to the lungs.  this may help dohg
Man I had asthma in the past and had to get nebulized a few times. Not fun. Go pupper duck will help you through this
I've never wanted to hug a picture more in my life..
My dog has the same duck
😢
Unpopular opinion: people can't get access to this medical treatment, but I guess its imperative that a pupper with wealthy owners can
Poor dog
i hope he gets better soon
Money has been hard to come by
Awww I relate
NEBBY NEBS OF THE NEBULIZER!!! What a lovey kins!
I thought it  was a CPUP machine at first!
Adorable, but I'm also kinda jealous. That dog has better healthcare than I do...
We've been having to give nebs for one of our cats. It's not nearly as peaceful as this
Wow not all Americans can access healthcare services but this dog has a nebulizer...

I hope this isnt permanent. Cause if it is you might aswell end its misery
TIL Dogs can have asthma
Poor doggo 😭
I’ll keep him in my thoughts and prayers.❤️
this makes me feel so much better about all the nebulizers I did when I was a kid.
Such a goodest boy!
Dogs are the best. All the best to your dog 😊
My heart!
i hope he's good now, any updates ?
Imma cry u/UnsteadyEddy
Make sure he gets all the loves!!
Awww poor baby.
that ducky is a top-quality fren
awww such a good boy
Reminds me of Sundance
Hey doggy. I have asthma too!
Sorry
I have asthma to I know what its like hope your we puff ball gets better
INB4 schnoodle
I used to have the exact same duck
Yes! Exactly what I wanted first thing to see when I open reddit. Now I'm about to cry! The poor pupper!!
I'm glad he has a good family. :)
I just realized that if dogs can have asthma, there may be so many stray ones with such conditions and no help.

Now i am sad
Where did you get your setup for the nebulizations? I need to do this for my kitty
I love this. I’ve had so many adult, human patients who know that nebs are necessary but are ridiculously whiny about sitting still and taking the treatment like this lovely soul.
Doggggggieeeeeee
So sweet:)
Hmmm. TIL Dogs can have asthma. Had no idea.
My Bernie is 14 and developed a cough a few months ago. The vet already tried cough tabs, diuretics and antibiotics. He still has issues and I was thinking about a nebulizer. Does it really help?
My pup was diagnosed with COPD (chronic bronchitis). This could be in his future. Was it hard to get your pup used to having the mask strapped to his face? Did it take him long to learn to tolerate it? Has it been helpful? Sorry for all the questions. You guy looks like a real sweetheart. I love Goldens. Good luck to both of you!
I'm not crying. You're crying. I've never awwwed so hard
I have a plush duck just like that!
I love you doggo.
Quack quack
He'll be okay and thanks to the family taking care of him.
That’s beautiful that yall do that. Truly good people. 

I just cannot believe how much that shit probably costs.
My dog has three of those same duckies, they're his favorite.
at what point does the dogs quality of life outweigh your inability to let go?
He’s got this!!
Awwwww the goodest bois the both of you are
[deleted]
My heart ❤️
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen
OMGosh poor thing. Ever had to be on a Nebulizer? It’s awful. My dad had to have one and it vacuums your face so much it’s terrible. :(
This make me sad to think a doggy can have asthma 😭
I'm not crying, you're crying
😭
My dog will have toys like this, then for seemingly no reason decide it is time for that toy to die. 

It’s a bittersweet ending to that toys life
TIL dogs can have asthma
Well everyone made it clear this isnt op's dog. 

But id still like to say that ducky makes me sad, my ex girlfriend's dog had a duck like that. It used to make him super hard and I loved to play with him. 
After we broke up she called me ~3 weeks later to tell me they were having him put down the next day. I drove over the next morning to play with him one last time, he just laid there, not able to really move, with my giving him his ducky and petting him. 
Seeing that duck just makes me really sad, despite our relationship not working out (2.5 years), i really cared about their dog
My heart it cracks(quacks)
Duck is keeping a vigil watch on intruders who can disrupt his master while also comforting him.
Well this is about the saddest thing I've seen all day.
awwwwwwwwwwwww
My beagle has the same Ducky!
I should try this for my cat
Such sweetness.  Bless him and his stuffy!
Stole an image and made up story for internet points? That's sad, dude
I send your dog my blessings. And I’m gonna be quite mad if his ducky lets him down.
Good thing this doggie has a ducky.  Those are super useful.
What a good doggo. I’m gonna miss my guy so much. Love them while you can. This is the last chance I have to let him know he’s gonna be missed.
Duck will always protecc
My dog had the same duck. It was torn to shreds :(
How did he manage not to destroy the duck? My dog shreds all her toys. I wish she had a stuffed animal she loved.
dont give him any dry food and switch to meat  and canned wet food only. it will dramatically improve his asthma.
I never knew dogs could have asthma that is what has always kept me from taking care of dog
How do you know your dog has asthma? Does he (they) wheeze? Get puffed out easily? I’m genuinely curious.....
ohh
I’m fucked up homie you fucked up but if dog got duck then he gon be alright
Losiento
I’m so sad for him.  Does he have someone watching him 24/7??
The feeling when your dogs asthma is treated better than 75% of asthmatics in america lol
The duck is causing the asthma
Even dogs have asthma? Damn, we fucked up those wolfs pretty bad man...
I am just the same as that dog. Except that I am ugly and nobody cares about me. Yep I'm just asthmatic that's all.
It’s actually most likely an inhaled corticosteroid that he’s getting
What an excellent dog!
I low key thought that was real duck for a second
Must be the world sickest dog seen as its been on that ventilator for years  in the exact same spot with the same duck toy...

OMG!  Our dog loves those ducks too.  They're her favorite of all her toys!  Well, except for the ball.  The ball comes before all.
Sweet baby
🥺
I never knew dogs could have asthma.
:)
Aww... best wishes!
Poor dog I wish I could be there with him.
Bless his heart!
To motherofcats04 I'm sending your doggy positive thoughts and energy to help him with his asthma. He's a very cute doggy and he has his little ducky for comfort and support.
Take care doggo <3
Thank you.  I love dogs, probably more than humans.  I see so many people abandon animals because of an illness, and it breaks my heart.

I know it’s not cheap, and you still got him the care he needed.  

Because the alternative, would have been a very miserable life for the poor thing.

Thank you.
It's enough to make a grown man cry
You'll be okay sweetie, duckys got you!! D:
My dog has the same duck. Takes it everywhere he goes and sleeps with it. We named it Pablo.
So sweet.
Aw so cute! That used to be my little doggos favorite toy! That thing was almost as big as her.
It's unnatural for dogs to have asthma. Do you yearly vaccinate? Did you vaccinate too early? What about the dog food? Are you feeding him any foods that are processed?
I needed to see this picture today 😭😭😭
He is so cute keeping him in my prayers.❤️
That looks like a platypus.
dogs have asthma?
Purebreads
Omg poor puppy! My cat Ace was diagnosed with asthma a few years ago, too. Watching him get attacks was so scary and I was so afraid he would die in the midst of one.

I was super lucky that changing his diet to grain-free cat food and changing his litter to pine pellets instead of the normal dusty kind really helped him (especially since I'm super poor and wasn't able to afford the cat inhaler thing). He hasn't had one since! I'm glad we're all keeping our pets safe and healthy. They deserve only the best. :-)

&#x200B;

(P.S. not saying that you should rely on doing that if your pet has asthma. Definitely go to a vet first!!)
I'm a Respiratory Therapist and never knew that puppies had asthma.  I would love to be a Respiratory Therapist for puppies.
Ducc: Dont worry its going to all right
My puppy has this duck too! It’s his comfort toy as well. I love my baby boy and his ducky
What great parents you are to take care of him like that!!
Omg how cute! 

Thx OP for stealing this image and posting it for karma. That’s really wholesome. Also it’s only my 30th time seeing that image, so original.
Awww this is precious I have to use this too so so adorable 😍
I thought thay was a platypus.

*Adds fedora*

PERRY THE PLATYPUS!
Poor baby
Get well soon doggo!
What a sweetie!
Good Bois don't deserve asthma :( please let him know there are lots of strangers on the internet who send all of our love 💚
I reported this for being to cute.
Tell your pup I love him and so does Baloo and Maggie, which are two of my pups. 

Alaska is kind of a bitch and doesn’t care about other animals.
Bless his heart! Sending kisses!
😭 Poor doggo
I can't get coworkers to wear a mask, and this dog does it? I guess I know who's more intelligent.
Hope u feel all better soon sweet boy. I’m glad u have your ducktor to help u
Peace was an option to help a sick doggy...





I hope he is doing good right now :)
Dogs are so pure. I honestly feel like nothing bad should ever happen to them. Naturally or otherwise.
Hey, my boy has a duck too! It's [always with him](https://imgur.com/a/XNtuxJm).
My heart is melting <3 Im almost crying, this is so cute u.u
Duck has the This Is My Life Now face. But seriously, hope your pup gets better.
He is going to be ducky
What kinda cruel world is it that a dog would have asthma. Had asthma as a kid and it sucked balls!
I know the feeling... its so hard to live with asthma. 
Hang in there doggy!
Pretty sure I have the same mask, have to use it every day. Asthma sucks folks.
I USED TO USE THOSE AS A KID. I feel for doggo, those things are so annoying and loud.
What a good duck. And what an adorable pupper.
This might be the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen
My cat has asthma, too. God speed!
Maybe people don't know, whatever floats your goat.
This was me an hour ago, this doggy is my spirit pupper
Can anyone tell me if dogs also take bronchiole dilators  (ex: albuterol) or do they have their own ? Different receptors ?
Seen this before but cute doggo, I think he’s fine now
Our golden has the same ducky and has loved him to bits. Sweet babies and their duckies
Pals forever <3
AH
😍🥰😍
where did you get the nebulizer?
Sending best wishes to the best doggo
I have asthma... But I don’t have a duck
I am FREAKING OUT!
I need a ducky in my life STAT
This isnt even aww material, its r/sad material 3:\[
Quack attack.
Aaaw the poor pupper.  This breaks my heart as I’m sure it does yours.  Have you tried taking them off all chicken products?  It’s a super common allergen.  It stopped my dogs allergic rashes on feet & belly.  Can’t hurt.  God bless you for taking such good care of your fur baby. 🥰🤗
Ugg I had athsma. I would worry about my kids getting it but I married a bull of a woman. I'll be surprised if he even gets a cold. Hope doggy feels better =(
Give him a hug and kiss for me please!
Knows
So sweet.
Oh my god we have that same duck for our pup and he loves it
I wanna hug him so bad. Poor thing.
Thanks, I was wondering that. I’m guessing that’s why I thought it was the gator's birthday and he got pets and was served pie because he is a good boy. And everyone sang happy birthday to him.
The cutest thing I’ll see this week! Hang in there buddy!
Knowing dogs can have asthma made me sad. 😞
We don’t deserve golden retrievers
I'm not crying, *you're* crying
cute
lol
I nominate this for the awww cover.
yo why am I crying
         I
cuddle duck hugs are natures healers!!!
A C-Pup machine if you will.
Such a good boi
God bless him :*
How much does this cost for the month and year?
Awww God bless it
Isn't that the duck from Click?
Oh shit, DUCKY!  My dog loves his version of that toy, it's utterly indestructible.
D'aawwww!  That duck reminds me of another duck I've seen. So very sweet.
My dog just had her uterus operated out as she had a hormonally inflamed uterus. She’s still adjusting, but she is so strong. As is your doggo :)
Poor baby, hurts to watch.
Hope he's gonna be okay!
Poor puppy. Give him a hug for us.
TIL dogs can get Asthma.
I'm honestly just ready to be consumed
awe such a good doggo
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
My German shepherd has the same duck, it's funny how calming it is for so many dogs
This is the saddest thing in the world but happy he is ok
I know I'm an idiot for was saying this because I have no experience with asthma but how long will it take until he will be ok?
I thought it was something else in the original. Something cough. I think kennel cough. 

???
This is the Better ending to Old Yeller, where the dog gets treatment and has a ducky by his side
awww
Everybody liked that
Im not crying 😢 your crying
Platypus.
Poor sweet angel! Please take good care of him he seems so fragile 🥺 I hope he's okay.
Man my dog would never let me hook him up to a nebulizer, thank god he doesn’t need one lol
Schnoodle for medal of freedom, pulling us through rough, dark times. What a gift you are, Schnoodle
Please give him a hug from me!
I relate
Wow I have been noticing that my cats breathing has been a bit different and I jokingly thought "what if she has asthma like her human mom?" 

I'll be making a vet appt asap. I had no idea animals could have asthma.
He’s definitely the Goodest of good boys. ❤️
Thank you for taking care of this angel!!!!
Pls ducc. Protec this good boi
This is a repost
This might be the custest thing I’ve seen in my entire life
Get well soon bud :)
That duck looks like it needs a ventilator as well. All jokes aside this is adorable.
That’s so sad, sorry breeding has done this to your friend.
Good boy
My dog has a platypus instead of a ducky. 
Dogs and their baby’s melt my heart.
Please be ok dude
Ducky or platypus? My boy has a similar one from Dapper dog box and it’s one of his favorite toys.
What does a nebulizer do?
I wish my healthcare was as good as this dogs. But we can't afford it.
This is the cutest/ saddest/ most heartwarming/wholesome picture I have seen in so long
He is fine and more with his friend who accompanies him is his struggle.🦆🐶💚
Feel better sweet pup.
How long did it take to teach him how to take the treatments? I know they make masks for horses but the canine one is new to me. Is it anchored by a strap around the back of the head like the human one? And, do you stay with him while the treatment is going? (I guess sorta like a toddler: you have to stay with them, read to them, keep them occupied- otherwise the mask is off and away they go!)
Poor baby he’s adorable
that looks like the same dog & duck from the movie Click
I have asthma....poor dog.
This was posted 7 months ago and the dog has kennel cough, not asthma. But I guess nobody cares so enjoy your karma
So, as an RRT, how exactly do I become a doggy RT?
This was posted in r/pics in November 2019 by u/littledank 😬
please tell me theres a surgery to make it all better, i will personally make reddit fund it if there is
GET IT TO TOP OF ALL TIME! WE CAN DO IT!
Imagine the dog could speak english and someone breaks into your house and you wake up to GIVE ME MY FUCKING DUCKY!!!!!!!
I didn't even know dogs could get asthma.
I have asthma and I spent my childhood doing this. It sucked. This doggo is such a good boy, the goodest boi.
haha updoots go brrr
🥺
What monster gives asthma to a dog? As a person with it thats messed up man.
We had that same duck for our golden.
Maybe the nebulizer machine sound scares him. Make sure you change the filter every three months and put a pillow over the machine. helps with the sound! and Cute pup!
No mom, I'm not crying... I just got some dust in my eye..
I’d give this Argentium but I too poor /,:
Awnnn my heart
You are a sweet angel for caring for your pup!  That duck is his guardian angel.
Awwww!!!
Brave soul. 💞
We love our duck
Praying his lungs work better and he is healed for his asthma amen
Sooo amazing! Beautiful!
What the duck!
Is that Sundance from click?
It's like mine who every times needs his blanket
Don't be selfish.  
Let him die.  
Cherish the memories!  
Downvote this comment
That's really ducking sweet. And this is probably the only time I'll actually mean to type that word. (I'm looking at you autocorrect)
is he ok?
My neighbor’s dog has had that same exact duck since he was born and still loves it. I don’t know why dogs always love that duck.
I gave my grand dog the same duck....good quacker
I used to have the exact same duck as a child!
GET OFF THAT POOR DUCKS NECK!!!! HE CAN'T BREATHE!!!
No, bad repost bot
Ducks and dogs are my two favorite animals!
Lucky ducky
Didn't they stop doing those because it proved to cause more harm.
/Had bad athsma growing up
This image saddens my heart,  simply because I am a HUGE dog lover.   😥
Bless him !
Poor baby 🐥
Looks like he has better health insurance than I do.
Awww sooooooo cute
Always a good post to find every now and then
It's enough to make a grown man cry, and that's okay.
I'm gonna cry
❤️🤜🤛
It’s duckworth!
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 I’m crying real tears
my golden has (and loves) the same duck
Nice good Doggo
My stuffed Ducky made my old dog feel better. It was buried with him. It is something for him to feel close to us.
My heart :’)
damn i didnt know animals could get athsma too, that sucks. i have athsma and its a fucking pain, simple tasks are hard like jogging is basically impossible.

My dog would never sit still for this.
The ducky has power
Doggy:  I have better healthcare than you.
Duck hunt irl
wrg
I believe this is what we call the goodest boy.
Omg, I have a Ducky just like that, my boyfriend gave it to me after my dog go away of my live and I have some problems of anxiety, and que ducky help me so much,it makes a funny sound. I so happy to know the ducky help others things, this is so beautiful.
Ah,a dog who hae asthma,like me
Yet another way I am simaler to a dog minus the duck
Likely allergic to your scented candles, fabric softner, dryer sheets, fabreeze air freshner, etc.
Oh my heart! ❤️❤️❤️
This is a very lucky puppy. He has wonderful parents who care about his health. And he has a best friend, lucky ducky. What more could he want except perhaps for his asthma to go away.
Such a good boi <3
Frankly animals are the best examples of when human’s insanity has gone too far.
God bless him, and that duck!
I can hear this photo, or at least the nebulizer I had when I was a kid was heckin loud. Longest half hour of my day XD
You people a greatest people beacsue you are helping this Pretty dog...May God Live You Long

My dogs have their own ducky too, strongly recommend buying some.
Awww poor thing
😭
They look like the Duck and the Dog from the movie Click
me before looking at your username: :3. me after: *Wait, thats illegal*
I had that exact same duck when I was younger, I know the feels.
TIL that dogs can have asthma. I'm glad he has his duckie to protect him ❤
Oh poor dog
Dogs with medical conditions make them kinda cute for sone reason
Hi
I'm just amazed he sits still for the treatment.
Fuck off and stop karma farming op, imagine actually stealing a picture of someone elses dog for karma, such a sad thing to do
i wish for you the best of luck i hope that good boi is gonna be safe
Tough to see
Dog will be ok
I have asthma... I want a duck...
That dog has better healthcare than most Americans.
1st world medical health problems.
OP is not the owner and the dog doesn't have Asthma [as someone else said.](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/h0z9dc/doggy_has_asthma_and_requires_multiple/ftpca8x?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Repost? I've seen this before
Thank you for giving that dog a better life.
Lucky pup is being well taken care of.!
was even cuter when we saw this in like 2014
Not sure if this has been addressed. Please get rid of any air wick/glade plug or time release room deodorizers. Eliminate all scented candles. I have seen children with bad asthma get 100% better once all scented deodorizers and candles were removed.
Better treatment than us health system hahaha I wish I had this dogs health plan
Downvoted because it’s a repost.
Awww
Take my upvote. Actually, take all of them. He deserves it
Stay strong dog
His duck awww
...thats a platypus
When cost of maintaining a pet gets really high like this probably is, sorry but that won't be oxygen getting pumped in. Gotta move on.
Spoiled dog

Wow this is old af
Is that machine also necessary if your cat has asthma? I have a 2.5 year old boy and he has asthma as well and has coughing fits. We do have an inhaler we give him in the morning and at night
Awwww poor baby so cute
I had a cat with asthma one time and I have it. They can use the same meds as us
I wonder if this dog is still alive after all the years that've passed between now and when it was originally posted.
Fake and gay
It’s enough to make a grown man cry
جيد
Not really
Yy
Awwww buddy, I had that stupid ailment too. One thing that helped me make it “go away” haven’t used my inhaler all year. 

-low carb to no carbs. Only meat. Yes. Carnivore diet.
😆😆😆
😪
I know humans who can’t afford what your dog is getting
Fake
Put the dog down. He is in Pain and costing a ton of money.
BLACK LIVES MATTER
