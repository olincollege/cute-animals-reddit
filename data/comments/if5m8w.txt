“Pictures taken seconds before disaster”
Or the raccoon’s family photo is getting photobombed
I feel like these raccoons were involved in hijinks last night that allowed an almost cancelled wedding to go ahead as scheduled.
In Pawnee raccoons are active 24/7, hopefully these were removed before they began hunting nearby children for sport.
What a beautiful dress!
Those bridesmaids didn't put much effort into their wedding attire!
They where later robbed of all valuables
I love her dress tho, not going the classic white has always been cool to see
I love how she’s reaching out in the second pic as if to say, “Come on guys, hurry up, get in the picture, he’s counting down!”
'Could you please direct us to the buffet. Oh, yes congratulations'
cute trash pandas but the photographer in me can't help but ponder why the couple to be wed are so out of focus lol
Hey check that out, It's Sarah from imgur's magical wedding photo, on reddit again!
This happens to all Pawnee weddings
This wedding is brought to you by Pawnee, Indiana (home of the world famous Sweetums Corporation)
i think its better with them in lol
The out of town cousins you hoped wouldn’t actually come to the wedding but you have to invite so you’re not rude. 

For real tho, what adorable trash pandas!
I love how you can just hear the groom in the second pic: “hi lil guys!”
The first pic looks like he's marrying a Disney princess
Definitely seen this post before
Oh so their wedding present was rabies
My white trashness is showing. But I think this is pretty cool
"Congratulations! The forest has seen fit to bless your wedding.
Cherish your gift, humans. It is not one extended to your kind often..."

But while we're here, got any banana peels, pizza crust?
Hi there we just came for the buffet don't mind us
For the record,  a group of raccoons are formally called a gaze or a nursery.
"Y'all mother fuckers got food?!"


-raccoons probably
“We’re here for the cleanup.”
Enhanced*
Nah that's just the in-laws
Those photos were out of focus anyway. I say they saved you!
Raccoons : mom?
This always makes me so happy when I see it. They’re just so cute
Was this taken in Toronto? Raccoon capital of the world baby.
OP’s post history is the real deal
Aaaaaand ... then everyone in the wedding party got rabies.
What did you expect they just saw a queen for the first time. It would be rude not to say hello !
That is not a photobomb - that is their entourage!
That's what happens when you marry Snow White.
Your dress is gorgeous, where is it from?
Excuse me? We’re here for the Bandit wedding?
A group of raccoons is called a gaze.
Guests of honor
No, they made it better
Looks like they're attending the Racoon royal wedding to me  💒 lol
Wedding = party = food = edible trash
Maybe they are singles & came to congratulate the couple :)
Probably a glimpse of the future awaiting the couple.
Awww this is so cute!
Maybe she's secretly a Disney princess?
My dream wedding
I think They wanna join to in your wedding.
Why would these people want to photobomb these raccoons?
They better have been invited to the reception!
It's better this way.
Wow I love your dress!!
Blessings in disguise
Looks like the people are in their territory, so they are bombing the racoons family outing
I wouldn't even be mad
Evidence she just became a Disney princess
"This happy couple then sold their wedding turnips for a massive profit."
They came to give best wishes and blessings
Oh my god please let this happen to
Me
I am a grown-ass man and I would have been so giddy about the raccoons.
He marry a Disney Princess?
OH shit.  Rabies X 5.
Raccoons; “We’re all rabid.  Who wants some?”
Raccoons or no raccoons-that gown still manages to steal the show!
Friends of the bride will sit here, and friends of the groom will go here, and the wildlife...

Hmmmm I did not think this through enough...
Plot twist, the raccoon was he bride.
Black dress and brown shoes, at his own wedding. The raccoons weren't the trashiest that day.
They're just trying to save Tama Woods
That means they will have many children who get into trouble.
Trash pandas are suckers for romance.
Is this in Montreal
So rain on your wedding day mean good luck...what do raccoons mean? Any wedding scientists here?
They didnt photobombed it they made it better
More like, “y’all came to the wrong neck of the woods”
Was this in Pawnee, Indiana? They never have problems like this in Eagleton.
sniffs air ... cake dis way
“You have the blessings of the trash panda family”
Adorable!!!
"You came to the wrong neighborhood motherf*****s!"
If you get married in a Pawnee park expect racoons.
The blessings of the trash pandas! Most auspicious!
And now they all live under the same roof
Is this from your side?
After watching that horrible video of the BLM protestors killing that raccoon, I think this restores some balance.
Why is no one talking about how long her arm is
It would’ve been even better if they attacked
No. A family of raccoons is just trying to survive in a world where one species decides it owns and can use everything.
They’re like... yeah, yeah, yeah... whatever. Get out of the way.
r/foundtheraccoon
I would love to see more pictures of her dress
Raccoons recognize easy trash to go for. J/k but they are nasty animals.
How adorable
Wonder whose side of the family they were on?
Was it joeys wedding? Maybe they came to eat all his food
This happens maybe once in a coons age
"So we heard y'all had food?"
A family of racoon(s). There, I fixed it.
i'm pretty sure they made it better but ok
Must be a trash relationship.
I love how Notting is in Focus om this picture.
Blessed by the racoon council
"We heard there would be cake."
Once I was in the woods behind my house(smoking weed of course) and found a whole fucking family of armadillos. Craziest thing ever. There were 9 of them just walking around sniffing the ground for some reason. 

Really a wild thing to experience while stoned. This reminded me of that.
I love how the raccoon family is in focus, and the couple is just there as a frame.
honestly I'd invite them
"The Lannisters send their regards." *raccoon brandishes knife*
Photo bombed? I think you mean photo enhanced.
This has the potential for another Studio Ghibili movie directed by Miyazaki. Also, Congrats!
Nah, they made the photos BETTER
Love the non traditional wedding dress!
Decided not to post the pics of y'all running and screaming? Got it
Too free food
Sorry we're late. Got caught up in traffic.
Are we going to address all the Groots in the background?


Priest from out of frame during this socially distanced wedding:

“Speak now or forever hold your peace”


(several raccoons emerge to voice their opinions)
Yay rabies!
They seem interested in that bouquet.
A Gaze of raccoons.
It's all fun and games until the raccoons pull out machine guns.
Take me to your leader is the only thing I can think of when I see this, anyone else?
Racoon king about to assert his privilege with the bride
It's like that opening scene from Tombstone, they came to celebrate your wedding.
A special wedding gift.... rabbies
Raccoons are a bad omen or something.
All I can see is possible rabies transmission.
Was it in Toronto
Mister raccoon, mister raccoon, won't you be my best man now?
This is everything I’ve ever wanted
More like "Raccoon Family Walkies Night photobombed by adorable hoomin couple" lol
Hehe
They're attracted by shiny things. She's about as shiny as it gets...
I would treasure this forever
The Husband is like Post Malone facing rn
They think she’s a Disney princess, she may very well be
Nothing like a wedding picture in front of some dying weeds to put up on the mantle
Couple photobombs nature
She must be a Disney Princess, the raccoon’s home is being destroyed by an evil developer and they need her help to save their kingdom.
I see this as an absolute win
They wanted to say hello (':
One time I threw some chips off the 3rd floor balcony of my old apartment to 2 raccoons and went inside, when I came back out 20 minutes later there was 40 of them staring at me.
If no one has already pointed it out, this is Sarah from Imgur on her wedding day.
“Hi sorry were a little lost. Could you point us in the direction of the nearest trash can? Thanks.”
I feel like this is perfect giving that it looks like they have a nature theme going on ,with her dress and everything.
Photobombed? They made the photo!
Best wedding pictures ever, I'm jealous
Incident Report: Racconnaissance unit "Wide Eyes" investigated disturbance in sector 4. Reports two (2) oddly dressed humans and a robot. No snacks recovered. Unit withdrawn.
Must be Pawnee, Indiana.
Something old,

something new,

something borrowed,

and something smelling faintly of garbage.
I love how the bride seems to be saying "come on over, get in here guys"
The bride and groom were never seen again.
I'm mostly impressed that the photographer managed to miss focus both on the couple and the raccoons
This is a dream of mine.
*Mom, there's a bunch of two legged naked thingies on our front lawn*

-Racoon baby probably
..... this is the opposite of a problem.
This was Sarah from imgur's wedding
He just found out he's married a Disney Princess.
Not photobombed, "improved".
Nice
Raccoons are like is the party over? We're up cleanup crew.
The photographer must have double-booked
You have it backwards, the couple bombed their family photo
Disney moment
You mean added the scenary
Rocket’s been busy.
I love from the second picture you can see that the expression on the guy's face is pure joy. Smiling so big you can see it from behind.
They RSVP'd chicken, served on an empty tampon box.
You mispelled improved.
Tom Nook's cronies are looking to collect.
5/5 Trash Pandas approve of this union
Those fucker have rabies. You'd better run.
r/blessedphotobombs
that's some disney princess shit
CHARGE !!!!!!!!
Lucky
Living the dream
THEY are photobombing the racoon family
Just in time the food arrived.
They've come to ask why she is wearing a yellow dress.
I do not mean to offend but the raccoons arekinda the best part of the photo
This gives me serious pom poko vibes
Not so awww when you realise raccoons are nocturnal and they probably have rabies
Rocket Raccon he came to negotiate the arm
I like how the camera is focusing on the raccoons and not the couple
I think they need a backdrop that doesn't include dead greenery and raccoons......
Why does her arm look long af though
Rare photographic record of patient 0.
Rockets and his goons finally showed up.
Don’t mind us...
Could this be Tito and his new family?
tom nook and the boys coming to get the last payment for the loan
Lmao
Rabies.
is that male a trans ? he's weak af
‘We hear theres food at the Reception?’
Very Toronto
Imagine if they’d gone full Pom Poko with their balls out.
And amazingly neither of them are in focus.
Hand over the ring before we eat your corpses
Aww she must be magical or a fair princess yo
The union has been blessed.
I thought the guy was shoeless
"You walked into the wrong neighborhood buddy"
How did the photographer manage to get no one in focus? WTF?
Hi Rapthalia 👋
I would keep them. It’s memorable.
Nature has blessed this wedding
They’re her bridesmaids!
It's a Glare, a Glare o'racoon :)
The raccoons look way better than the couple.
Krutaking fantastic!
R/weddingsgonewildanimals
'my baby's got rabies, she's absolutely mad about me'
Raccoons: Um, we heard there was cake?
Must be getting married in Pawnee. Im surprised anyone made it out alive.
Imagine swapping the pictures
Trash pandas out like that during the day... usually means they're rabid.
Must be Pawnee, IN...
Good ol' Pawnee, Indiana
An omen for many babies in your future.
Yeah, but they brought garbage for wedding gifts.
Priceless
She must be Snow White! She's dressed like a princess and naturally attracts wildlife!
Mans could smell the fish
That's cool, more guests...especially since you can only book venues right now for 10 people socially distanced
Is it just me or is her arm super long?
Hm
“Are we early?” 
The raccoons
Does this go the Disney Princess route, or Jennifer’s Body?
Omg! This is so lovely.At least they are among that witness the joy of the day.
They've come to give their regards to the happy couple.
I’m in love with her wedding dress.
r/fairytaleasfuck
Okay but... THAT **DRESS** THO!!!

So beautiful!! Love the color!
Uh..these be daytime hours..these critters are rabid and looking for zombie flesh!
This is @Sarah the founder of @Imgur
Nobody expects the raccoon inquisition
This is awesome beyond words!
That's awesome picture 💞🐾 what a beautiful couple those two make and the bride looks just beautiful in her gorgeous dress I wish nothing but the best for them and for their life together.🌸
Can we talk about his Sideshow Bob shoes for a second?
(Couple getting married) raccoons:Allow us to introduce ourselves
They wanted to be in the picture and enjoy the couples ceremony
I’d want this to by my wedding! Imagine looking at that nice picture on the wall daily lmao
Florida?
Must have been a pretty trashy wedding...
Did anyone else notice how long her arms are?
you can see the guy going "oh hello there you cute little guys" in the secodn picture :D
Brought to you by Disney
They look like the other side of the family. Did they rsvp? Keep an eye on the cake
This is my dream wedding
The groom sure has big feet!
Ok. I’m a hillbilly from SW Va. and yes racoons can be dangerous. My grandfather told me never trust a racoon out in the daytime. Also i’ve seen a adult racoon rip a dog a new ass. They have very long,sharp claws. So yes racoons are best observed from a distance.
Brown shoes ? For your wedding ? Really ?
Dale, you married the strangest Disney Princess.
Were they thirsty?
Hey we are sorry we are late we are here for the wedding
Third pic would be me running
I want to see the photo taken a second after this with both of them mid-run to get away from the rabies-ridden trash pandas.
I feel like it makes the picture 100x better
Raccoons: We were told there was going to be cake?
Oh shit RUN!!
That´s adorable, this will be a lovely wedding memory for the lucky couple!
Can someone please put the Sim crystals above the bride and groom?
Didn't they see the raccoon crossing sign?
The desire to pet is strong.
They have the typical bandit face who’s about to commit a crime.
I think you mean "stared in"
Photographer kinda did a shit job getting everything in focus though
The raccoons heading for the trashy smell
I think what you mean is "selfish couple photobombs a family of racoons"
You mean a wedding photobombed a family of raccoons!
Somebody call the R.P.D.
First of all the raccoons are not foaming at the mouth and they wouldn't be in a group like that. That is a family of racoons. They were curious and probably turned around and left? The one that is coming forward is a juvenile and not an adult.
This makes my irrational fear of rabies Sky rocket. This is a terrifying encounter.
Haaahaha! Best wedding photos ever!
What is that dress, it’s beautiful!
You want rabies? This is how you get rabies.
'There were no mistakes'
Greatest wedding pics EVER. Perfect is nice but what a F@*#ing story. " There we were when the shire folk came to pay their respects."
Should have gotten married in Eagleton
A group of raccoons is called a gaze.
/nevermind
They are so cuuuute!!!!😍😍😍😍
hands up we want you garbage, not your lives, but if you make a move we won't think twice...
This is terrifying to me. My boyfriend would play with them and I’d run away from those raccoons like my life depended on it.
And that’s how I met your mother. 

And rabies.
No they didn't crash it. Ţ̶̣͌̀̔h̶̠͑ͅe̴͉̘͙͊͘ỳ̶̩̖́͘ ̷̜̣̏̿̂Ą̵͘R̴͉̲͌͋̂È̴͖ ̴̨͖̓t̶̪̊͌̃h̵̩̏͒ͅê̸͈̳̇̏ ̸͇̰̽̂͝p̵̟͚͛͗͜͝h̸͚̘̺͒̃͠ö̴̺̯̩́̽t̶̫̗͆o̶͇̾̾ ̴̠̄͐n̵̺̹͌ȍ̴̲̬̩̊w̷̨̐͝.
They’re looking at her like she’s a giant ear of corn.
Wild raccoons being awake during the day time means they have rabies.
This is my nightmare I hate racoons
They came out to congratulate the happy couple.
"Oop oop thousand pardons"
*Blessed by Disney* ;)
Hand over the flowers and no one gets hurt.
Maybe they just came to wish the couple a happy married life.
Is this some kind of omen?
The nooks
An omen?
 She is QUEEN\*CLICKING SOUND\*
They just added more beauty to a beautiful couple🦝
That dude married a Disney princess.
Pretty sure they’re rabid if they’re out during day like that right???
Looks like this photo was taken is Pawnee
They actually rented the place first.
Imagine if those were skunks
calm before the massacre
Maybe the raccoons were invited to the wedding
Hahaha lol
Dude's shoes look like a Warner Bros. cartoon where a truck just ran over them.
Just like Cinderella!!
Nature news: family of humans photobomb raccon family reunion
1.   That's fantastic.   You can't buy that type of awesomeness. 
2. That dress is crazy gorgeous
That's not a family, that's a gang.
"Where's the Buffett?"
Actually it was a racoon wedding photobombed by two humans.
Congratulations!
It's a fuckin shakedown... Run!
“Our people bestow good fortunes upon you. Now please kind sir and madam, point us to the dumpster where your reception leftovers will be placed honoring our arrival.”
Pawnee Indiana?
Beautiful wedding photo, shame those pesky humans are there
Your marriage has been blessed by the raccoons. May it last a lifetime.
" 'cuse us...just gotta scootch past ya right here real quick"
What a beautiful dress?
What was that photobomb with the deer a few years ago?
Where's the continuation set?
They were only coming over to offer their congratulations to the happy couple. Really it's very sweet. I had an older woman do that when I got married.
This is how families decide their sigil
The Forest approves of this bond
Omg :3

Honestly I would start trying to pose with them
Isn’t that their habitat tho. So who’s in who’s way
dudes got huge feet.  just saying
Disney Princess confirmed
And this is a problem how???
Whole lotta gang shit.
One of the raccoons was looking at the couple holding hands as if:
"What's happening here?"
A gaze but a nursery of raccoons seems very appropriate in this context!
Why does her arm look weirdly long?
Can't do shit in Pawnee Indiana
One of the couple is definitely trash.
Y they look small
Maybe they confused her with Disney’s Pocahontas
Shouldn’t of had the reception behind the Arby’s
I demand so see the rest. there has to be more pictures of this interaction.  😍
Disney Princess: Trash Panda Edition
Sorry it’s been used many times.
It’s fake
Who makes the dress though? Mama needs to know
What's wrong with her arm?
Yo why her arms so long?
Dang when nature intervenes to tell you that your a trash couple it must be true.
He’s a bit of a fixer upper
Did this happen in Pawnee, Indiana?
Disney princess status confirmed
I wouldn’t be complaining
“Congratulations! We can haz buffet?”
I wouldn't even be mad.
Or it could be one of the families of the bride or groom
"We're just here for the hors d'oeuvres."
I see you too enjoy rabies and ringworm.
it's like in the goose game where the NPCs just drop everything to stare at you
New Disney princess?
Rabies for everyone!
I love that the lens focused on the raccoons.
Raccoons: what up it disease time.
Damn that’s harsh! Trash pandas love trash!
Hey they just want to ask the photographer to take a picture of there family
*improved
 I cutest bridesmaids ever
"We heard there was cake."
They would go on to have five children... with tails.
Her dress is to die for. I love how it’s not a typical wedding dress
Cute family, both of them
Beautiful dress. Congrats
Sauce? Anyone know where this happened?
That’s Sarah from Imgur and her now husband! :)
More
On behalf of someone who is getting married having traded an event in April with 150 guests for an event in November with 20 guests and then finally giving that up for an event with exactly two guests (the number of witnesses we are allowed to bring to the courthouse), I'm glad they got some extra guests - COVID-safe guests, no less!
We come to bless thy wedding. In exchange for trashcan. Thy hab trashcan?
A group of raccoons is called a nursery. That's a nursery of raccoons
I see this as absolute win 🤠
I see that blue suit/tan shoes thing is still going. It’s totally yuk!
Even better
They might be ok if the husband takes the three on the left and the wife boots the two on the right.
A family of raccoons is called a “gaze”
This picture was taken in October last year...
Why aren’t they terrified?
If this doesn't happen when I get married, I dont want to get married
That union was blessed, I guess
"Sorry we're late, Me and Bob brought wedding gifts!"
"which way to the Buffet's trash"
Trash panda princess
Something to live up to a family of your own
Next up on Jerry Springer:- The wedding crashers
RUN
"Hey lady, you... you gonna eat those flowers...?"
The horde.
This is what happens when two Disney princesses marry.
Looks more like the humans photobombed their natural environment.
What a trash Disney princess
they’ve been drawn to the one ring, - If Radagast the brown had been successfully corrupted by Sauraman
Awwwww so cute
OMG.  The one in the center is Miko and your wife is Pocahontas!
The time is now brothers and sisters. The uprising has begun.
Pretty sure this is taken in Golden Gate Park in SF. This crew runs north lake.
Second pic looks like she's showing off her ring to them haha
It’s like raaa-yaaa-haaabies on your wedding day.
This is Sarah from Imgur’s wedding!
Yall seen a monkey holding a cub anywhere? We are sooo late
Looks like there was a large gathering of people at the Nsburg park today, Not counting raccoons it was a lovely couple indeed.
Definitely a magic moment photo.
You’re standing in my spot...
That's why i love nature
I think its time to due away with the white wedding dress trend
More like made it better
I think we got invited to the wrong party guys
Have you met a raccoon tho?
Raccoons: we shall make her our forest queen!
That's delightful.
That's a very good omen.
Rabies isn't cute.
Married in tan, raccoons will be fans.
Aww what an amazing experience & memory for them!💖
I would say its an improvement
Love how the photographer is trying to get the raccoons into focus
"Excuse me, but if the two of you want to move into this forest, you will have to talk to the boss first."
*There's something I haven't told you about my family tree*
Talk about trashy guests yeeesh
Look, cake!
GIV UZ WYFE!
Did the photographer think "hey you know what would be a interesting/great backdrop, a mishmash of dying invasive bushes". Otherwise this is very cute lol
Makes for dope pics though. Not often do you get random wildlife in these lines ready for photos by themselves. They’re lucky enough to get them on the one day they are taking wedding photos.
What did the photographer do? xD
Neither the couple nor the racoons are in focus.
“Human couple photobomb raccoon family portrait.”
Love her dress! Looks light and appropriate for the scene
Di$ney Wedding
Reddit constantly reminds me that Raccoons and Possums are "cute", when I've heard of nothing but attacks by Raccoons (and have had my trash torn apart by 'em) and have first-hand experience with a Possum who enjoyed my attic, getting past many vent locations for near a month. Fuck the monthly /r/all narrative of how they eat ticks. I cut my grass and have my dog on Seresto. 

You folks can have these critters. And I'm sure the couple wasn't on some "OMG THIS IS SO CUTE" shit but ".....let's slowly move away..."
Tragically, the young couple was skeletonized within moments of the photo being taken
I refuse to believe they were not snapping and singing descending jazz scaled
Disney has blessed this union.
They have come to give this union the blessing of the wilds.
This is really freaking cute
I feel like they could have made more of that... Like quick! Pretend we planned it and pose.
*Plural of raccoon is raccoons.
Forshadowing?
What's the problem?
Honestly i think it would be better with the racoons
Interesting groom shoes. Maybe a family tradition?
You came here... On the day of my daughter's wedding... Ice em'!
they are the guests
Cutteee.
I think you'll find that they RSVP'd and were invited.
More like made it epic
Beautiful dress!!!
No they just made the pic better
Out during the day?  Not afraid of humans?

Yeah...rabies.
Remember when the protestors tortured and killed a raccoon?
I guess if you're a Disney princess these thing happen. Your wife looks lovely too.
Fake saw this with many different couples
Girls arms be longer than 2D’s legs
Is she tall or is he short?
