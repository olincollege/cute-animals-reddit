The cat just goes limp upon satisfaction.

TIL Maru has a Chinese cousin with a coke problem. 
Slide in her dm like.
Is this a coca cola box in a different language?

That's note a Poké Ball, it's a Coké Box!

Sent to like 10 of my cat boys already 
If it fits, it sits
This was my cat Bill's favorite thing to do before he got too fat to fit inside the empty 12 pack box.  Towards the end there he would just shove his face into one end of it and scoot around in circles.

He was sitting in the corner waiting for that box to drop.

haha he looks like a shrimp at the end

Talk about a universal brand. You just know it's Coke and you don't need to know anything else about that character set.
I'm partially excited about Christmas because there will be tons of boxes and we always do Christmas at my sister's house.  One of her cats does this to. 
Brand identity is having a recognizable logo even in a different language. 
What Coca Cola language is this, or is it something else?
r/animalsbeingderps ?

Cat dunk. 
Awesome lol. My cat does this but he slides across the floor with his front paws in my slipper.
One day, science will make an artificial intelligence machine to allow the communication between humans and cats. We will then, finally, know why this obsession of them with boxes.
Years of internet has made me paranoid of seeing Asian text and the word “Trap” in the same sentence.
Cat.

Hesitant to upvote this because it having so many replies but no upvotes makes me think it’s a repost
Can’t fight the force of the cat magnet. Can’t...fight it....SLIDE!

I think this cat has a coke problem. 
what are cats doing when they get in boxes? is it just for fun?
My cat is broken it hates boxes
Will this work on wild tigers, too?
Fake

The box is full of cat magnets
Our kitty used to do that with paper bags, until one day his tail got caught in the handle and he could not out run the evil crinkle noise that was chasing him.

He has never recovered from that incident.

Is that a Pokemon I see??

Good catch! 
Like a me.
Is there any explanation for the cats reaction? 
Is that a Savannah cat?
When you expect some edgy joke about coke corporation but it all works out for the better.
I love this cat’s Garfield-esque coloring! 
The trap IS the bait.
I ain't afraid of no puss.
I think she found her new home 
That cat has quick reaction times. As soon as it landed, the cat pounced.
I choose you 
saaaaaaafe

This is the funniest thing I have seen today

Is that Asian Coca-Cola? The font looks similar
My cat is the same with boxes. Put a box in front of her and she will go right in
Lovin’ it!
Would 10/10 rub the belly of that temporarily incapacitated kitty
Interesting...
Nice💕💕💕😍

A Chinese cat trap?  They’ve upgraded from the finger traps of my childhood.
Dope and cute!
Heh, just did this today with a BIG box of Oreos (the kind you get from Sam's Club). Not 5 seconds after I put it on the floor, *POOF!* there was the kitten!
I d bet the cat had him take this video
Humane as well did you see how it instantly and painlessly killed the cat? /s
Kinda looks like Pennsylvania 
its reversed smh
Screw you Maru I can do it too! - Cat probably
My cat is like that but with retried beans. She goes totally 1 track minded. I have walked into a room to witness her back legs sticking out of a trash bin that contained a used can. 
r/slygifs
LOL, I wish mouse traps worked that fast
LMAO How much Fish did you Paid to that Cat for doing this video.
Now I see why the plastic rings are a problem for sea creatures
Can anyone tell me why cats like doing this? My bro's kitten does it all the time with those big water bottle packages
r/scriptedasiangifs
I need to try this, my cat does goofy stuff like this cutie
The cat loves coke
Our cat loves those long 12 pack boxes. I tear off one end and the hand hole tab, put toys inside and flatten the open end by pressing opposing corners together, then just put it on the floor. She'll spend hours at a time just swatting a bell ball and stuffed mouse toy through the hand hole. Sometimes she can get the flattened end opened up, at which point she dives head first into the box because apparently that's as fun as a rollercoaster.
This is why sea trash is so devastating, shit is like a magnet. 
Some say he’s still lay there
Great for vet visits.
Funny cat.

I am pretty sure I have seen this on ghostbusters

Sooo cute!
Looks like the cat trap is working 
Ah fuck Karen, we talked about this!
This is cute that I saved it the last time it was posted.
Not the same except for how instantaneous it was, but this reminds me of my kitten. He will eat anything, and we have to hide bread in the cupboards so he won't seek and destroy an entire loaf. 

Anyway, the other day, I came home with groceries and was showing my husband something I bought for dinner. I took the loaf of bread out and put it down next to the bag as I looked for the item. Suddenly, our kitten came out of NOWHERE and glomped onto the loaf, biting into the plastic. 

We lost a few slices of bread and learned an important lesson that day 😅

Hmm, let me be educated on how people believe this harmless gif is animal cruelty. 
What is with felines and boxes ? Even an experimental box was put in the wild the lions and tigers entered crushed or sat on or in depending on the box. The link was even big cats like boxes. I think

Not the trap I was hoping for but ok
Not the sort of trap I was expecting. 
Is there one for the other kind of trap pls?
 One of Niijima's very few techniques that involves fighting back. Niijima creates and sets up a very elaborate trap by using scrap parts and rubble from all around an area. This was apparently effective enough to keep the leader of the Capoeria Team distracted and on his toes during the D of D tournament.

It looks like it says "Loot". That cat must play MMOs
