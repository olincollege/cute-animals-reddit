samoyed are so extra, i need to get one
My Samoyed would do that too when I would take a bath. He would eat all the bubbles. He even jumped in one night, I had to get my husband to come get him out. He’s a water dog 100%
He wants to join in
This has been posted so many times I recognized the bathtub in the first second. 

And I don't even mind...
Just keeping you company in case you get bored.
MoonMoon just chillin’
I love Samoyeds.

#THEY'RE SO FLUFFY
In case you drown
WAT DOING
Best lifeguard ever
Cute af. Mom fine?
yeah sure. if he does it it's cute, but if i do it they start screaming and call the police again...
[deleted]
Did anyone else notice how brown the water was?
Reminds me of Ghost the Samoyed on IG. Hope he’s doing alright. His owners haven’t posted in months.
I would love that
Ends too soon.. Need more fluffy boy!
“You mean you LIKE baths?!”
My moms neighbors have two. And every once in a while they’ll get out. They prance around the neighborhood together looking for cuddles. They are the sweetest things ever.
My daughter does the same thing... only while saying: “Mom ... Mom .... Mom ... Mom ...”
I need to make sure you’re safe.
that gave me a belly laugh. Thank you
My heart just been stolen, stop thief!

"Is walk time, not bath time..."
"Are you done yet? Are you done yet?"
"Whatchya doing?"
I knew there was going to be a dog there and it was going to be cute, but I didn't have any idea it would be ***THAT*** cute.
Prob smells like, use your imagination
"So um, I can drink *this* water right?"
Oh someone loooooves you <3
AWWWWWW LOL
"What are you doing?" 👀
Are you okay? Just making sure you're okay. Don't drown. Here, I'll stay here so you don't drown. Are you coming out yet? I don't want you to drown
"It appears you know how stressful baths are? I don't understand"
Whys the water so brown
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s beautiful. I’ve looked at this for 5 hours now
Nice marmot
So cute! LOL! I had a cat that would stand on my stomach while I was in the bath.
Hello. I am a floofer and I will be your lifeguard tonight...

Hello
Are there any bots that can check videos to see if they're reposts?
"Hola human..  mind if i join :3"
r/boopthesnoot
The cutest!!
This is how my mom has been for the past few months. She yells “I’m bored” constantly. She doesn’t seem to like any of my suggestions of what to do though...
*whispers* “hey....how ya doing”
That is quite relaxing.  I love when my pupper comes in and sits with me while I'm taking a soak.
Didn’t think I’d see you with a high karma post on my main account 😍
[deleted]
Is 3 years the max lifespan for a redditor? I feel like I've seen all of the repost that make the front page and should move on to some other site
I don't see a problem here. 🤷🏼‍♀️
This is hysterical!!!!
Ever since I brought home my sweet bulldog 2.5 years ago, I haven’t been able to go to the bathroom by myself. She also tries to hop in the shower with me an chance she gets.
Much floof.
He’s such a good boy 😍
Kinda some murky ass water there, eh?
When the food gets dropped off but they forget your side of ranch
🤣🤣🤣🤣 The way this doggo had its head tilted had me.
He knows the camera should be horizontal
"Why is one of them lopsided?"
Bless her heart
If you want to keep your dog’s tear tracks clean like his, give them 1/4 to 1 tsp (dependent on weight) of coconut oil orally daily and wipe their eye tracks with sensitive baby wipes in the morning. We have seen big improvements in my Frenchie’s eye cleanliness.
Is that water or tea? What the hell is going on here, Amanda?
Best companion ever!
Love it.  Mine will bring his stuffed animals one by one and put them in the tub with me, which is not always a welcome addition.

In other words:  YUCK!
he's clowning on you for vertical recording
 What s/he said.
Sammys just always seem to look happy.
What species of dog is this? Asking for a friend :)
hahah what a lovable duffus!
“Hello there”
It’s interesting how the tub is boxed in and tiled over on the side not against the wall.
That is why you have a small bowl of treats next to the bath.  Or maybe that's why he was there because I had a bowl of treats...  Hmm..
That would be relaxing.  Happy pup.
Those are some black legs
“What are those?”
Adorbs 💕
Hehe floof
Lmfaooo
Awwww, what kind of dog breed is that? so cute:)
Can I get in yet?
Love!! What a funny, sweet, pup!
Pretty sure i would pay tot have my (or any) dog do this to me.
Can't wait for a few months to pass to see this reposted again
Awwwwe, Sammies! They’re all love and play.
There's my brother snow doge
Me when I want something 😂
I- the water color sksk-
He’s like “blink once if you’re being forced against your will”
I see no downside here

Never.... you're in the bathroom, they're in the bathroom... it's the law!!
Lmaoooo was not expecting that, bravo <3
That dog looks like a teddy bear! It's so cute!
Mine loves to come in when I'm on the toilet and just stare. I wonder if he learned it from me, making sure HE does HIS business since puppyhood...Whoops!
I swear this gets reposted somewhere every single day.

Cute dog tho.
lol
Cloudy Floof luvs it’s human
Mine tries to drink the sudsy water and sing-whines the entire time I'm in the tub.

What breed is this dog ??
A stream was under this and the sound was on for it but not this, I got confused when it was saying “It’s really hot and swampy”
'sup?  WOOF
Hayato...
Do you mind if I join you?
We had a Boston Terrier named Zsa Zsa who absolutely hated taking a bath. Anytime anyone ran water in the bathtub, she would start shaking nervously. The shaking continued until she saw one of us get into the bathtub and then she could relax.  FYI - "relax" = trying to sleep under the bath towel we had laid out.
r/MildlyTerrifying
is your tub really tall?
Oh hi there...
That made me go aawwwhahaww.
😂
aaaw i love this pupper
If I get a dog and s/he doesn’t do this, I don’t want it.
Pet the dog Karen
Cute baby
not this one again... and again... and again...
No one who thinks that is right.
Sammy's are awesome
This thing gets posted once a week and is always one of the top posts
This is all too familiar having an almost 1 year old son.
Why does that bath water look filthy?
What kind of dog is that?

I have two samoyeds. This is accurate.

Hello! I love you!

- dog's exact quote.
Suddenly doge
Hello fluffy doggo.
Pupper: Hi! You okay in there?
Suntory time
I have two cats. I haven't had alone time in the restroom for years. I have one cat the really loves to get pets when I am on the toilet. He also loves being in between the shower curtain and liner when I take a shower. The other one demands pets everywhere else but is petrified of water. He will still get jealous of toilet pets though and barge in. 

And no, I can't close my door. Howling and door clawing will happen. It's more peaceful to leave the door open.

The perfect "what cha doin?" face.
Hello there homan
“I miss you.”
Why is the water so dirty?
That's a beautiful samoyed(?)
How dirty were you when you got it? Thats some brown ass water.
(: ?
I was expecting something worst.
Okay, I audibly "awwwww'd" at this. Good fluffy puppy.
WHAT DOING?
The best humans
What is polar bear doing there?
“are you almost done?”
This is my ideal spa day.
My youngest pup is attached to what some would call an unhealthy level. When I’m in the tub be just sits at the edge and screams at me until I get out.
This gave me straight: GoL ...
Brek nek time
haha radical

Oof! Or should I say ‘floof’?
🤣😂
90 degrees of confusion
Also, me in the shower. Or me anywhere.
Your post is the first internet thing that managed to make me laugh today. Take this upvote!!!
Ok this is cute the second time I watched it knowing it’s a dog on its side, but the first time it panned over I though it was some formless fluff ball with 1 eye and it caught me off guard
I thought this was cute and then I checked the profile annnd 𝘖𝘩 𝘥𝘦𝘢𝘳 𝘭𝘰𝘳𝘥

I can tell you right now the steam is stank in that room.
What a cutie. Love this
I love when my cat does this
So cute!!
What kind of dog is that
Lol way too much on this one. Thanks for sharing this.
LOL
What a beautiful Sammy 🎈🐾
Washing off all that wonderful stinkiness, and after all that hard work he did getting you to smell like dog, he's right yo be offended.
I'm sure its just angles, but is that the tallest tub ever?
What breed is this? It’s adorable!
Crosspost to r/samoyeds
😂❤️
That fur baby is adorable!!
He/she is gorgeous!! I totally get it, it could be 3am and as soon as I shut the door I hear doors opening and knocking. During the day one of my 6 kids is either knocking or walking in. Then my 160lb pit mix is opening the door and peeking in or the cats open the door and want to climb on my lap and talk. Never a dull moment.....
So adorable
They are just the most innocent looking breed
Literally melted my heart!
There's just so much love there😭
"Oh, nice big bubbly water box, got room for me? Ah you know u do!"

- Dog
Oh Hiiii!
Still cute after all this time.
Weirdest loofa i have ever seen

Awe so cute !!

Fluffy boy confused why you would subject yourself to this.

This is something my dog would do! Anytime you need to find her, find my feet!
Oh my god, that is adorable. I love Samoyeds.
"You actually enjoy this?" - Dog probably
"...HAI..."
Henlo
Relaxing time with good boi is the best time

Im so glad that there are no furry bathtub fetish comments. Hopefully this doesn’t jinx it
