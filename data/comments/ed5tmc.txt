...so maybe i'll just rest my head

until you take a break . . . . .

then maybe we can go to bed

So cute! I miss having a kitty
‚ÄúI should *not* have just liked her selfie from 3 years ago.‚Äù
Is warm. I put head here.
She tried to stay up with you! üò∏
You do like me I can see. Raising your laptop with a bunch of books to get the screen in a more comfortable height (I assume at least).
Your cat's battery is low, charge him.
A good use of books there, comrade!
Is your cat asleep or is he pressing his head against the laptop? Make sure it isn't the last one: https://m.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_headpressing
Life is tough when you're a baby mountain lion.
I can relate to whatever he‚Äôs going through
My cat would ko the screen and sleep on it and force me to pet them with the powers of cuteness.
Awesome! He/she reminds me of a puma!
He is absorbing all of the knowledge
shhhhhh he/she is charging! ;)
What kind of cat is it?
Connection to life: failed
That‚Äôs true love right there
Wow that's one expensive laptop stand.
When a cat does this it might be because it's ill. Try to take note if he/she does this often and against other things like walls, sofas etc. Then take him/her to a vet to get a check up.
Roger why can't you do it right?
I would be careful with the books underneath the laptop, looks like they are covering the fan, could bring you problems
Looks like OP copied this off of TikTok. This is not their cat.
It is very cuet
His only Appointment is DisAppointment. Track pad, no mouse.
This poster is a liar. That‚Äôs not his cat, he took the video from someone off douyin. 


[original video link ](https://v.douyin.com/44n1CL/)
Sometimes when kitties sleep like this it's a sign of head trauma :c.  Very cute but just keep an eye on cutie to make sure they're not exhibiting any strange behaviors.  Happy holidays ^^

Kitty just wants to keep you company for as long as it can. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is cat broken?
My dog did something very similar when I was studying in law school. I‚Äôd sit on the couch with a laptop, notebook, and textbook open. He‚Äôd jump on the couch and slowly inch his way over to me. Slowly but methodically, he would eventually lay down on top of the text book, full spread. Torts were never more comfortable. 

He knew I needed a break. I would guess your cat knows the same for you.
Is he asleep or is it a dramatic protest.
I think your cat crashed
Are you sure *you* did the work?
Hey, being a cat is hard work and requires a lot of sleep!

I seem to remember reading something about observing your cat pressing its forehead into a wall being a symptom of some type of ailment?  Obviously I cant remember much of what I'm talking about, but I hope this isnt something this cat does often, and they were just tired.
Did you turn it off and back on again?

The cat is probably thinking I feel your pain! I want to be rubbed and watch a movie but your busy working.
Careful.  Animals putting their heads against walls/objects can actually mean something is seriously wrong with them.    If it was a one time thing because of the heat it's no big deal.  If your cat was putting its head against more than just the keyboard than it probably has a very serious health issue that you should check out ASAP.  Otherwise if it was just for the heat then it's all good.
Yeah...this doesn't look like a normal faceplant, it looks like they're headpressing and that can be a sign of something life threatening.

Please keep an eye on your cat and make sure they're not pressing against any walls like this regularly.

Source: https://m.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/how-treat-head-pressing-cats
If your cat presses it's head against things a lot (not head rubbing, but pressing like here), it might be because of a health problem. I hate to be the party pooper, but I wanted to make sure you knew, in case your kitteh is sick <3

Hey OP if this is your OC I'd like to point out that placing your laptop on books like this could cause it to overheat. Many newer macbooks use the case as a heatsink so those little rubber bits underneath leave an air gap for good cooling.

That‚Äôs a small mountain lion.
Hell yeah, GIMP forever!
USB See?
I like your cat. üêà üê±
It looks a little broken, I hope you still have the receipt
Praying you get your work done
I'd be a tad bit more concerned. There is a thing called "head pressing" in cats and it can be a sign of something wrong. Might need to schedule a vet visit.
That fur baby loves you so much!
Lol awwwww. Fell asleep?
I outloud awww‚Äôd
Goodness. What an angel
I want to see what op is drawing though!!
Me after college exams
Iz tyme fur sleeping.
Funny how our fur babies, try so hard to be at our sides all the time. However bed time is simply bed time lol. My pup is the same way as your kitty lol
Your cat is me.
Was it really sleeping in that position? Sometimes cats press their heads to when they have health issues. I mean if it is awake or does this more than once a comment from the vet may be requested.
I want to see his cute face now!
I think it's trying to turn off the computer
Head pressing can be a sign of poisoning.
Omg. Put that kitty to bed and please go with.
I have never seen a post with this many upvotes before

This cat is a real one... will grind with you even when tired
i recently leveled up enough at work that i was given a laptop (my main box at work runs windows 10 but i needed to run ubuntu on something and i'll be damned if i'm going to be stuck running it as a subsystem on windows). i've brought it home a few times and done some work from the couch. kitty, who is very much a needy lap kitty, is having trouble adjusting to his new competition. previously he only had to spar with my boyfriend's head for lap space.
He was trying to shit your laptop off with his head. That's where my power button is lol.
reminds me of me at work..... hard to get those key indentations out of my forehead.
*DearGod,Make them turn this thing off.*
Is your cat in pain? Any weird symptoms going on?
Hooman - why you not doin a snooze. Look, I show you!
You little fur baby just wants to show luv
Did you try turning the cat off and back on again?

And... that is me trying to read before sleep...
Why in the name of all that is holy were you working with a laptop stacked on 5 books
This makes me think of homer Simpson  saying 'dou' for some reason
Cat: I swear that bitch got me fucked up....
Please hooman, come to bad...is too late...üòÇü§£üòÇ thanks for posting!!!

ZZzzzzZZzzzzZZZzzzZZZZzzz
That‚Äôs how I feel, was up writing a term paper up until 5:30am
Lightroom tends to do this to my cat too... what gives?
My wife said that cats do that when they have headaches.
Aww
For any non-cat people out there who want an explanation: cats are little weirdos
Yea a few times I wake up extremely early to get some studying done and my kitty tries to give me moral support but she's so sleepy
You‚Äôre cat looks like me doing work at night
Sleepy baby was trying to stay awake with you

It's a Mac mind meld. Cat's gonna wake up a lot more expensive and will then loudly ask for proprietary add-ons.

I love the custom notebook stand
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I ate your mouse‚Äù
Relatable
He is ready for bed think he is trying to tell you something lol
Why is your laptop on a stack of books?
Wait doesn't that mean that the cat is some kind of pain or distress??
So true...

I'm surprised a cat would stay up late with it's owner. I just assumed them being so independent, that they'd just go to their bed, and leave you up on your own.
the cat was trying to find the mouse

Oh my cuteness. How precious and adorable
Love the stack of books. Way to be ergonomic
*cracks open a white claw*
This looks like Pressing to me. Might wanna get him checked out. I'm probably wrong though.
When your cat falls asleep questioning its life choices

"God dammit John, not this fuckin' song again. One of these days I'm going to leave you"
‚ÄúI should not have just liked her selfie from 3 years ago.‚Äù
He went catatonic.
I think that's a sign the cat is sick and should be seen by a vet immediately.
Isn't a cat putting its head against something hard a bad sign? You might need to see a Vet.
I has a nap.

"cat.exe" is not responding.

Have you tried turning it off and on?
Trying to get you to go to bed, she's trying to push the power button but lacks the fingers / dexterity to do so.  She's just thinking of your health.  Good kitty.  Btw, that's a beautiful cat pattern and colors, what type of kitty is she?
Purrfect study buddy.
Same cat... same...
OP, I don't mean to cause panic, but that's not a cat, that's a mini-mountain lion!!!
Same.
Is your cat a baby Puma?
I feel you cat, I feel you. I'm having one of those days.
Bro he is using the og $1000 laptop stand
