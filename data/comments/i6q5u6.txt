I'm a little upset he the squirrel didn't use the silverware,  it's just good manners.
Hope you get a good tip
Me, eating out by myself
Set 2 meals next time so they can have a luxurious date
How adorable
I had a long-haired cat who one day purposefully dipped the tip of his tail into a candle flame.  Some of the hair lit and then with a little poof the tail went out.  He did it again and the same thing happened.  Then he dipped closer to the base of his tail into the flame and suddenly his whole tail went up.  Then I got to chase a flaming, screaming cat through the house while visions of the house burning to the ground because of my stupidity danced in my head.  He was absolutely fine.  So was the house.  I knew where my towel was and I used it well.

My husband came home and the house smelled like burnt hair so he lit a candle and the cat did it again. 

As soon as I saw that little candle I envisioned a flaming squirrel dashing through the trees.
If this is interesting to you....check out this video from Mark Rober. I have a new appreciation for squirrels.

So my mom feeds squirrels all the time in the backyard and I‚Äôve noticed this like mouth discoloration effect recently with all the squirrels , I wonder if it‚Äôs just wet mouth fur or something normal but it‚Äôs been bugging me and I noticed this little guy having the similar look, anyone know??

Just like during a flights. Airline companies think humans as squirrels confirmed.
I thought that was going to be a table for OP.  Unless OP is a squirrel.
I know it shouldn't bother me, but I really want to move that spoon to its rightful position on the outside.
How can I download this video? I need to send it to everyone I know
Honestly one of the best things to come out of the pandemic was these things going viral
[removed]
Open up a restaurant, please.
fuck them tree rat ass motherfuckers. I have my first garden going in a decade.  was excited to pull my first garden tomato yesterday, only to find one of those fluffy tailed plague carriers had chewed into the back side of it. I bought a pellet gun today. this will not happen again.
"I know you're recording me, Carl. You know damn good and well this is beneath the both of us. You're lucky I'm so godamn hungry. "
Too cute lol
OMG, that is so cute!
You are very strange lol
Is this Mark Rober's house?
the fork goes on the left, and the knife goes inside the spoon, you monster!
Very cool but also, you might be losing it, mate.
Mark rover has taught you well

These cutesy squirrel feeders make me think: Do you figure a squirrel has the cognitive capacity to think, "The shit I gotta put up with..."?
Reminds me of this (well actually I just like this https://youtu.be/hFZFjoX2cGg)
was anyone else half expecting a squirrel-catapult ending?
Social distancing
So a naked midget can sit on top and have his balls hang through the hole?
You have been good with tamagochi back in the years i guess.
There's actually a YouTube channel that uses this "table for one" product to bait and snipe tree rats.
The squirrel burns it self later
u/2kayzm
Nek minute youve got a squirrel on fire running around
Worlds smallest milking table.
Very cute, except for the combination of Squirrel + Open Flame.
Careful, the little bugger will take the candle

Do you want to be responsible for giving squirrels the power of FIRE!?

I don't think so
Omg üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
Dont feed the squirrels!
he looks like a bruce
As i was watching this "Sweet Thing" (remix) by Mary J Blige came on the radio and it totally fit
classy
The suspense was great, waiting to see what lil cutie was gonna chow down there. Not disappointed, couldn't upvote fast enough, awww
If you follow Chunk the Groundhog on Instagram his family has a similar picnic table.
That is adorable
That's a well made squirrel
What type of squirrel is this? I don't think I've ever seen one with a black muzzle.
Edgun leshy has a different perception of that table for one
Oh nyooo hes alone ;(
He didn‚Äôt even use the utensils, what an animal smh
r/AnimalsBeingHuman
I really appreciate the work and thought you put into this. It's adorable.
"You seated me at a patio seat in the rain without an umbrella. Expect this to be taken out of the tip."
If you put a life-sized picnic table with a candle and a bowl of nuts out, I will come and sit there too. Just sayin'. Bring the nuts.
\*coyote hides behind bush with net\* come on birdy birdy
I don‚Äôt really give a shit about squirrels, but the dude who made this is definitely going to heaven. Super sweet.
Awh I feel bad that he has no one to communicate with.
We have a tiny squirrel table for corn (dried) on one of our trees. They love it. They also love chewing on the table though...
He all alone tho :( i wanna join him
A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, ‚Äútable for one?‚Äù How is this possible?
ewok squirrel
YEEEEEEES. I KNEW WHERE THIS WAS GOING AND WAS STILL SO HAPPY WITH THE END
So you're one of the fuckers who bought this online before I could, eh?!
omg why so cute!
That‚Äôs adorable. The outdoor cat who has adopted us has also adopted a squirrel. I‚Äôm going to have to set out some treats for the little guy.
I like that he‚Äôs just munching away instead of the usual smash and grab those little bastards do
Thank you, garson. And may I see the wine list please.
Where is his tiny little cocktail?  That squirrel needs a drink!  Now he‚Äôs going to leave a bad review on Yelp due to poor service.
Yo! How about some water over here..
Burned mouth from candle. Thanks.
My day has been made by this smol squirrel
Cute - although the added salt kills over time.
If it‚Äôs gray it stays. If it‚Äôs red it‚Äôs...
Sir, this is a dining room, you can‚Äôt just shit on the floor.
Wish I had enough confidence to eat by myself in public.
If this isn't the cutest!
This some Snow White shit
Poor lonely squirrel.
Gerc√≥n, check pls
That‚Äôs very cute sir what you did there ^^
I dislike how close the legs are. Feels unbalanced.
Now that‚Äôs just cute.
i love that it's sitting at the table lol
I love this so much.
Just don‚Äôt eat the moldy jam.
Olive Garden got the sweet views and some weird guests nowadays...
I need this in my life, where can I get one?
Ah yes. A fine man in troublesome times.
By the way that's legit really cool
What'd the swuirrel say to this straight up shit kicker of a caregiver?  
  Cash ew ou'Side.
I need a update on how he‚Äôs doing
Awww‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Lil' Bits
That's it I'm going to become a woodworker
He looks lonely but is actually having the time of his life.
Omg so adorable and wholesome
What an animal, using his hands when the silverware is right next to him. Disgusting!
Crum crum crum
Beautiful thank you for being so kind to one of Gods creatures!   I enjoyed that thank you!
üòç I love squirrels.
Squirrel: "This is nice."
Did you go out there with your flamenco guitar and play a little "Squirrel From Ipanema" for him?
Ole boy was side eyeing the whole time
That‚Äôs adorable!!!!
See, quarantine is good for something. No way this happens on a day anyone attends a game.
Mark Rober, are you and Fat Gus bored again?
Did you get the idea from Mark Rober? Awesome table btw :)
Table for one hobbit
This one wasn‚Äôt...
Awee
thats sooo cute!!!!!
this hits too close to home
That's a cool looking squirrel! I hope you get more footage of he/her!
My wife does this every morning. Except it's for 2 chipmunks that have their own tables. Dale and Peanut await breakfast every day. They've also been known to argue on our feet, literally. Gotta make sure to wear shoes.
I was watching and out loud, more than once, said "This better be a dog!" 

Yet this chonky monching squirrel was more than acceptable.
I‚Äôm sure he went nuts when he got the bill.
This made me chuckle, then a little sad he was dining alone
Sneaky bastard.
is so cute
Barbarian - didn‚Äôt even use the utensils or napkin!
Awe
this would make such a nice mini charcuterie board
he single?
Hope we see reservations for 2
comically small spoon
/u/vredditshare
Now we wait for the video of someone trying to put their dick in this.
Oh so cute!
I adore all the cute and crazy things people have come up with to keep busy and entertain themselves during this awful crisis. The enduring human spirit gives us all hope. If we can still smile and be creative and kind to one another (fur babies included) we can get through anything. Thanks for sharing!
Okay. Fuck you. That was cute.
I wonder if he'll squirrel it away for another dayüêøüêøüêøüêøüêø
Who else looking to fuck that table at the start?
My heart is melting! üòç
It's all fun and games till the squirell start using spoon and fork.
Is that phat gus?
Getting schwifty at dinner
Nice
I think squirrels are cute and I‚Äôm tired of pretending that they‚Äôre not
u/millimak
Please glue a little plastic wine glass filled with water.
One is the loneliest number...
Hehehe that's adorable
Is this a table used for milking squirrels?
Supposed to be on a fence. Recycled idea.
The perfect trap to sneak up behind him and put two in his head. Leave my woodpecker cakes alone!!!!!!

...sorry I‚Äôm going through a thing.
Man I really, really, REALLY fucking wish my country had squirrels. I know they can be a pest... but it's worth it.
"10/10 service, would munch here again"
You bored, stupid, magnificent, inspiring bastard... ;)
I already knew this was gonna be a wholesome moment from before I watched the video
We don't deserve animals
Did he at least tip you well?
Awwwww
Do not show this to r/fatsquirrelhate
Was expecting this to be an r/wewantplates experience.
No beer with his nuts?! No tip!
You should post this on r/humansbiengbros
That's nuts
R/mademesmile
toilet
I worked in fine dining for a long time, and have set thousands of table settings. it‚Äôs driving me fucking nuts that the spoon is in the middle.
The hole is for milking
Adorable!
Omg this is just the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all day!
don‚Äôt let r/fatsquirrelhate see this one
Cool table.  I want a few for my squirrels.
No elbows on the table and use your cutlery!!!!
I thought it was a table for milking.
Use walnuts, squirrels love them.
Ugh. Take my vote.
He‚Äôs not even sitting in the right side of the table or using any of his silverware. What an animal.
Why didn‚Äôt it use the cutlery
Dinner for one
!remindme 16h
Did OP just give a squirrel a knife? **DID OP REALLY JUST GIVE A SQUIRREL A KNIFE?**

Everybody, save yourselves.
Get this guy a partner.
Cutlery layout is wrong tho
mmmmm yes sir squirrel
üòÇüòÇ
Awwww
*french music intensifies*
ü§£ üëèüèª
So freaking adorable, I almost forgot to breathe for a moment. . .
....did I leave the stove on??
So sad... A candle on the table but no date :'(
I‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying
Guss
Thank you for making me guffaw...
Made my day :)
Mark Rober's video's suggest using walnuts over peanuts. Allegedly, squirrels like walnuts more!
Could be Gus from Mark Robers garden
*forbidden fleshlight*
This is way too cute for me (¬¥‚äôœâ‚äô`)
Someone please send this to Garrett watts
Aww he needs a date üêøü•úüïØ
Oh sure it‚Äôs cute when a squirrel eats alone but when I do it it‚Äôs sad and pathetic...
I thought it was a mini milking table at first...
I love this.. covid tsught me how much i love feeding the neighborhood woodland creatures.
The sad moment you realise that you are the squirrel üòÖüòµ
Top content on here. So refreshing to see something that is not just somebody‚Äôs stupid kid
SO....

I was feeding the squirrels outside my window in my apartment building. Sandy squirrel would come by every morning and tap on the window to wake me up to feed her. Next thing I know, she found a way to get into my attic via the vent pipe from the roof and she made a new home and ran around over my head all winter long. I had to put a stop to feeding her and actually chicken wire up the vents. I felt terrible for feeding her in the first place and I hope she is ok. She is old, fat, and had her ear chewed off from a fight she had when she was younger. Still, she would always come by to look for me. TLDR never feed squirrels. It's not fair to them. It's one thing to toss food out on the ground, but this little table here will make her come back looking for more.
I thought it was oneplus 7T case first
Clearly there is space for a second squirrel. I want to see two at the table pleeeease
My hesrt!!!!
Get my gun.
I love it, but it's seriously lacking in squirrel footage.
I hate that mafaka
Cute and clever, yet I can't help but think this is a bad use of time and skills.  I see a special made table for a rat with a fluffy tail. Oh well, if they enjoy it I guess.
