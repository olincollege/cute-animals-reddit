Those are some very big bears and some very small fences.
It has been observed by wildlife biologist how intelligent bears are, especially grizzly bears. Their problem solving skills are quite excellent. Biologists theorize some bears have an intelligence level that approaches that of great apes.
The last one was my favorite.
Dat catch tho
Yogi's gotten lazy
This is my problem with bears, they look like these big, fat, fluffy dogs that you just wanna hug but I have to remind myself that they‚Äôre one of the most dangerous apex predators in North America
For a second my dumb ass thought the bear said ‚ÄûSee you guys later‚Äú in the last one smh
Beary cute
Used to play for the Cubs.
been to something like this called a gamefarm.  Was kind of a fucked uo place. you drove along a road and wild animals would walk near your car and you'd pay for loafs of bread to feed them. Those that roamed free were fine and I assume somehow were trained not to leave the game farm's compond but they also had wild cats in cages where you could view from a far distance and they never left their tiny little cages.  the bears were just like in the video.  would sit and wave for bread.  Hopefully they were given better food but they all ate bread literally nonstop all day.
Looks familiar, is this the olympic game farm in washington state?  Should have worked on my bread tossing skills...
The cutest killing machines
I know this place. It's in my hometown where I used to live. They have very small fences for all of their animals, and most of them are retired circus and film animals. These bears are trained to do all sorts of things, that's why they catch the bread and wave. It's a drive in zoo, basically. A lot of it is really cool, but the area the rhino lives in is especially sad. It's was basically a shed with a wooden fenced area that was about the size you'd normally have for a pig. You could see the poor things ribs.
Man, this is a tough job. Not many of us can spend hours in that heavy bear costume to make a living.
Last bears wave is the best
Hey there Boo Boo!

Can you smell a pic-a-nic basket?
u/gifreversingbot
Ahhh worth it: https://gfycat.com/singleidenticaldog
Hey I know this bear! He lives at the Olympic Game Farm in Sequim, Washington. It's a drive through animal reserve. The bears are actually trained and were used in Disney movies. They are now retired and live at the reserve. They do wave and love to catch the bread which you can buy at the front gate by the loaf. There are also llamas, zebras (2, I think), tigers and wolves (caged), elk, reindeer, and bison along the route. The carnivores are separate from the travel path but the herbivores are free to roam and will straight up stick their head in your car for bread. You can quickly find yourself swarmed if you don't keep a steady slow pace, which can be fun in itself until the bison that are as large as your midsize sedan. It's a blast to visit and they do rehab for animals and help find permanent homes and even releases for some like the tigers and wolves. Definitely worth the drive if you live in Washington or you are visiting! I highly recommend using a dash cam pointed inside the vehicle to capture people's reactions. :)
Not gonna lie that catch was hella dope. But don't be feeding bears!
Tfw you wave at a gif.
That second bear just straight up nae naed
Did they feed that bear a slice of bread?!
100% these bears are trying to make the gesture where you draw your hand across your throat indicating what's coming for the observer.
Sometimes I don't get it. How can something be so cute and ferocious at the same time?
Âë®Êù∞ÂÄ´-‰∏ÉÈáåÈ¶ô
Oh shit that's the bear from Tekken.
So I could be wrong about this but I thought it was thing that you are NEVER supposed to feed bears human food. This is due to the fact they acquire a taste for it and then pillage houses for it. Am I wrong in this?
Looks like smokey here would make a pretty good third baseman, if he could only learn to throw to first instead of eating the ball.
/u/vredditshare
When Bears wave they're actually doing what a dog does when they swipe their paw in your direction they're saying they want food.
I believe these are retired bears that were in films. 
Not sure though
It's a damn shame I cannot be friends with a real bear and cuddle
It amazes me how people can say how the place looks bad and stuff without any kind of knowledge of it, it‚Äôs not the keepers fault or the owners of the animals are unfit and not well nourished, the workers and owner have put in countless hours into the place, owner selling his businesses, workers working for free, but people bring in food from Walmart instead of buying the bread that is specially made for the animals, it‚Äôs the visitors that do that and then complain about the place, and the place is literally a retirement home for the animals, the animals used to be in films or as pets and raised in captivity, you can‚Äôt just let a bear out into the wild when it gets fed everyday
Fucking bullshit, wildlife belongs in the wild.

Bears have no right to be that fucking cute and while also being able to rip your head clean off your shoulders
Does this mean that bears can play Frisbee?

/r/bearswaving

it's a thing!
I need a hug from a bear right now.
It's likely that these are rescued from circus attraction zoos that have trained them to wave.
/r/bearsdoinghumanthings
They can catch a flying salmon with relative ease. Why wouldn‚Äôt a piece of bread be any challenge?
Lol I'm watching Ted the movie while scrolling reddit and this came up. My brain did a 360
Jumped on here real quick saw this and will that is hilarious great hand eye coordination.
Aight imma head out heres in my room x10
Hi Bear!
I bet the Bears wish they had a WR with hands like that.
Might be the best catch I have seen a Bear make in the past year. Hopefully its a better season this year.
Thank you, I needed that today. Reminder to go out with a mask and protest your corrupt government and demand they work for working people this weekend.
Better receiver than anyone on the Chicago Bears
Weird use of Jay Chou song
My villagers whenever I leave their house
Whenever I see videos of bears doing human things I always think of the bear that tried to rummage through a dumpster and racked himself right in the balls with some sort of cable, and his reaction was so human I die every time I see it
Those are the most polite bears I‚Äôve seen since my last visit to a gay bar.
"With hands that fast, he could play fo.."  
"dont do it."  
"He could play for th..."  
"I'm warning you."  
"He could play for the bears!"  
"god damnit."
He barely caught it
The first bear had Odell Beckham hands
Bears are just big puppies change my mind
I have been convinced for years that if bears had thumbs they would dominate any sport.
Nothing in the rule book says a bear can't play football.
I need a hug
hmmmmmm this bear is somehow just relaxing under the heat of the sun without any worries.
Can I have an animated version of this with Ursaring please thank you
Time to get that bread?
It makes me want a bear as a pet

But then I realize just how bad of an idea that is
This is sweet, but it also immediately reminds me of the dreaded bear park that was in Helen GA. The bears were very animated, but it was because they were constantly underfed as a ploy to keep people buying fruit and bread to feed them. Very Tiger King, very happy the bears were relocated to an open park with overhead walkway in Colorado.
‚ÄúCome back soon, I wanna eat your face‚Äù
Wow
..  that's an awesome video!  Thanks it made me laugh!  That is a small fence for such big bears !
C H O N K Y  B E A R
A while ago in Yellowstone tourists used to feed the bears by hand I just wanted to mention that because I thought that was cool
Random Jay Chou playing in the background of a bear video just works
Lmao the bear reminds me of my 6‚Äù4‚Äù dad when I was little he would talk like scooby doo and wave all floppy like that at me when he dropped me off at school. Big lovable bears.
I don‚Äôt know why the bears waving makes me super uncomfortable
Are we sure these aren't people in bear suits?
Tyson he probably knew a few people
That could turn into a grizzly situation real quick
Just bearly caught it.
Move over r/birdsarentreal
sad zoo bears doing tricks for food.. not really AWWW... more like saddddd
Smarter than the average bear!
That first bear really needs to be on someone's Ultimate Frisbee team.

ANNOUNCER: "Welcome to the WFDF World Ultimate Club Championship! Let's meet our teams. Heeeeeeeeeere's SEATTLE RIOT! With team members  Blakemore, Schmidt, Zayas, Meseck, Halmos, Roth, and A GODDAMN BEAR! What's this? It looks like the other team is running for the locker rooms. Looks like SEATTLE RIOT are your champions this year!"
I agree with Stephen Colbert: Bears are godless killing machines.

But this is pretty great.
Wow, I've never seen this before! (/S)
I've been here. It's fucking great. The llamas were assholes though. They blocked the road forever, and tried to get us to give them all of our bread. We barely had enough for the bison, who were chasing down the car, looking for snacks.
Yes my species is friendly like any other when we are not being HUNTED by your kind! üò†

Good one üòÑ
Send him to Frisbee trials
I wish I could save videos off of reddit also
I‚Äôve never wanted to play catch with a bear before. Until now

It would be beary dangerous if those bears just broke down those small fences. Thankfully they seem beary furlite.

Best thing seen on reditt today, thanks

How do you teach bears to wave?
Looks like a deepfake
I literally just had that big Andy Dwyer happy surprise smile when the bear waves back.
I want to hug them!
I‚Äôm moving to an area where bears are known to come into backyards. I shall try this from my window
Bear Country, SD???
This makes me sad.
What is the music playing in the background?
That's some overstable bread right there
oi, gimmie more
The only time I remember going there was when I was like 4 and a bison stuck its head in the window with its tongue out and yeah it scared the hell out of me.
Someone post that clip of the old fella waving on the gameshow...

I guess yogi bear was real after all
That is awesome! üòÄ So adorable creature.
One of the bears is a frisbee master, and all the others are just happy wave bois
Omg I always feel kinda sad seeing animals in cages/fences.... but this was cute I would be so psyched if the bear caught my bread too lol
Its really cute until it walks over that fence and has your trachea in its hand.

Do bears actually reciprocate waves or have they just learned that they get more food when they wave their paws at humans?
 I love how bears can be some of the cutest animals and some of the most badass and deadly. One of my favorite animals. Also they look like my dog so I love them even more just for that.
I could watch that bear catch the bread frisbee 1000 times and still be entertained
The bears are learning too much. Soon they may replace the human race

Is this the Olympic Game Farm??
Bye! I want to eat you! I mean...nice to meet you!
What the hell are their hands doing after the bear catches the thing??? Do you see that??? It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to solve a rubix cube
Thank you for this
I honestly think bears show up in early human civilization so often, and have such strong roles as sacred or spirit animals across cultures, because they are so incredibly human.
r/likeus
That last bear said "Toodles!"
Bears repeating.
For some reason this video just made me more scared of bears.
Glove save and a beauty!
Rasshen Bear
I guess Jim was wrong. Black bear isn't the best kind of bear.
It makes me sad that bears are so incredibly deadly (if they want to be) because they are so ridiculously adorable.
Now keep in mind that the fence won't do shit against the bear and that they can easily open up car doors in a few seconds if they really want to.

When you park your car in Yosemite and leave food in your car, you can expect it to be broken into by a bear some time later. The bears decide that it's too much of a hassle to eat you when you drive through there. You don't have a say in that matter.
Bearry nice catch

I know I'm late to the party, but a lot of people are saying that they're from the area and know the place, that it's not very good. If you're from the area, the Animal Legal Defense Fund has a [form](https://aldf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Roadside-Zoo-Checklist-Worksheet.pdf) you can fill out so it's on their radar for Roadsize zoos.
They‚Äôre dogs I swear
Detroit Tigers fan here.  Really hoping they sign that first bear.  But he'll probably go to the Cubs.
Typical behavior for bears in captivity. They know people throw them food if they wave. Sad to see.

Of all the feats in this video, I argue that accurately shuriken-throwing a slice of bread right into a bear's face is the most impressive.
wonderful!
This takes place at a bear enclosure for retired circus bears or bears that aren't strong enough to live in the wild anymore. They're pretty much harmless and they learned that if they wave they get food most of the time.
üêª = üêï
Society needs to stop glorifying bears as these cute cuddly creatures. They‚Äôre fucking monsters who will tear your face right off of its face and eat you. Likely while you‚Äôre still alive. They don‚Äôt go for the jugular like a mountain lion would. A bear will beat the fuck out of you and you‚Äôll feel every bit of it.
Those poor bears living in a confined environment for human entertainment.
Love how none of these people realize that the only thing between them and the bear is a skinny ass fence
Can we stop sharing videos that show people feeding animals? In the zoo or not, people shouldn‚Äôt be feeding animals.
Roses are red...
These bears are living in suffering. Almost no exercise it looks like, overweight, probably riddled with disease, clearly unable to fend for themselves in the wild, desensitized to humans, this is disgusting.
