Just a heads up to future dog owners. Human names are hilarious. But give them a funny last name, only if it is to hear the vet office say, "we are just calling to confirm Frederick Cuddlebuns appointment for Tuesday at 230."

They laugh everytime we bring him in. 
How many carnival games does it take to win a Phil?
