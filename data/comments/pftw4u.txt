The cutest is the jump to him having a collar.
There are tiny paw prints set in the concrete of my apartment’s parking lot. I want to believe their origin is from a situation like this.
This raccoon likes this man more than my cat likes me
"One day I'm gonna grow up to be like dad!"

\- this little guy
The music stopped for a second when he was at the top of the ladder and I thought this was going to take a sharp turn into a very different kind of video
Son, you must learn how to fix the transmission.
I'm here to make a complaint that this video ended toooooooo soon
I’m trying to figure out what this man’s job title is and the only thing I can come up with is “Man”
Well, that makes me feel like a lazy ass
I hear they're great until they reach adulthood. Then the wild instincts kick in and the ride is over.
Opportunity there for a new web comic:  Baby raccoon… with a circular saw.
I know this is very cute. But for those of you who want your own little baby racoon you should know that they have a very strong odor and will definitely stink up your whole house. it isn't like a dog or a cat. If you pet it or hold it you gotta take a shower.
For those wondering, they really will follow you everywhere when they’re young. When they got too far from me, I called and stomped my feet a tad harder so they could hear me leaving and the whole gang would run after me. Also, they touch, grab, and stash everything. You can’t just take stuff away from them or they learn to hide it in their mouths with one hand while running with the other 3. You pretty much have to trade them one interesting item or food for whatever they already have.
I also want a striped dog with thumbs.
[removed]
Who else is planning to trap one tonight by their dumpster?

Anyone?  No, just me then. Gotcha! Please send bandaids!
Possibly the cutest animal video ever.

What happens, though, when that adorable baby gets big enough to eat all those seedlings as they’re planted?
Please tell me he made little raccoon tools so it can help out with the building. And it wears a little yellow construction hat. And also a little raccoon safety vest.
Dad: We're NOT adopting this raccoon 

Dad and the Raccoon a minute later:
Rocket gets a dad
He came so close to crushing him with that cement block tho!
I’ve known people of that man’s demographic who would have hit that thing with a shovel day one. He loves that raccoon and he isn’t a single oz less tough because of it. Kindness is definitely a strength
It’s the animals that choose you that are always the best pets
I feel like based on his dead pan reaction that the raccoon just started following him one day. He’s never spoken about it.  It’s just there. He feeds it. Gives it medical attention.  But no eye contact.  He knows it needs to be free.   But he will take care of if it so long as it chooses to be around.
Weird cat
Pet raccoon sales are gonna go bonkers, ya'll.
No one is gonna compliment the Ra’coon dad on all the cool jobs he’s been doing? Awesome pet too!
Edit: added the ra, I had no idea it was racist.
I want a pet raccoon now
What an amazing little helper
Excuse me sir racoon, have you a work permit?- On a side note, this is adorable :)
Let me handle the saw daddy
I think someone loves their dad
As soon as I read the title my mind went somewhere dark
my grandfather had a pet racoon when I as a kid. His name was Rocky and he was totally awesome if my grandfather was around. If he wasn't around, Rocky was a total piece of shit and needed to be caged.
  
He would just knock everything over and try to get into the cabinets and tear stuff apart. When my grandfather was around or nearby, he acted just like a lap cat. let you pet him and play with him until he was done and then just walked away.
  
my grandmother hated that thing.
  
edit - grammar
A friend of mine found 2 orphaned baby coons and raised them. Kong and Cuddles were their names. They were great until they got big and were super protective of my friend. Couldn’t get within 20 feet of him.
He’s got his own pokemon
My husband and I have rehabilitated 4 baby raccoons before.  One set of 3 and then a single little girl.  

The set of 3 never got clingy like this but the single girl did before her release.  We started bring her to the park when she was old enough to go off on her own and she would hang out in the trees.  Then one day she stayed.  Made sure we picked a spot next to a little lake for her to fish.
Where is the raccoon's PPE?? Please get him a tiny high-vis vest, tiny hard hat, and tiny safety glasses STAT
Hi! Rehabilitation, shelter, and veterinary professional here. I raised two raccoons. They were almost hairless. The female's eye was severely infected. I named them Cornbread and Coleslaw.

They were released on my parents' property. We feed a troupe of 8 every evening now. They all take food from my hand.

Raccoons are literally some of the best, most entertaining, intelligent, social critters around.
There was a post about a guy that had raccoons visit him in his garage. Anyone has the link?
I DONT WANT THIS VIDEO TO END... MORE!
The only son never yelled at because of holding the flashlight wrong
If that raccoon learns how to operate that circular saw, it'll be the end of civilization.
My wife and I just moved into a new house that has a grape vine in the backyard. One night we heard rustling and saw a raccoon munching on some grapes. Over the course of a few weeks he got more and more comfortable with us and would come out of his hiding spot to get grapes and then just stare at us. We named him Billy and always loved seeing him come out and eat grapes. One Sunday I woke up and looked out the window to see Billy laying in the grass. He had died at some point during the night. I put a sheet over him, dug a grave in the back corner of the yard and buried my friend Billy with a few grapes. He was a good raccoon.
I laughed at the part where the little fella couldn’t get over the wall, and the lyrics were at “nothing’s gonna stop us”
[removed]
Where I grew up, it wasnt unheard of that country boys would adopt a baby racoon and care for them. They ARE 100% wild critters and you have to expect everything that comes with that, but they CAN be fantastic little buddies. You really do need to be able to take them anywhere, and you need to find them before they are more than a few days old for bottle feeding.  


But, good little buddies all in all.
That is absolutely adorable!
The raccoon is cute and all but this guy does it all!!!
Wish I knew the backstory to how he got a racoon follower.
He almost accidentally bashed the raccoon at the end with the concrete brick
anyone know the backstory to this?  Why is this barely weaned raccoon following this rather uncaring dude around ?
I just realised I have never really seen a baby racoon before this video lol
Best thing I’ve ever seen on Reddit
Glad he didn't just let it imprint on him then abandon it.
I have a raccoon friend, I give him cat food and he doesn’t get in the trash. I named him Ricardo. I really only fed him cause a coyote tore him up. Now he’s a fixture.
Usually I don't really like the music people add to their videos but this was acceptably adorable.
Does this guy have a cameraman, or camerawoman, just follow him around building sites in case something cute happens?

Of course if everyday is bring your raccoon to work day, then yep.
The amount of real work this guy does shames me.
I had a relationship like this with a squirrel when I was a kid! Rescued her after her nest fell out of our tree during a storm, kept her in a cage in our house for about a week until she was better, released her outside, and then for the rest of her life she would just hang out with us whenever we were outside. Would climb up our legs and sit on our shoulders and stuff. Super cute, her name was Loosey lol
Nice to see an apprentice that's so keen to learn
I really wish this guy lived with me. I desperately need a project guy to work around my house, this guy would be perfect.
If this were a sitcom i would watch it
How busy is this dude?, fuck, i'm lazy.
That's a hard workin' dude, right there. Good thing his apprentice is small enough to help in those tight areas.
As if the whole thing wasn’t worth it… the last second was a treat :”)
Ooohhhh. So cute.   I found an injured young raccoon on my property the other day.  Naturally I had dreams of nursing it back to health and having a semi tame raccoon living in my yard that would come visit me while I was on my deck.  I knew his injury was needing special care I could not provide though so I called a local rescue in my area and they came and got him.  Hope you are doing ok Mikey.
You know right when the raccoon clung to his leg he accepted this was a forever thing, possibly the cutest thing ever and just accepted it like “aight”
I had two pet raccoons for a bit. Adorable but boy do they stink. Named them Wolverine and Spiderman because one liked to claw the shit out of everything and the other would climb everything, even vertical surfaces.
its been a bit shit here in the uk - our Government have been perscuting an alpaca.  They dragged him away from his owner yesterday, scaring him witless and put him down. 

It broke my heart - this has fixed it again.

Thank you for that.

And RIP Geronimo.
I’m not really fond of raccoons but damn this was cool.   Little guy wanted to hang out and help!
My cat does this when I'm getting ready for work.
Awwww I want a baby trash panda
We had a family of raccoons nested in a big maple tree in our neighborhood, and I just learned that a neighbor hired a company to come evict them last week. They never bothered anyone except maybe knocking over a couple of compost bins on the city compost pick-up day. I'm still pissed the neighbor wouldn't just let them be.
Oh man, that cinderblock almost ended that raccoon. It's cute, but so dangerous to let it roam around at a construction site.
Awe
Thanks, I'll be watching this for the rest of the day.
“Please. Stop. Helping.” 😋
her name is reba, she came up on my tic tok this morning.. really cool.
It's such a cute animal, I like it when I see it
One of the few posts where the music makes it even better
Oh my gosh this video made my day! 😍
I love how he gets bigger as the video goes on
What song is that
What breed of cat is this?
That is a seriously handy man! See all the shit he knows how to do?? I can barely shuffle cards!
I don’t care what anyone says, raccoons are freaking adorable! They have people hands and are hilarious.
This was surprisingly adorable. And someone get this man a beer!
I was riding the last subway home years and years ago. I remember one of the passengers had a huge raccoon he was stroking while he vacantly stared at the seat infront of him. It was winter so the racoons fur was super lush and beautiful. I was kind of jealous because it looked so nice
I've raised up a few baby racoons and they do follow you like this constantly.
Such a cute baby!

But, I heard raccoons become rather assholey when they get a bit old.
Man, I would not be letting a raccoon that close to my tools -- or my seedlings.
Hopefully he doesn’t get yelled for holding the flash light wrong
Ughhhhh my heart. Always wanted a pet racoon. I know they can be destructive and this is something I've made peace with. Same with squirrels. And would also love a skunk.
I want a raccoon
Who knew raccoons were so loyal
Baby trash pandas are literally the cutest thing in the world
Cutest familiar ever
Omg this is the cutest shit I’ve ever seen. My husband is on board with a pet Rakon.
Can someone help me. We built a garden like this but the falls are slowly falling outwards. Does anybody know what that framing that he put around the edges is called so we can add that to ours?
Rocket Raccoon if he was raised by a carpenter
I wanted this video to go on for at least 10 more minutes.
For sometime I thought it was actually releasing Rocket's backstory.
Dayd, Dayd, Dayd! I’m hewping you now
Thanks for the reminder to revisit one of [my favorite reddit threads ever.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/54z4f7/will_pee_damage_tires/)
Aw.

Raccoons can be little terrorists but they can also be so cute.  Got a tree full of em at night that come down for snacks from me (and con my neighbors into giving em snacks) and to hang out with my cat.  They all seem to get along very well.
Those things get big.  I've seen some huge ones that must be three feet tall when standing up.  I imagine the guy's house is completely torn up.
We see this man building a extension on his property by himself with the help of a raccoon.
So cute

![gif](giphy|PQKlfexeEpnTq)
What a nice soul taking care of that baby.  Best I’ve seen today. :)
What kind of cats is that? I want one!
Man, that guy is busy.
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work.
That raccoon would be able to build a house before i do !
This is like the opening of a sitcom
Cute little trash panda.
Don’t play with the circular saw, tiny raccoon
No one's talking about that dad tho! Is there a thing he can't do?
This is one busy dude. I wish I had half his skills. With the raccoon or at building sh!t.
The title of this post definitely tricked me into the wrong frame of mind.
Ay bro. That title sounds wrong.
Damn, now I know I'm getting old.  because my main thought was; "Wow buddy, that's a lot of really nice looking lumber for plant beds."
So wholesome. Just a man and his Coon
At first the video was kind of low quality and I thought it was an alligator
Pet raccoons are great until they pull all the keys off your laptop and wash them in the dog bowl.
Who would thought trash pandas like DeWalt
Baby trash panda!
Now that is too damn cute!
I'm helping!
My grandma had a pet raccoon for a while.  It got to be about 40lbs and would sit in the sink and clean all the dishes.
That raccoon has more work experience then me now.
Who else had a mini heart attack when the raccoon was inspecting the hand saw?
Dad: We’re not getting a raccoon….
No. No! Don't let the cute in! The world is cruel, life is short, brutish, and nothing matters! If I lose sight of that, I'll want to quit my job for things people tell me matter more than work!
Omg I fucking ADORE this
Seeing that caption after knowing what Reddit can contain made me very scared before I saw the subreddit
Squirrel and raccoon I always wanted one, well to rescue one. I know they are animals and should be in the wild but sometimes they don’t want to leave and choose to stay.
Don't keep wild animals as pets.
The best part of this, is he treats it like a friend.
Hot Dad. I would chase him too.
this video immediately made me a better person
I spent this whole video trying to figure out what job this guy has where he's doing literally every type of handiwork imaginable.
SMH misleading title, thought I was in for a treat
This. Made. My. Day. 
Probably the only compilation clip where I’ve liked the added music.
Thieving lvl?
Trash pandas are the CUTEST!
![gif](giphy|Woc5F2s89MnLO)

I lost my little boy (cat) last night and I just can't deal today.

This is absolutely precious.
That’s it!  My future boyfriend will get this video every time he has a bad day! 

I’ve already watched it 10 times 🥺
This really is an awww
Damn this dude is very handy
Don't keep wild animals as pets and don't take animals to work on a construction site.
That's the most adorable thing I've seen all week!

Thanks, I needed this.
Try no to smile at that internet.
Dad is just like... "Okay, well, I guess we're friends now".
Oh, how absolutely adorable.
This man is a hard worker
More!
I’m a simple man. If I make the sound in the subreddit title, I upvote.
is that a trash panda
This is very Bob Ross of you, and you are appreciated.
Im taking a wide guess the key is to get the racoon when they're a newborn and imprint as a newborn.  Getting anything else will fail.
Dammit, I want my own trash panda now.
And thought Pomeranians were clingy, annoying jerks 🤣
Rocket Raccoon origin
can we get a pet dad?
No.
gets pet anyway.
dad and pet a few weeks later
very cool 😎
Come on Dad, look at these hands of mine; I can do work too!
My heart….this is so sweet! I want a possum now. So sad there are no possums in London :(
Lol
Dad: doesn’t want a dog
dad and the dog:
How did this guy become mates with a raccoon?
That guy is skilled af
He put a collar on it 🥺
Awwwww
"nothing's gonna stop us now" right when he gets stuck behind the wall
The video is wholesome but the title is kind of sus.
I got two
You can unterstand that title very wrong :|
It’s baby Rigby working at the Park.
I too, would love an emotional support racoon
Cutest trash panda
Hard working dad and his companion! Wishing both of you a lifetime of happiness.
I know they get a really bad rap for the destruction they cause to houses and just being troublemakers.

They are also really hilarious. We had some living in the abandoned house next door and I always left fruit out for them. (Life is hard, animals struggle too.) I loved watching them eat and harass each other.
Do raccoons makes good pets?
This is Tom Nook's origin story innit
Construction panda.
He is a disney princess
How many jobs does this guy have?
Is this all one day?!

Man _get's shit done_!
Needs a hip pouch or Fanny pack
This just made my day! So cute!
Man that’s cute
Rocket backstory
Rockets backstory is *adorable *.
Nobody: Dad and the dog
“Nothing can stop us now”

Except a concrete wall lol
Going to need to change that company logo to a raccoon.
That raccoon needs some serious tiny helm
This is not a dude. This is a man.
This is really sweet
Thats the cutest little thing
Ok yeah, we’re going to need a movie or reality show of this
Dads: I don't want a racoon! We don't need one!

Dads with a racoon.......
I loves him!
Trash panda are cute! 

CUUUUUTE!!!!
Rocket Racoon origin story.
He has a collar. This is why I come Reddit.
this so heartwarming
I’m gonna go watch Mannequin now and have a grown man cry.  It’s ok, these are thug tears
Fuck  I want a raccoon.
No one else going to point out how fucking cute that was when he was in the ladder and reached to help 😭😭😭😭
Is that a pet raccoon? Don't raccoons have rabies?
Cute lil r/TrashPandas
Awww that would be so awesome to have that little guy following me around! I would love it!
“Rascal” by sterling north. Highly recommend
cute when they're little...assholes when grown...even to those who raised them
Ok first of all, where can I find a man that useful?
I don't say it much, thank you Reddit.
I’m worried about a “ring of bright water” moment
Oh...oh my heart...
I should get a pet raccoon or tiny piglet.
Raccoons are the best, so cute
I wanna be like this dude when i grow up
I’ll hire that dude if he promises to bring that little critter with him.
Oh to be a small raccoon in a construction site
I needed this this morning, thank you!
Friendo!!!
DID HE GET OVER THE WALL
Still a fantastic song.
Would love the back story
I love this! But that dude works too hard.
It feels like that raccoons purpose is to follow that dude around.
It’s all cute until the raccoon goes through puberty
That's what she said
I feel like I've seen that title somewhere else...
How does nobody mention this lil dude/dudette almost getting crushed by a brick at :47
What men dreams are made of. So lucky
Thats a hardworker!!
I want the forbidden cat!!!!!
So cute awwww awww ooooooo
I thought he was gonna step on the baby
If anyone knows of the person who has Juniper the fox, she recently rescued a baby raccoon. She can confirm that they are *very* clingy.
"helping"
They should name that thing "underfoot"
I’m jealous
This is absolutely adorable
this guy fucks
Neat. Thanks.
Irl Disney Princess
God I fucking needed this today
This is kinda creepy. I don’t take my dog to work.
This raccoon just made my whole week
Quite possibly the greatest montage I've ever seen! 😍
Always saw them as pests. This little guy melted my heart.
and that's my free award!
This is adorable and this man can fix everything it seems.
What an adorable little nuisance.
Thanks to the safety on the saw. No racoon could be hurt. Lovely animals. I wonder if badgers in the UK are bit like US racoons.
Next stop: Santa’s workshop
I like the trash panda, but damn, this guy gets shit done.  I’m more impressed by him.  Hell of worker.
Best buds
I would like a raccoon sidekick, how can I make this happen?
I need pt 2
I too would like to be a Disney princess
That's it that's my dream right there.
This man works.
I’ve never been more jealous in my life
Don't let your pets operate power saws, folks.
That raccoon actually thinks that guy is its mom…
u/forrenxes hopefully someday
If that's the "son", then is it implied that the "dad" had sex with a female racoon or what?
This guy is all that is man.
He looks like an awesome dad, wish I had one
That's it, I need a trash panda!
could of been one of those clips ending too soon by stopping the video when he almost got crushed by the cinder block!
Ngl that's one cute fucking racoon
7 years ago raccoons turned illegal to have as pets here 🤦🏻‍♂️WHY?!
more impressed with this dude than racoon
I’ve legit wanted a raccoon pet all my life. This motivates me
Honestly, same
"I'll get that circular saw."
Does he have a collar on?? He’s claimed. So cute.
I love this so much.
Okay so can someone please tell me the downside to keeping a raccoon as a pet? Terrible smell? Crazy energetic? Potentially hostile? Because all I'm seeing is adorable.
I bet that raccoon is growing up to be unstoppable. No bin is safe with a raccoon and a drill
All I can picture is Krato's voice saying "BOI" every time the camera cuts to a new area. Lmao.
Until this very moment I did not realize how much I need a raccoon in my life
That raccoon needs a hard hat
Almost got stepped on and crushed buy a cinderblock
One man’s trash panda is another man’s best friend.
Time to rewatch Clarkson’s Farm
The cinder block boop
This guy's job looks awesome.  Plus he has a racoon.  My guidance counselor is an asshole
Apprentice tradesman right there
That is adorable.
This guy sure is busy.
How cute

Oh my goodness. I never knew you can tame raccoons like that
Thats a weird cat
If anyone has advise on how to convince my wife that we need a pet raccoon, I’m all ears.
This guy WORKS.
‘Get away from me, you COON!’
Coming from a country without Raccoons, how healthy to humans is having one around? Are they disease/parasite carriers?
“ITS SO FLUFFY IM GONNA DIE”
There’s something about adopting animals that just feels good
Background music check out
soooo cute
What the song name?

Still waiting for the mannequin
Freakin awesome!
Dad: we don’t need a raccoon

Dad and the raccoon:
As someone who grew up in the country with a pet raccoon its all fun and cute until they grow up and there wild side comes out.
Cutest montage ever.
Is there a longer version anywhere?
damn, that thing is cute as a button
Can you have a raccoon as a pet? I thought they had a ton of diseases
come on raccoon child we rolling out
I want a raccoon to love me like that!
I had a raccoon as a pet. His name was coony (i was like 3 years old so give me a break lol) and he was with us for a year or two but then he started getting aggressive towards us so we took him to a animal sanctuary
I love how in the series he gets his own collar! And is that a beautiful cat sibling?
it's "Follow Daddy to Work-Day!" (:
I need to see more of this.
😍😍😍 I can't 😍😍😍 this is too cute

How old is he?
I get the feeling that raccoon has a college fund set up.
How do u get a racoon as a pet?
I want to see them when the little guy is a little more grown up
im crying rn omgggggg 😭😭😭
The audio loop that was cut is perfection.
When s/he climbs up the ladder like “hey let me get the end of your tape for you” I almost died.
Dude I love this!!!!!!!!!
Wait aren’t raccoons nocturnal?  How did he pull this one off?
Did not expect to cry on Reddit today.
Not gonna lie I thought he was going to accidentally tread on it more than once. Little guy gets under his feet more than my cat!
Trash panda super cute
I LOVE HIM
I am sad because it feels like the real parents are dead under a tractor
What kind of dog is this?
That’s my husband! Awesome to see our video on here 😍

Honestly a good raccoon apprentice is so hard to find these days, he got lucky.
Peep my recent post find out the secret message from the simpsons!!!!!!!.....pass it around sand share it
Aww
So I’m in the Yondo and Rocket are earthlings timeline. Ok.
Raccoons seem like they could be fun pets. Anyone know why it isn’t more common?
I need a pet racoon
I had no idea that I needed a baby raccoon.
Fuckin love it
He really loves dad. He's such a great helper
Lovely
This guy seems so prolific. If someone made a montage like that about my life there'd hardly be any location changes... or any movement at all. Plus no raccoon.
That’s what she said
It's amazing how changing one letter would make this an extremely inappropriate sentence
I’m gonna’ fucking cry. Stop doing this to me.
Rocket Raccoon's Origin Movie
That is just adorable
The little collar they got makes this even more adorable.
Definitely improved my day. Thanks for sharing. 🖤🦝
This is fantastic!
And now I want one
Music from the soundtrack of Manacoon. What a classic.
My day is complete
This is the cutest origin story for Rocket Racoon
It's cute, but seeing young wild animals imprint on humans always makes me sad.
I love the buddy raccoon. But where is his PPE?
Thanks I needed this ❤❤❤
Damn that coon works more then most Americans!
I don’t know why I love this so much. But…I love this soooo much
These early dailies from the new Rocket Racoon origin movie look good!
that poor fucker is gonna get lifted by an eagle during the day.
That door he was installing didn't have the correct jamb size
Trash panda!
The coon!
I hope there’s a pt 2 coming out in the future
Holy crap... I'm not sure what it is but I know my heart loves it.
Anyone else notice the amount of times the raccoon nearly got injured
He is helping!! 🥺
Great little guy.
I was hoping this was a follow up to the garage racoon and was the same op but sadly it is not.
Damn, that man has a lot of useful practical skills. Man goals right there.
Damn that is pretty cute.
I need an @ this is too cute
so those planter boxes were nice. what kind of wood did you use.
“Dale, no power tools!”
This is the cutest freaking thing
I watched this raccoon risk injury several times in this video.
"nothings going to stop us" right as the racoon gets stopped by a wall.
I can’t even lie. That’s some adorable shit right there
What a bond. I would like to know what he named it.
Super cute little buddy!
Why is the tree service guy welding and putting up doors lol
Awww. Now I want a little trash panda pet.
Now i want a baby raccoon
Anyone else nervous he was going to crush it? There were several near misses.
Little thing almost died about 2-3 times 😂. Table saw, cement block.
Oh my gawd. I WOULD QUIT MY JOB FOR ONE OF THESE. 
Maan I love those racoons…
Man i want a racoon son
I am so envious. Someday I’ll have my own trash panda shadow ❤️
Cute little coonie.
This is adorable!
This guy does everything!
This dude looks like he’s building that building all by himself.
Is there anything that guy cant do?
I guess I have a raccoon now
that's MAD cute 😩
Dad: "I don't want a damn cat!"

Two days later...
I was having a crappy week but this video brought a smile out of me.
Can’t the racoon fuck him up if he bites him or scratches? Rabies type shit?
“Rocky Raccoon checked into his room, only to find Gideon’s bible.”
He’s the first ever raccoon to complete trade school. We’ve been watching his apprenticeship this entire time
That’s what she said.
That’s one hardworking busy guy - but he always has time for his little buddy.
This is the best this I saw today...
Wait is that a raccoon?
They’re going to take over, their dads company someday.
Imagine going to the foreman and being like “Yo, theres a raccoon following Dan around”.

“You mean Lil’ Steve? Yeah he’s Daves buddy.”

“Is this safe?”

“I mean the raccoon follows Dan and it keeps Dan motivated. You wanna piss of the man with a pet raccoon?! I dont.”

“-but”

“Lil’ Steve has potential. He’s young, works hard and is always on time. He’s a little immature but he doesn’t show up drunk, usually”.
And this was the origin of Rocket Raccoon
Boy if I had a dollar for every time I've said that.
The cinderblock almost got him. I just about cried out and scared everyone near me. Phew.
What a sweet dog
Keeping wold animals as pets is just wrong, no matter how awww they are.
You can’t stop love.
So that's where Tom Nook learned all this stuff
That's what she said.
Doggie
That’s one hard working guy. Jeez.
Too cool
He almost got cinder blocked!
I'd pay for the hours that raccoon is on the job if I got to pet it.
It’s the collar for me 😂
Yo, I have a complaint. Why is the end scratching so short??
This was so fucking cute
Ok but dude here can do everything
I would watch this video for the whole lifetime of the racoon.
They need their own movie
Fuck off. This is so cute
This might be the cutest thing I’ve seen in awhile.
