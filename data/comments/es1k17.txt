Pokemon Go? More like Pokemon Go to gate 24 there's a Giratina raid starting in two minutes, step on it Harold
Pokemon Go is so oddly cross-generational. I've played off-and-on since launch and am always impressed by the variety of people I see showing  up at raids and community days. Lots of older folks and mixed-age families. Very cute.

Maybe I could get my grandma into it. She's got a bunch of stops in her area.
We chatted in the APM and I got permission. All good.
I downloaded PoGo the first day it came out. I was never into Pokemon, but it sounded like an interesting new idea. After twenty minutes, I uninstalled it. "Meh."

A few days later, my wife had downloaded it, and had already caught a considerable amount of pokemon. So I reinstalled. I'm more casual than she is, but she really enjoys collecting (and collecting pokemon doesn't collect dust like collecting tchotchkes!), so I hope to be that gentleman someday.
I hated this game on launch and deleted a couple of days after. Last year I met a girl and she had been playing it for ages, showed me pokemon she got all around the world and how there was more about than what there was. 2 months after that we started a tradition of always making sure we are free on community days and we make them dates, we then hunt for shinies and first one to get one has to buy lunch. It’s stupid possibly but it’s a tradition now. So this will probably be us down the line
My mom and aunt play together. My aunt makes my mom drive (safer that way too, she wont hesitate to play while driving) and instead of cute cheering it's more like "ooh there's one! Ah you passed it bitch turn around!!"
I just got a hip replacement 7 months ago and on Sundays my husband and I go to the local Gardens here in Cali and when I can't walk anymore, he pushes me in the wheelchair while I pokemon. I'm only 41, get yourself a POKEMAN!
Orlando airport?
Everyone says "Find someone who treats you like this..." 

How about, become someone who treats their loved ones like this?
Me to my boyfriend: “aww you better push me around the airport!!” 

My boyfriend: “Nooo, I push you down the stairs” 

We love each other I swear 😂
Find someone who loves you like this 

Be someone who deserves to be loved like this
Over the Winter Break, I organized a sleepover for my 10 year old son and a few of his friends. I drove them around in our SUV, let them use my phone’s hotspot, and we spent several hours looking for raids and gyms in our neighborhood. About an hour into it, I stopped for pizza and they all thought it was hilarious that I served it up right there in the car so we could keep hunting. 

A fun time was had by all.
❤️ this
When the game was at it's most popular a couple of friends of mine gave their phones to a kid that belonged to two other friends of ours. He wasted all the Pokeballs catching a bunch of Pidgey. Well later that year the kid was diagnosed with cancer and a couple years later passed away. One of my friends took one of the pokemon he caught and leveled him up in order to claim a gym in their town. Idk if that gym is still owned by that pokemon but it makes me happy knowing someone did that on his behalf. A lot of people are still really affected by his passing as he made a lot of friends in his last couple of years and even had a song dedicated for him by a local band.
Showed this to my husband, he said he's not going to do that... So, like, should I just file for divorce now or?
Level 37 checking in. I’ve been playing it a long time and refuse to put money into it. 

We’re moving and our new house is a Pokestop.
MY HEART 💚🥺🥰
Last winter I was really sick on community day (once a month a different Pokémon is featured for a few hours, and they show up all over the place. There are special shiny versions you can find, and special moves). My husband bundled me up and drove me around town so I could play from the heated car! He even stopped at different locations around the waterfront so I could also do some duck watching at the same time (one of my winter hobbies). Usually we walk around for three hours, catching Pokémon together. I caught for both of us while he was my chauffeur. It was a really nice gesture!
My dad would do the same for my mother. He would walk with her to the park or around our block just so she could get the poke stops and catch all the Pokemon. 

I think on his old phone he still has her game, he's gone and caught a few in memory of her but it's not the same without her.
Awww so sweet love how shes heading towards another wheelchair user who looks like their playing too lol "Boss battle" ..
"little lady"? She's a goddamb pokemon master thank you very much
A few years ago I had an accident, and couldn't walk well for a while. Like, hardly at all at first. My partner and I have a long-standing tradition of going to the zoo allllll the time. We just love it. We have an awesome local zoo, and we were members, and took advantage of it plenty.  When Pokemon Go came out, we found that it was an amazing place to play. It was a ton of fun to do together. 

After the accident, even once I cooooould sort of walk, the zoo was still way too much for me to handle, especially while trying to look at anything. We both just kind of avoided bringing it up at all. We never said, "Oh, I guess we can't do the zoo anymore." We just never talked about it.

One day, he said, "Hey did you know you can rent a wheelchair at the zoo? It doesn't cost much." 

"But you'd have to push me," I protested. "All over the place. And I like to watch the bears from the perch. That slope is steep." 

He insisted, and I gave in. (The disability made a huge impact on my ability to accept help from people.) I figured we'd do it once, and he'd never offer again.

But for two years, we kept going to the zoo constantly, him pushing me around all damn day. He's the best.
I thought I was a sociopath and then I saw this post😍
When I was first going through some really rough chemo I fell and broke my leg. One day my husband and stepdaughter and I went to the local mall. My husband was pushing me around and he needed to use the restroom. He was concerned about leaving me, and asked his daughter to “watch me” while he was gone. I teased him about it later but really, his concern was so sweet!
My husband and I play and we're in our 50's. He just had the flu and was home from work for a week. I took his phone out every day as I went out to get Poke Stops while he slept. We've been playing since day 1.

We've been married 35 years.

I can see us doing this one day.
Yoo holy shit! I know these people and they are crazy nice; I was a bagger at an Albertsons and they always make the classic jokes and treats everyone really kindly! People will notice that niceness and positivity anywhere when it's genuine, cool to see this pop up on Reddit :^)
I swear there are only 2 types of old people. Sweet cheery ones like this and grumpy ones that complain all the time
i have arthritis and can't game like i'd like to.  it hurts too much. my husband plays the game for me and i watch. i have no doubt he'd push me around fo PoGo.
I never played it myself though I did play a little bit of ingress (game that pogo is based on by same company). But my wife got stuck into it, one day she screams "pull over!" five minutes later we're in a church parking lot with 30+ other people cause some special event was on. Great fun to watch.

Uh. Not sure where I was going with that story but there it is!
This is effing awesome. I hope I find someone to let me be goofy in public because she's also goofy in public lol
I've been a massive fan of  pokemon since I was a kid, and I've played pokemon go on and off since it came out and my parents always made fun of me when I played it in front of them, but when my Mom downloaded it August she became addicted immediately addicted and played every chance she could get, she would always call me from home asking questions about pokemon that she caught, she made it to level 31 in two months.
Legit did this with my gf when she tore her Achilles last month !! ... In Vegas 😅
My husband likes to play especially when we’re traveling. We convinced all 10 of my husband’s cousins to join us and pay the fee to get on the submarine by Pearl Harbor to get a chance of getting a shiny Rayquaza. Only my husband got a shiny. Everyone else was pretty bummed. Good memories though.
I have someone who loves me like that, and I love him back the same way. Together 32 years, married 26 years. Met at 18. 😊
Pokemon Go? More like Pokemon GOALS 🥰👌🏻I’m looking forward to find a love like this.
So funny I can spot that this is MCO based off nothing but the shitty carpet. That's absolutely adorable though, haha :D
... and find someone you want to love like this ❤️
I thought this was r/pics for a second
I love this, it’s so wholesome. Brought a smile to my face!
I’m still faithfully playing POGO and my husband dutifully feigns excitement when I tell him about all of my new Pokémon. He’d definitely push me around the airport to catch Pokémon (but definitely make fun of me the whole time LOL). This pic just warms my heart.
I had to come on here to say how very much this made me smile!  I needed this today.
My partner doesnt play but he always asks if i caught anything and let me nerd out on him even if he doesn’t understand.
This is all I will accept. I don't mind aging and slowing down, I do mind getting "old".
my gf doesn't love me but she would 100% do this cuz she's fun.
I love how so many people from so many age groups play this game.  I play and brought my teenager around to play and we would see folks from all ages.
Wish i could... But my particular brand of autism really prevents people from understanding, and in turn, loving me. Which is fine. I got my dog.
I thought I was a sociopath and then I saw this post😍
I hope someone dropped a lure for her somewhere in the terminal
There is an elderly couple that plays where I live. They’re probably in their late 70s. They are forever knocking me out of gyms. It’s adorable.
I’m crying some grown ass man tears.
I always feel weird about posts like this like OP you’re taking a picture of strangers and posting it? I wouldn’t want someone to do that of me no matter if it’s wholesome or not.
I’m pretty sure I’ve been in that store on the right. Looks like Orlando airport.
My husband would walk with me and wait for me to collect poke balls and get all the Pokémon in the evenings.
He already got the catch of his life
Lol there's another woman in a wheelchair across the way doing the same thing I bet.
wonder what sort of Pokemon inhabit airports?
I reinstallled Pokemon Go a good while back after my friend encouraged me to. I've been really into it since. One time while on a walk I suggested that my dad could download it too and play Pokemon Go with me, he reluctantly agreed.

He's been absolutely obsessed with it since, even more than me. He walks 50km with it almost every week as far as I'm aware.

I got my partner playing it a lot too. She's a part timw wheelchair user and one time when I was pushing her along I gave her my phome so she could catch them for me. She really enjoyed it, I got her playing for a good few months but she's having a bit of a break now.

Pokemon Go is great.
“I wanna be the very best
That no one ever was
dun duuun dun dun”
He looks busy. Must have found a few. Are airports popular in pogo?
Wait, we are all not on the same page when it comes to what Pokemon Go actually is.. You know what. That is an amazing thing he was doing for his wife none the less.
I’m pretty sure I’ve been in that store on the right. Looks like Orlando airport.
That's pretty fucking awesome.
If my man doesn’t do this, I don’t want him
This is the sweetest thing ever 😊
i have arthritis and can't game like i'd like to.  it hurts too much. my husband plays the game for me and i watch. i have no doubt he'd push me around fo PoGo.
I used to do this for patients at the hospital I work at if they were bed-bound. There were a bunch of Poke-Stops on the hospital grounds. It was fun. :)
Find someone? Brother, i’m finding that one shiny that fled last year.
Aww, my heart. I wish I could find someone who would do this for me. I've been taking care of other people (and sick animals too) for so long, it would be nice to be the one being taken care of - be someone's priority, for a change. Oh well.
wholesome level 100
>Find someone who loves you like this.

And who's willing to KO the weirdos taking unsolicited photos of you in public.
Grow tf up and stop taking pictures of disabled people for karma
Please stop "awwing" at older people. It's so incredibly condescending.
And her grandkids probably got her into the game
I recognize that carpet! MCO!
Well. That's the most wholesome thing that I will see all week
I could tell this was MCO by the carpet, then the Mickey shirt reinforced it
looks like he boutta visit his grandson in japan
Orlando Airport confirmed
Nothing more wholesome than meeting a stranger 40 years your senior (I'm 33) because you both showed up to a raid in your small town.  POGO has its upsides for sure.
That is so sweet.  I wonder if they play with their grand children and are trying to catch some for them.
And here I am happy my partner starting playing again once we started dating since I still did, but salty he somehow is now a level above me 😂
My husband and kids play this, so I have to drive thru our hospital parking lot everytime we pass it, slow down by the sprint store, park at the city courthouse block so they can walk around there.
Relationship goals.
In today's world this difficult, nobody has time, it's all about fast life.
I think only my dog loves me like that
Oof right in the feels.

Relationship goals.

Any other typical phrases that convey how cute this is.
What a champ, also love seeing older generations  playing video games. Stimulates the mind.
I bet she only opens one gift from the same friend per day and whites to open the other gift that that same friend sends them till the next day. So both of their friendship levels increase.
He's got a pimp ass hat too
My family and I all play it. It’s great when it’s a super nice day outside; we’ll seriously walk downtown for hours. Stop at a couple shops and get lunch then run to the raids that are popping up.
Sweet 'ol Folks :)
Got one!  We go on poke dates to catch them and get giggly when we level them up.  Both of us are over 40.
Me and my husband in 50 years
Her battery will die before she takes off
Awww! My best friend had never heard of Pokemon before PoGo but I told him to download it as a way to get out moving with me. Now he plays even more than I do.
This is relationship goals
This is real life goals!
when i get a boyfriend and we travel together, i'm gonna hold his hand and we're gonna play pokemon go together at the airport until the plane arrives.
Hope you guys traded friend codes!
r/mademesmile
I tried it during the initial launch.  It was fun.  Played with my son.  Time moved on.  Wife tried it and now we all play.  Walks on Sunday or community events.  And when she travels we are always excited to see what pokestop gifts she sends us.  

Decent game.
Are ya winning?
Well, looks like Jack and Jill went fetching Pokemon creatures after all
Pokemon go saved my parents marriage. I'm a fan.
I'm yet to try Pokémon Go despite being a fan of the mainline games. It's incredibly heartwarming to see something like this.
"Are ya winning?"
My guess is he did not suggest she get her wedding dress from Wish
It's enough to make a teenager cry.  (≧▽≦)
r/pokemongo
This is making me teary eyed bec I feel like I'm such an asshole to my SO when I don't try to enjoy the things she enjoy.
Orlando airport?
This is my future. As is I drive around town at 15 mph (when appropriate) so my wife can catch Pokémon whenever we are out.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gamer move
Everyone lose they minds if it was a big ole girl on a scooter
As a Gen Z, i would be Damn proud and have a tears of Joy seeing this graceful couples do play and being actively happy.
Airports are the best place to play Pokémon go
MCO?
For every few moments like this, there are moments of disagreement.

Set realistic relationship goals, people.
> Find someone who loves you like this.

So die alone?
Looks like MCO!
I'd bed my next paycheck these people thought Pokemon was fucking stupid 20 years ago.
My mans got a nice hat. I dig it.
I literally did. My wife’s in a wheelchair and we play Pokémon Go all the time. Except we’re in our 30’s
This is literally me and my fiancé and we are in our twenties, he doesn’t care about Pokémon go but I still play it, and he wheels me through the airport to get the pokestops
Professor oak enjoying retirement
*Everyone liked that*
u/IndiLou11
I told my wife I'd push her around to catch Pokemon, she came back with "Yeah, right off a cliff".

She knows me so well <3
Maybe he really loves Pokemon and she's just his aide?
This makes me miss my grandparents something fierce. They lived close by a natural lake and would always head there on Friday evening to sit on a beachfront bench and just chat and skip rocks until the sun set. After my grandma passed, my grandpa would go by himself if nobody else would go with, sit on their bench and talk to my grandma about his week and catch up with her. I always went with him when I could, but didn’t know he would speak with her until he started declining and asked me to go tell grandma what was going on. That’s some soulmate life right there.
Aww my husband acts all exasperated when I ask him to stop at a pokestop or go somewhere else for a new pokemon and when I've caught one he wants to see it and says something along the lines of "piplup huh... cute little bugger" and then remembers he's  a manly mechanic type and grumbles. I love it. :)
Need me a freak like this
I like it anytime I see old people playing video games.

For me, the saddest thing about old age is when you see the lack of interest in their eyes, video games are like pets, they perk them up.  Even simple games are working your brain.  the husband is also working his ass a little bit walking.  I see people like this, I think they deserve each other. 

Anyway, this is very wholesome. I dig it.
I think what is most heartwrenching is that his lady probably has a ton more pokemon than me 😭 I need a pokemon go chauffeur.
Why do I feel this is just a random picture of some lady on a phone with a grampa pushing her, and then this title is pasted ontop of it?
My husband would walk with me and wait for me to collect poke balls and get all the Pokémon in the evenings.
I took my fiance to an amusement park recently. She cannot walk that much since she got injured so I've been pushing her around in a wheelchair if we go outside. 

I thought it might not be much fun seeing that I don't really care for rides. But universal studios has some really cool attractions if you're not into big fast rides (like 6 flags). The guest relations people were really cool and gave us what is basically a "fast pass". Which is good because I hate standing in line. 

We probably got to do more that day because we didn't spend more than 30 minutes of the entire day waiting in line. Some people spend that just waiting to buy a ticket at certain times and days! 

She had the time of her life and it really made her so happy. Which makes me happy.
My eyes are leaking

100% introduced by a grandkid and plays so they can trade and send gifts
I’m in a wheelchair and me and my sister often do this lol we go out on walks and she’ll push me around to catch Pokemon
I regularly have to drive slowly through neighborhoods so my wife can play Wizards Unite
Looks like they are getting ready to face the opposing trainer w/ the pink shirt

Spending all her time catching those poke bugs. 

Will never get a job at walmart.
I wish I could "love" this 🥰
Airports are so amazingly boring. Good on them for finding a way to entertain themselves while waiting.
Pokemon You Go
This makes me so happy.
She catches Pokemon in her free time and he looks like he fights Dr. Doofenschmirtz
Is this a jojo reference?
So cute! Love is... 😊
Aww 😍
Love this!
That’s so cute I love this!
My mother would be downright confused by Pokemon. On top of that, she has a hard time walking (bad knees and back from a car accident) but wants to lose weight that she's had for likely over 21 years.

I'm overweight as well and I played Pokemon Go walking down the road to my volunteer place every week. Maybe I'll introduce her to it!
Awwwwwwww
This is so wonderful.
Pokemon Go is such a good game to socialize people with
that is really sweet
This is adorable
Damn, my heart
My heartstrings..
Games are so beautiful because they let people dream.
I did
That will so be Ambar n I in like 30 or 4 0 years!!  You never know who that person is in your life, but everyone has someone like that for them and my only hope is everyone find that person ment for them and not just settle because your afraid to be alone.
Don't forget to pokemon go to the polls
Omg do cuteeeee
Лол
Man I hope one day I have a husband like that when I'm old.
I won't hold my breath though considering I'm a straight male. :(
romance ISNT dead 

i want what they have 🥺🤧
This is true love!
Pokémon go to the polls 

Silence
I didnt know this game was still around...
Let me save us both some time: I am here and ready to be loved like this
They are the definition of infinite true love...
This deserves ALL the upvotes
My wife would wheel me to the stairs and tip me over
Her leopard luggage 🤩
Adorable 😭
Older people love Pokemon Go! Got back into it last May and was completely shocked going to raids seeing the majority of players to be 60+ in age. They always help on discord too, it’s awesome.
my pokemons are one of the most important things in my simple life,but i would legit give any pokemon i had to this lady
Ahh true love does exist! So cute!
Goals

The dream.

Shit... i thought i did. Now I'm here with two kids and a wife that doesn't love me.
Beautiful!
Phoenix? Orlando?
That makes me sad lol
Orlando?
38 and haven’t found anyone yet... 

This certainly makes me happy thinking people can be like this, but also very hard knowing everyone around me has that certain someone on their team. At some point probably need to accept Im on my own and won’t have kids, sounds harsh but some just don’t get to have this.
I hope this woman catches em all
I have some one who loves me like this and let me tell you it is bliss, I hope everyone finds their true partners. ❤️
Gotta catch em all

That’s Orlando international. I  recognize that carpet anywhere
First I have to find someone who loves me

This is Orlando, I’d know that carpet anywhere.
That is so fucking cute.
Omg my heart!!! How cute is this!
Is this at the Orlando MCO airport? 

It looks familiar....
My grandma can’t even text.
Is this MKE airport?
Sadly, most of us will probably never find someone to love us this much.
Omg can I skip dating and marriage and all that and just have that now
I've been married 22 years now and just 2 years into our marriage my health tanked.  My husband has stood with me as I went from someone who was working and contributing, to unable to work, doctor appointments, surgery, the whole family having to go gluten free (I have seizures if I get any gluten) which especially sucks, and more.  I know that this could be us in the future (though I hope I'm healthier by then). 

You don't have to like the same things, you just have to like that your spouse has something that makes them happy, and find joy in their enthusiasm.
This is wholesome ❤️
God the Orlando airport is so distinguishing. Why is that carpet engraved in my brain
LIFE GOAL ! Gonna put this in my bucket list

Was this taken before or after she made him a sandwich?
You just gotta catch them all
That grandparent type of nerd love has got to be strong as anything I could imagine.
I'm impressed she even knows what Pokemon are 😂
Don't think I would ever.
She joined the #Mewtwo movement.
Reminds me of my parents
I know that carpet.
Ahhh....this is what I hope life will be like for me with my someone, when I am these people’s age 😌
Nobody loves me, not even a fraction of that
Hey! This is MCO, I recognize our terrible carpet anywhere. Welcome (or thanks for visiting) our city!

At this point I think I'm never finding someone. I do think the couple in this picture are super adorable though for sure.
Wow I miss my grandparents..  this is so precious and pure🥺🖤

I've noticed more older people playing pokemon go than younger.
Fuckin sweet hat too
Florida. Tampa?
Hubs got me into Pokemon Go as a way to get more ready for walking the hills of San Fran when we took our vacation there over the summer. Didn't work but we found something to really bond over and we often take the "poke-path" home when he picks me up from work so we can spin and catch. I mean, just one more facet to our nerdy marriage...
Dude is set a gamer with that og fedora
I thought they banned the game from airports.. as in you can’t find any Pokémon there anymore.
I can't even find somebody to eat lunch with me let alone love me
What an adorable couple!
My mom will just ask me to roll her around like this when she's older
But what if the wheelchair was ment for him...!
I used to drive our car around while my wife and kids played for hours on end was a blast, my wife would okay my account with my phone when she could.
Now that's beautiful right there
Dude this is the dream i have about getting old
Our Baby Boomers Parents, slash, grandparents are  the awesome generations.
relationship goals 😥😥
That’s adorable. I didn’t even know this game was still around or that people were still playing it. It was huge for like 15 minutes, then just seemingly vanished.
My day is made
Welp, it looks like I'm downloading Pokemon Go. I had no idea it could be so much fun. Hubby and I smack-talk about other games so what's one more!?! Thanks all!
I discovered this sub isn't for animals
Looks like Orlando International Airport! Great place to catch Pokémon  :)
I don't know why, but the Pokemon spawns there are amazing in that main lobby area before security
I hope to God she's on Consumer Cellular
real love never dies
Now THAT is true love.
Aww yasss
Everyone like that
Any ladies out there that AREN'T in love with their phones like that? Maybe I should start dating old men...
This is so sweet!!!
I've given up looking :/
This is the type of relationship I wish to have one day!!

Reddit gaming culture finding solidarity with "normal people" or "old people" in pics of them playing games has to be one of the cringier phenomena on this site.

❤️❤️❤️
stupid she needs a go+
Older people who have been married for decades appreciate the sanctity of marriage and will work through any problem rather than quickly divorce like today's couples. Nothing but mad respect for them.
Someone needs to teach her more about Pokémon though - she’s wasting her time on a pidgey.....
Yea, only true love is catching pokemon on airport with your disabled wife. I wish i were them.

This looks like my airport 🧐🤨

I am disgusted by this post and by you for posting it. Following people around any public space taking pictures (aka stalking) is weird and disgusting.

Even just one picture would be weird, but that you've been following them, listening to their conversations and watching her actions on her phone? I think that's criminal.

Stop it and leave them alone.
I'd bet this is PDX
I sure hope she puts out once they get to where they are going.
An old lady is gaming more than me ?

Oof
Hm
I thought I did but I she dumped me.
That her 3 husband. Not first.
Except I don’t like games like Pokémon Go. What’s the equivalent for people who like Pokémon but despise the abortion that is that “online game”?
Not everybody gets somebody like that
No one loves me at all
stupid bitch
