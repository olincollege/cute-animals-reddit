I love how happy and relaxed mama dog is üò≠ she‚Äôs so happy her babies are safe. You are wonderful for taking them in!
Holy shit that's a lot of dogs
Momma looks so happy to be somewhere safe and that she can finally stop worrying about her babies!
I dunno if it's confirmation bias, but I feel like rescued dogs are mostly so grateful to be rescued.  Like they know.  My dog was rescued and had a rough life before, and it always seems like she is so grateful to have a happy comfy life now.  Best dog I ever owned.
All of them are adopted and very happy now!This is not me recording, it is my friend, we do volunteer work on the same NGO and we rescued Cl√©o (the mom).

The babies as they were posted for adoption,

Edit 1: She is an american bully and was kept in extremely bad conditions by a company that sells dogs. She was abandoned PROBABLY (we don't know for sure) after getting pregnant by a street dog on accident. Since non pure dogs don't sell, they abandoned her.
that backyard tho... i got a notification from my bank that i was too broke to look at it.. ffs
You are a really nice person, world needs more like you.
My family's lab had a litter of 10 one summer when I was a kid. We had a fenced in backyard with lots of landscaping and the same thing would happen! You could look outside and see none of them, but as soon as you open the door they came out of the woodwork and flooded the yard! They would sleep in the bushes to stay in the shade
I wonder how much pain she did endure.
Best of luck to you & this family.
I may not understand the language, but I can understand and feel the happiness and joy
What a cute momma!
9 puppies wow
You are a good lady.
Cachorros lindos! T√£o fofos e gordinhos!
They keep on coming and they keep on coming and they keep on coming and they....
Momma looks so fucking happy. üò≠üò≠üò≠
My aunt and uncle (God rest his soul) retired to Ecuador a few years ago. One night their alarm was tripped, and while no break-in occurred that night, they were worried somebody was casing their house. The next morning, they spoke to the gardener (great man, helped my uncle out of bed and into his wheelchair every morning after he lost the use of his legs) and his advice was "take in a street dog."

They did, and have had zero problems since. She watches the house and keeps anyone not welcomed in by my aunt out, and in return she gets a roof over her head, a full belly, and endless love and affection.
What language is she speaking? Sounds like the Sims tbh

Legal ver brasileiros aqui! :)
As cute as those babies are..I let out an audible "aww-haha-awww" when i saw the momma junping up and looking at you SO lovingly with all that extra happiness to boot
I was gonna platinum this but I thought about it and if you have PayPal or something I'd rather give you the money directly to help raise the dogs. You're an awesome person and I'd like to help you be the gem that you are, not give reddit money you could use towards such a kind and generous thing.
Thank you for making sure all the puppers are all okay and happy
r/ItHadToBeBrazil
I *literally* went 'aaaaaa!' and put my hands to my mouth like some stereotype overwhelmed by cuteness.

When those little nuggets jumped out of hiding and came wobbling towards you. Damn, that must be the best feeling ever. You did good.
Who's cutting onions
You are an incredible person
I have read all of your messages and I am touched! Thank you all so much for the kind words! I have been working with stray dogs for almost 2 years now and it is awesome! They are always extremely grateful and kind. I really encourage everyone to help even with small acts like sharing and liking shelters/NGOs social medias.
Are you Ace Ventura?
There‚Äôs a special place in heaven for people like you...

No, above that one.
N-no, above that one too.
You‚Äôre honestly such an amazing person, not everyone would do this, so thankyou so much for doing this for her and the puppies üíú
Thank.you
OMG, they are so cute! The mommas face is so happy. You're wonderful for rescuing them. Thank you.
Aweee! That happened to me. Brought home a rescue dog. Was gonna let her settle then take her in for spaying. Sitting on the couch givin a belly rub and realized she either had gas or a belly of babies lol turned out to be seven of the little buggers. Thankfully found amazing homes for everyone.
You are awesome! Bless you for doing this.
Omggggg
Your backyard is their path to adventure - hide-and-go-seek wonderland!
Primeira postagem nesse sub que t√° em portugu√™s
Awwwww! Look at how much Mama loves you
so... much... poop
We don't deserve dogs
/u/vredditshare
I would like to see more of this back yard/garden!
Since it looks like you help rescue when you can, is there an Amazon list for food somewhere that Reddit folks could help with the next time you save some?
Ugh. I could never have all those puppies and give them away. Even if I could make a small fortune. I just want to be smothered in good boys.
Oh my god! My heart burst with joy when I saw a glimpse of mamma. Thank you for your kindness! Please post more more more videos. Also, please please please make sure babies get spayed and neutered before you send anyone to their new wonderful forever home. Sometimes adopting families say they will but for one reason or another they won‚Äôt. Keeping population under control is one of the ways we can prevent such events like letting a pregnant mamma dog out on the streets. Especially her breed, not everyone knows how wonderful these dogs are, they take them as puppies because they are cute and cuddly then when they grow up they don‚Äôt want them anymore.  If I may, thank you again on behalf of the dog loving pitty loving community! I kiss your hands for this rescue!!!
You can rescue me, my SO, and our animals. That backyard is nice AF.
It's a puppy parade!
Mum is just beautiful
SO. MANY. B A B I E S
That is totally adorable!  That poor dog, to have that many little tiny super sharp teeth chew on her for feeding time, poor thing
You are a good person.
IS THIS WHAT HEAVEN IS LIKE???
I love your garden!
So many babies!! So sweet!
She's got a such a beautiful voice and lovely accent. Also, what a happy momma! That's a large litter of puppies she had!
Aww Bless you!!  What a loving person to rescue her and take care of them all.  - I love your private yard there,  by the way.  It is so lush and beautifully manicured!! Kudos all around!
They looks so pleased with themselves! ‚ÄúMom did you see?! She was like ‚Äòwhere are the puppies?‚Äô And we were like Surprise! And all ran out and she was sooo happy! We are good puppers!‚Äù
Most excellent what you did. Now go the extra mile have her neutured.
We don't deserve dogs
An abandoned pregnant street dog, Gosh, I wonder what it is....

A pitbull you say?!?!? No way!!!!! I never would have guessed.
Let's talk about that yard! Omg I'm jealous
Ha ha! The human is focused on mom! 

AAAAAATAAACK!
üñ§üñ§
So adorable!
So cute <3
Aww good job OP! I wish to rescue a doggie someday too tbh ;c
I'll take your entire stock!
Thank you for rescuing this family. I am sure you will manage to find a home for all these puppies! Just hit FB, Insta etc! People have a heart... sometime they just need a hand to remember where it is
i want your house
OH LORD HE COMMIN
You are a good person...thank you.
How is that street dog?
More of her and her babies, please!!! She reminds me of my old dog. She's so gorgeous!
Aaaaa que amorzinhos <3
What breed is it?
Hereditary behaviour
The love and appreciation in that dog's eyes makes me wanna cry
Nice garden. (the puppies are amazing, just everybody else said that and someone needed to bring up the garden)
I wanna die there
Esse um dos coment√°rios em portugu√™s que vc procura meu/minha amigo/a
Cute how all of the pups know it‚Äôs safe to come out once they see their mom running up with her tail wagging.
Im sorry but that massive crack is driving me insane
QUE LINDOOOOOOO aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Omg that's the cutest thing ever. What a happy mama with all her babies.
I like your patio
I‚Äôm not in Brazil, but I‚Äôm willing to buy a ticket or two for one of those little guys
They LOVE you!!!! Thank you so much for rescuing them all!
You are AWESOME!!!! Thank you for rescuing the Mama and her babes!!!
In a backyard like that, I would enjoy hiding too!
This is like the munchkin guild
What a sweet momma she looks so happy! Your backyard is really cute.
You seem like such a nice person! And your backyard is so beautiful! Thanks for being awesome!!!
I just had to comment to say that you're an absolutely awesome person for saving this Momma and her babies!
‚ÄúAi Cleo, caraio‚Äù s2
What language is this?
You are a saint.
~ wiggle ~
Went from ‚Äòawww‚Äô to ‚ÄòAawwWW SHIT THEY‚ÄôRE EVERYWHERE‚Äô

And look at that sweet smile!
Your yard is beautiful
So many babies!!!!
Is this what heaven looks like?
Omg I love the surprising amount of dogs haha
I love your yard!
Lol soooo many!
She so cuuuuuuute
What a litter!
Moar please.
Aw the momma looks so happy to see her
Awwww, she's so grateful to you... look at those eyes and tail wagging
I command you to hand over these puppies and their mother.
That‚Äôs an incredible back yard
Your blessed for taking her in. If I could I would take every stray in if I ever hit the lotto i would take as much as i could.
Mom likes this human, therefore I too shall like this human.
With that many babies, you'd think it'd be the mom that would be the one to enjoy hiding
Oh my God. They love you!
Oh my god this melted my heart. The momma is soooooo cute. I'm so happy she found a home for her and her babies.
ADORABLE. You also have a beautiful garden.
Finally something good coming from Brazil!! Parab√©ns!
its like hi hooman x20
Street dog?  You realize she is your dog now right?
Wow you have a lovely backyard! So comfy..and that‚Äôs good karma points to give a home to a beautiful group of pups
I can tell they love you :)
"Let ride the hounds of war!"
What acute backyard though!
Beautiful. So much joy!
This ended too soon I need to see more!
*Loooooove...* ***Unlimited loooooove!***
You are my hero.  That is one happy mommy doggie, and a happy pack of liddle puppets.  She will be devoted to you forevermore.  That's a helluva reward, isn't it?
Bless your heart . You madame deserved that hug you got from her . üíû
I congratulate you on a job well done. Filled with love. I know the puppies will need to be spayed and neutered but please wait as long as possible. So much of their body and mind needs to develop before doing so. There is so much wrong with premature spay and neuter. 
Great job filled with love.
Vai brasil caralho, finalmente achei um br no reddit
u/zia1997 dont you dare say this isn't adorable
Don't know who is cuter, the doggies or the lady speaking in the video ü§ó‚ù§üê∂ü•∞
She's so happy and so are the babies! Thank you for rescuing them! They all look so healthy! You've given them such a wonderful chance at life!
you are the best human
I wouldn‚Äôt be able to work, sleep or eat.  Puppy play all day, every day!
Make s me mad how people don't care about animals when you see how amazing they are.
I WANT THEM ALL!  


OP, what are you planning on doing with the puppies once they're old enough to be separated from their mother?
This made me smile so hard. Love Cleo and her babies!!
What language is this? It's fucking beautiful.
I was expecting more puppies.
Omg. That's happiness in a bottle.
Thank goodness people like you exist.  Awesome.
is this heaven
The army of cuteness has arrived!üíïüíïüíïüòç
You are that mama‚Äôs angel. She looks so grateful and happy. You did an amazing thing for that dog and her babies. 

My face is soaking from all the happy tears. I wish I could hug you. I wish I could bring you a load of blankets or towels. Thank you for taking care of the universe. 

Also, that mama is gorgeous and HOW MANY PUPPIES ARE THERE?  I‚Äôm dying here.
is that a Pitbull? imagine keeping all of them, you could never be robbed.
This video has singlehanded you turned my crappy Monday right around. Pure, unbridled, love. Thank you, kind human, for giving this mama and her babies a safe and happy place. The world needs more people like you.
This is really nice...  Joy and happiness
Damn the mom loves her
Dogs are the best thing in this world.
Keep them all forever or I'll find you. Jk on the last part but dead ass serious on the first part..
Momma dog lookin mighty happy.
Thank you for helping! What country/city are you in? Maybe some people here can help with adoption/fostering
Great backyard!!
Time for a 101 pit bulls
She loves you - you are very lucky and very kind.
Thank-you for being a good person.
Cuteness overload
Theres always one that is antisocial af hahaha i want the one on the cage haha üòç
She was a street dog? Wow, shes vey friendly. Then again, pitts are pretty nice dogs
It‚Äôs 2 am and I‚Äôm on day 5 of a really hard insomnia cycle. I was pissed about being awake, but seeing this made me grin so big. You are awesome for rescuing mama and taking care of all 17262628 of those puppies. Your backyard is literal paradise.
and I'm that kid at the beginning that's like 'argh whatever' lol
Is it difficult taking care of so many puppies? Their enclosure is really nice!
They‚Äôre so beautiful! You‚Äôre an amazing person giving them this life‚ù§Ô∏è
Look how happy she and her babies are! Amazing. Pitties are SO stinkin cute.
OP... Good for you... You can see the thanks in that Momma's eyes... 

You're a good person... Hope you get Momma fixed and give her a good home, and find one for all the kiddies when the time comes...

Good Luck... Be well...
I love the snort. My pitbull would make noises and my friend said we'd get animal control called on us one day for keeping livestock. Little cow piggy whiner.
Sweet Velvet Land Hippos. So many cute Pibbles.
it wasn't a pregnant street dog. it was a happiness factory.
Was that French?  Chien = dog in French IIRC.
That's a lot of puppies.
Thank you SO MUCH!! I don't know about where you are, but where I live, our shelters and animal control in every town is full of %99 pit bulls that end up getting put down. It is so fricking heartbreaking to see.. So when I see stories like this, that show these loving beautiful dogs alive and happy with their babies instead of all sad and crying at the top of their lungs, miserable, only to get put down, this makes my day.. Thank you so much for showing that sweet momma dog and all those adorable babies so much love and kindness when most people wouldn't.
A lot of cute dogs
Okay so I am going to need to know where you are. I want of them little guys!! I love pitties! Especially blue/grey types
The mama is my favorite with her little wiggle butt. So cute. Thank you for helping her and her babies, OP!
God bless you.

Thank you. Those doggos appreciate you, and I do too.

Thank you for being a good human. My dog was once a pregnant street dog, and now she's the bestest most spoiled dog. :)
I can‚Äôt function. They are so precious üò≠üíôüíôüíô

Very pretty backyard!
That's the best garden for a bunch of puppers who like to hide! I'm pretty sure they all agree, too <3
Thank you kind human for rescuing such a sweet mama!!
You are the best kind of human

Please talk to me and my son again

Oh, my heart!
A mano que fofo
That‚Äôs a lot of shit to clean
So what happens in this situation - do you keep all of the dogs or try and find each of them loving homes?  Thinking of the mom having her pups taken away is also sad :(

Lil staffies :)
Or they are upto a escape route.
Aaawwwww love me some puppers

They looks so happy and healthy! What a wonderful thing you did!
This is the cat video with a nicer backyard
Could be that their mother teach them that since who knows how long she was on the street and there you want to be hidden.
Suddenly.. puppies!
So she's milking her puppies AND pregnant too?
Boop!
Your a good person. There's a spot for you in heaven.
Is it my cake day?
Every dog needs a home and a good care to be itself.

It's a flock of puppies!

Oooh look people, the babies are here. And this is the mom‚Äù
Awwwww thanks for giving them a home!!!
Beautiful mama, adorable babies and amazing rescuers!!!
No idea why but this reminds me of All Dogs Go to Heaven
That‚Äôs a big and healthy litter!
The only game of hide and seek I'd enjoy
Why is r/all full of people opening things to yards filled with animals.
Thank you for this. You've got lots of pups to look after!
Ai, Cl√©o, carai kkkkkkk
You‚Äôre a saint for rescuing mom and her puppies. Wish you all the best!!
People like you are a gift to the world.

The joy on her face is so priceless.
The happiness of the mother. So fucking beautiful.
Ahhh meu sonhoooo üòçüòçüòç

Well done :D

Gf and I found a stray kitten last winter and bought her inside. Vets put her at about 3 months.
We looked after her and after a while, she managed to unlock a window (yes, UNLOCK) a window and got pregnant... slag.

Anyway, we now have her and two gorgeous kittens üòÄ
Can I come play?
I have no idea what you're saying but it's adorable
Awwwwwwwww pitbulls always make me happy!
I wanna look at the mama dog.. she is happy. I need that happiness
I was worried this post would not show the dogs.
God bless you. You'll do tons of valuables good thinks in your life but it will be almost impossible to overcome this one. Thank you.
SO MANY TINY CHUBBY BELLIES AGGHHHHHH
OP is why I still occasionally have faith in humanity. Thank you OP!
The one in the crate will have totally different personality then the rest of them.

This is the best thing today.
How do people who rescue dogs not just keep them all?
Adorable
Love is love.
This is the best thing on the internet today hands down.
My pup always greets me like the momma pup... whole body shaking with excitement. We don‚Äôt deserve dogs!
How is it the momma is even cuter than the puppies? She looks so happy to have you helping her!

I am jealous of your backyard! Good job on the rescue.
They‚Äôre looking for a cosy place to sleep, but when mum runs off like that it may be dinner time
Anyone recognize that language? Help a stranger out.
Can I live with you too?
Beautiful backyard and soul!

@dragonhaaa tell me about your back yard please.  Does it just flood a lot or what's going on here?
That's great. Needed something like that.
Effing superhero move bro.
Im not gonna lie. That was exactly what i needed today.
Can I be you, please?
Do mother dogs get sad when their puppies get adopted?
OMG, the mother looks so happy and so thankful. It makes me cry to think of the situation she must have been in and how you absolutely changed her world and gave her the security and safety she needed for her and her pups. You're a saint.
Momma knows she can get 5 minutes of quiet if you say you are playing hide and go seek. Its the first trick in the parent play book.
She looks so happy!
Wholesome
THIS!  This is heaven. You did a really great thing. 
They look so happy and healthy. Mom included.
Good human, bestest doggos
That yard is gonna get sooo much natural fertilizer
Bless you <3
My friend when I was younger had an Irish setter that had 14 babies.
That backyard is small but very cozy! I like that little water run off area a lot. Also that's so many dogs!!
They all look so happy, especially the mom. You're the hero they all deserve.
They‚Äôre all so precious!ü•∞

You gave that dog and her babies happiness and most importantly, safety. Thank you!
You're out numbered.... GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE!!!!!!

Those puppies came out of the wood work.
Pits are such sweet, happy dogs when people treat them well.
What happens to the babies now? I‚Äôm sad.
I‚Äôve watched this 13 times and cannot stop smiling(crying). They are all so happy.
You deserve all the karma you got from this and much much more.
The babies are adorable, but I wanna see more of your yard. It looks lovely! Like a little hideaway.
Is the one in the crate sick?
Ooooooohhhhhhh Hello!!!!!!!
That's fucking adorable
Aww I want one
Br
Thanks for sharing with your post - really made me smile and feel happy inside!

I'm reading posts and see that there's 9 pups!  Well done to have them all and mum so healthy and happy.  It takes work but also a special heart.
Cute! I am sure they are all happy to be safe and have a home.
Que fofinha!
Would this be a survival tactic? Every video I see of people rescuing momma dogs the babies are always hidden somewhere while she goes and gets food.
This made my day.
Thank you for helping her.
