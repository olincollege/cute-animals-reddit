Funny story:

I have a cat that looked just like that as a kitten. 

One day I go to pick him up and his tail puffs up and he runs away afraid. I didn't understand. 

We actually figured out it's because I wasn't wearing my slippers. Being a little dude with tiny eyes he couldn't make out faces! We did some test and confirmed he recognized us by the footwear we had on until he was a little less smol.

Edit: He had the sniffles, eye infections, tics, fleas and worms. He couldn't see very well.

He sleeps on my shoulders while I work and needs to be in contact with a human at all times - We also need to brush his teeth every day with chicken flavored toothpaste because he has gingivitis. We love him very much! 
Such a tiny little orange bump on the floor.  So cute!
This is why I slide a foot backwards before moving away from a kitchen counter. Kittens are always at your heels and easy to step on

Ima big oaf, AMA
Saved this for when I desperately need warm and fuzzies down the road...❤️

Fuuuuck I thought this was a gif and he was cutting something slowly.
TFW something’s so cute it makes you mad
It’s so tiny!! 
Oh my god, a tiny adorable kitten waiting for Daddy to give him food! 

**LOOK HOW TINY**
Shadow of the Colossus right there, but with nigh unlimited grip strength.
Thought this was a video and was waiting for like 10 secs for him to give this little boi something lol
this man has bathroom towels on his oven
The master waits patiently for his slave to deliver sustenance.
Oh goodness!! What a baby! I wish our kitten was like that. She has zero chill. Instead she screams the whole time and tries to crawl up your leg. :/
I can hear its "mewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww" "mewwwww"
So wee... 💕
Smol 
Ah my god. So round and smol. 
That cat is officially too small.

It is disqualified from cat.
I turned my back on a kitten once. The next thing I knew, tiny-needle-claws had dug their way up the entire back of my leg. 
It's crazy to me that these very smol lil babies trust giant, clumsy, loud creatures like us. 
Reminds me of bean bunny in Muppet Christmas Carol. “Penny for the song, govnah?”
Do we... do we kill it precious? 

No.. no...master is kind, gives fooood. -cat probably.
aww...S/he’s sooo tiny.
This kind of gives me anxiety. He so tiny. What if he gets stepped on? How do people live with such teeny things? 
Is his name Tang?
Something about seeing lil baby animals next to tall people just fills my heart with joy. Maybe that's why I love these r/aww posts so much.

It really says something about animals in general, that even just pictures can make you feel better than you were before seeing them.
That is the most adorable thing I have ever seen 
Feed the damn minicat
Kitty is just trying to figure out the best way to scale your bare legs, claw your shorts to ribbons and leave little bloody holes in your shoulder when it gets up there where it really wants to be.
What a patient/adorable lil guy.
*the stupid giant biped makes my food*
Please be very careful walking around the house. At night have nightlights and flashlight. 🙏🙏
ITS THE SIZE OF HIS FOOT
Here we have a member of the itty bitty kitty committee.
Make it quick, Jerry!
my heart is melting!!! My bf and I have been fostering kittens this year and they are such a joy to us!! Delicate little devils!! 
Please sir, I want some more.
Ohhh it’s so tiny 
SO SMOL I NEARLY MISSED IT
The little cat let me think of a cat sleeping on my foot. How small he is. My foot is his warm bed. I miss him so much. 
I thought this was video 
I was really hoping my Internet was just slow and it was a video 
while you're waiting you might as well help him clean that before he cooks it
Reminds me of my orange tabby when he was that small, though he would sometimes stand almost right behind us too.
Hims so tiny!!!!
This reminds me of those fantasy drawing memes where it’s a tiny guy vs some gigantic dragon. But cuter.
Ahhhhhh this is the cutest thing I’ve seen today. Thank you. 
Smol cat. 
My name is Cat,

Am very smoll,

My fur is ginger,

And that's all.

I like to play

And make a mess,

My hooman likes it

More or less.

But when it's time

To get my plate -

I slow my pace.

I sit and wait.

So freaking adorable! 
what is that tiny thing?  a ferrule?  
This is so cute I burped
The size ratio! Too cute
That's a really giant man in a really giant kitchen.
The patience is strong with this one..
I was waiting for this image to move.
It's so tiny!
I had to keep scrolling through my feed to see the cat, was not disappointed 
Are those bath towels? 
u/Chr0n041ph4


Wait I dont see any-


*cries*
STOP. MY HEART CANNOT TAKE SUCH CUTE. I NEED ANOTHER KITTEN NOW UGH 😍😍😍
Awwwwwww
Just waiting for next pics showing kitten climbing his bare leg, shorts, and sitting on his shoulder.😸
I thought this was a gif 😭
THEY MAKE EM THAT SMALL?? 😱😱😱
Reminds me of my little Embers. She is about a year and a quarter and she was a teeny little tangerine not that long ago.
Wow i thought this was a video. Lol
u/iceaxe99
OHHHH THAT IS A TINY MAN. LOVE HIM.
Or I will poop in your footwear hooman!

Grrrr, Arf! Arf! Woof!

So cute and sooo tiny 😍😍😍
So smooolllll!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
The size of it! It’s adorable!!!!
My cat does this all the time...
Feed me hooman
Ok, there’s an adorable miniature kitten on the floor, but shall we please talk about the elephant in the room: who uses bathroom towels in the kitchen??!
so smol!
How precious.  Our (wife and I) rescue kitty opted to scale our bare legs to get to the food every feeding time.  Poor thing was starving when we rescued her.  People thought I was self harming. 
Well goddamn if that ain't the cutest thing I've seen today 
That pikachu is the size of a rat!! So teeeeny !!
The kitty is so small, I would need to tie a ballon to its tail or something.

Ngl I cried a little 
Dude that cat probably thinks you're an absolute MONSTER of a giant. He probably thinks you're his giant friend. You look about 6'3 if i had to guess. 
That is one small cat
NOT waiting for food. Deciding how to maximize damage while scaling human legs enroute to shoulders...
#I CAN HAZ CHEEZBURGER?

[Just give it to him! ](http://imgur.com/a/pXsyYTe)
They learn quickly 
Our little monsters climbed us when we fed them. 
Careful, a grape would crush him
This melted my heart! 
I missed the smol one the first time I looked and thought it was a phantom cat. A good cropping might have helped.
So tiny too pure too cute I can't take it 
Oh he/she is tiny and adorable.
Chopping up onions for some tuna?
I'm evil cat

I want to and don't want to hold it at the same time haha so small and fragile but the meows are the best at this size haha

Better feed it before you get attacked!
So patient
It's so smol
Or planning vengeance.
Cute Rage level orange

Patience is key little one.
SO CUTE
@radiatebro
Incredibly cute.
Give it to him u monster
Look at that little tail that's a sweet baby
We need this recreated 1 year from now
The picture oddly reminds me of Shadow of the colossus.
I love their tiny triangle tails at that age.


*cats, not the feeding dudes
Am I the only one who saw this with him moving a little bit?  IDK its late.
One tiny boi
I have reason to suspect your account was compromised and is being used to farm karma.  Your pattern of posts and comments changed dramatically in the last two weeks.
So tineee^^^^^^tinyyy
I want that kitten.
Major cute aggression here. 
Please give me back my heart.
"Please sir, may I have s'more?"
Oh. My. Glob.
Do you live in the model house from arrested development??
It's so tiny!
Lort ❤️
Making kitty a sammich
Am I the only one that thought this was a gif and sat here for a good 30 seconds before realizing it wasn't moving.......
Orange tabbies are my favorite
That's the most American kitchen I have seen all day 
Omg don't step on him!
OMG perfect kitten body. 
Mine jumps on the counter and beats the shit out of anyone who dares walk by her without feeding her, even if she already ate.
That's my Annie! Always hungry!
Just a little guy with so much trust. See, humans don't totally suck.
You or the cat?
Is your name Eric?
That god damn kitten is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.
Soooo cute.  Love how placid they are when hungry 
Mini-Carrot
First post on this sub that I've actually audibly "aww"ed at in a long time. So tiny!!!
I literally said oh my god out loud at this cute kitty 😻😻😽😽😽😽
So it begins 
Why does this look like base housing lol
🙊
This is adorable 
"Faster slave!"

/u/shitty_watercolour, diamond and champ....break my fucking heart you piece of shit...
So tiny! 
That’s the teeniest kitty I’ve ever seen ❤️
Aww
My cat was that tiny when I got him. Fit in the palm of my hand
KITTEH !!! 
Such a polite baby. My kittens will climb your leg to get at food. I wake up to one licking my mouth every morning either to wake me for breakfast or wants my dinner from last night. It’s completely unacceptable 
Jesus Christ, I didn’t know kittens could be that small lol. I don’t think I could handle taking care of that cat bc I’d be worried about accidentally stepping on it all the time
For some reason I thought this was a gif. Was waiting forever for someone to move..
Shadow of the Colossus
I hope the kitten owner would be extra careful 
Jesus I would be scared of stepping on it
So tiny. It needs some kind of harness/helium balloon deal. I’d be so worried. 
Baby want SNACK
FEEED KETTEH!
Omg a lil orange bean
so cute
My heart be still 😩
Do they learn early or is it just instinctual behavior?

In either case, you definitely learn it well!
^waah
This will continue for 18 years (if you are lucky).  Also, it will get noisier.
So much cuteness and patience all at once I can’t handle 
Faster you monster! She's hungry!
This makes me happy 

That’s so adorable! 😍
You will feed me human.
Good human.
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.
I CANNOT 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Me waiting for my boyfriend to make me a snack 
I can't be the only one who thinks small cats sitting in the middle of a floor is adorable 
My battery is low, if this is the only post I see tonight, I'm glad this was it!
My god the cuteness 
I read the title as "waiting for god" I didn't even question it. I'm tired and reddit has broken me. 
I need a kitten for Christmas. 
I just want to cup this kitten in my hands
Look at that little fuckin guy! Omg dawwww
FEED THAT BABY NOW!
Omg, that is SO CUTE! Love the grown man making food for such an itty bitty kitty.
I screamed really loud for some reason, that is by far the cutest thing I have ever seen.
Mew
Aww, my heart.
Aww hurry please. Adorable!!
So smart.

The microwaves open..

GD giants in that house! That kitchen is a least twice the size of a normal kitchen.
It took me forever to realise that it's not a gif...
2 of my 3 cats are chill when I’m dishing out soft food. My third cat, Lemmy, tho? Oh my GOSH, that tiny, 5.5 pound monster is LOUD and AGGRESSIVE about wanting his soft food!! Lol
Never seen this Pokemon
He’s so small. Awe. Mew.

Cat.
Aweeee such a cutie!! 
Patience is virtue.
smol

Same bro 
Dad! Are you done??? 
I've fostered dozens of kittens from as young as 1 week old. Only stepped on a few of them, with nothing hurt but feelings. 
And all to fast they go from smol to kitchen sink big and clog your drains
Why do all american kitchens look the same?! :O
That is almost an exact copy of my kitchen... 
Is that the tall man from It Follows D;
I imagine him singing a random made up song to his little buddy like I do during prep work for his dinner time.
That baby would get all the food!
My heart
Jim Halpert and Sprinkles?
😁
This is kind of creepy... I look like that, dress like that and lived in an apartment  that looks like that (tiles, stove, cabinets, microwave). That's not me though I also never had a kitten.
Looks like a Shea home. 
My kitten was extremely tiny as well (still is) his favorite place to be when he was tiny was right by my butt. I almost sat on him one too many times 
How cute is that?!?
I thought that was a mouse goddamn. Absolutely gutted. How did it do that smallness?! Insane. 
See so cute
thats absolutely cute
So tiny!!
[removed]
definition of smol 
i would give that kitty the best of hugs and love while waiting for his food to get ready
Make me a sandwich, Hooman! 
Lol! He looks just like my friend
I kept staring waiting for something to happen then realized it’s not a video. 
Such a cute kittie, waiting for food that made by his dad.
Pretty sure this is the first pic in which an
“aaaaawwwwww” was my immediate (out loud) reaction without even being aware of the subreddit. 
cute
Omg I cant even!
So much tiny 
that is a very smol kitty
Eeeeeeee!!! So super tiny!!! Very awww. 
Dear Jesus how are you doing ANYTHING with your back turned to that baby!?!?! 😭♥️
::MEW::
^^^^mew
I'm not crying you're crying
I misread the title and thought it said "waiting for blood". Which was kind of hilarious.
Sat and waited because I thought this was a video😂, cute nonetheless<3
Your pikachu does not look well. Should probably add some AA batteries to the diet. 
For some reason I thought this was a gif
Don’t step on the baby!!!!
Welcome to the rest of your life
That's so cute 
Just bite him sweetly, that is how most of human understand pet's needs 😀
Human kids can learn from that little one, impressive discipline 
MA

wtf it so smol!!!
Cat's are very selfish.
to gro big n strong kitter 
So smol❤️
My husband just said “that is so goddamn fucking adoreable” I don’t think I can think of any other way of saying it!
I’m a retired nurse. All my career I never wore my work shoes into our home. Who knows what I was picking up at the Hospital in spite of all the crazy cleaning they did there? I came in the back door of the house,leaving work shoes outside, which could get that area cluttered because I am crazy and and cannot wear the same shoes 2 days in a row! That was doable as my entire career was in the San Diego area, so weather never a problem. Your kitty is so tiny and cute OP! Enjoy him!
Be careful with your steps, hooman. There's a lion in the kittens skin.
Imagine how ballsy cats are. Regarding size difference man and cat.
Awww little one 
I wonder how many chairs there are just like that in the world.
Oh my gosh, after a day of hearing terrible disgusting things, this makes my life xxx 
So smol! <3
^^so ^^smol
That's just freaking adorable
first i didnt notice the kitten haha 
So there *are* some Americans who don't wear shoes at home! Good to know! 
It’s so cute I am melting.
Toooo cuteeeee. What a great picture 👍
I'm expecting a big ass steak on a plate for this beast
That tiny ball of fuuuuuurr <3
It's so smol and cute! 11/10 very good bean. 
So smol
I sat here for at least 10 seconds before realizing it wasn’t a video 
At first I was like "what's so cute about this?" Then  i saw the fluff ball.
Plot twist : he's gonna cook that cat
Am I the only one that stared at this for 15 seconds before realizing it was a picture! Doh!
You must have been cutting up chicken??? Penny knows the smell of chicken from at least half a mile away!!!!!!!!! She is sure to appear as soon as it is served!!!
If that guy had trousers on or if that kitten was just a lil bigger, that kitten would already be half way up his those back
Didn't see the cat for a good one minute. Thought it was the lazy op waiting for the food.
himb so tiny
I waited way too long thinking this was a video/gif.... 
I wish i had a kitten like this too...just waiting for food. Sadly, my apartment dont allow pets...
It wont be long before it will be trying to jump on the counter. OOOPS
Almost didn’t notice that kitten and was confused as to what subreddit I was looking at
^^^^^^^^^^^^smol
"Wait where are they? Ooooooomg bby!!!"
Is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9lxua9/daddy_i_must_follow_you/?st=JPNYXBM7&sh=f71c6b9c)  the same person/cat?

Just got a kitten that’s a few months old. I wake up to it literally sleeping on my head.  
This melts my ice cold heart! 
I thought this was a video at first
Such a smol pluf
The master over seeing his slave.
My heart just melted 
Ok, i think we have the same stove. Am I the only one that constantly gets the burners confused??

They use bath towels as kitchen towels. Is this legal?

i thought this was a gif for longer than id like to admit
The picture was so cute I instinctively liked it before realizing it was already at 100k. 

Holy shit that's a lot. 

Also, it's nice to see a triple Digit upvoted post for once in a while. 
When I first looked at the thumbnail was like "What's waiting for food?"    Then I noticed the tiny fur spec. 
Smol kitty

Very smol!
I live to see these posts
Hey littles!   
So..... smol
OOOO look at da wittle kitty cat :3

*hugs kitten
What a tiny kitten! I love it! 
Crazy cute.
Thanks! Gave me a big smile.
*Waiting for the GIF
Omg that is probably one of the cutest kitten pics I've seen here
I sometimes think about how houses are designed following design patterns that make humans feel comfortable, but for animals it must feel like every room is a gym hall. 
Am I the only one that stared at this for like 20 seconds thinking it was a gif?
this kitten is so tiny and cute!!!!! I'm almost crying)
Anyone else get the immediate impression his hands are moving? 
Did anyone else expect this to be a video and stare at it waiting for the kitten to move? Or do I need to go back to sleep...
He looks very patient....mine is not this patient...Good Kitty!
Be careful not to step on him/her, he/she is tiny af.
Plot twist: the guy is the food
Cuteness overloaded.
Thought this was a gif, stared at this picture for longer than I'd care to admit. Practically crying the whole time at how cute and seemingly still the kitten is! 
Why do I recognize this kitchen? 
ITS THE SIZE OF HIS FOOT
So tiny.❤️

I straight up though this was a video for a solid 3 minutes. Just sat staring at the picture waiting for something to happen.
forgot to install knobs and pulls?
oooh hhhhh so funny waiting for some food 😇
That kitten is so small it's giving me anxiety
Oh my god oh my god oh my god 
Dude has nice calves.
I feel bad for cats and doggos they must get neck pains looking up all the time. :(
My dumbass saw this as a video
Didnt even see it first, how cute !
You’ll be waiting a while for that cat to grow large enough for a decent meal. I recommend keeping it in a small cage and feed it only butter. 
*guy steps back and onto cat*
*cat dies*
*oof*
*F in chat*
it is so sMOL!  and it's so fucking cute! I have the strongest desire to KILL IT. 

I mean smother it.
