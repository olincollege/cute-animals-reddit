I never knew how big these guys are!! Still cute.
"Oh dear, oh my!"
Holy cow. I didn't realize how big sea otters are! I've only ever seen river otters in person, and they're only about 10 to 20 lb, 30lbs maximum. Apparently sea otters can get up to 100 lbs?!
HAHAHAHA the way it puts its hands to its mouth, like its anxiously waiting to find out if it has to self isolate
Checks mouth... where is fish?
This is the best Stefon impression I’ve ever seen.
It's HUGE.
He looks like he's got a super adorable secret to tell you
He's 98.precious (fahrenheit; in celsius, he's 36.adorable)
Sea otter is so ashamed of his bad breath... very self aware of his fishy smell.
I think it’s surprised that it wasn’t taken at the other end.
He looks so concerned 🙀
Cutie ☺️
After the first check it looks like the otter is self conscious about their breath and starts covering their mouth. In the subsequent checks they barely open their mouth as well. 
(Obviously that’s not what’s happening and I’m just projecting)
“Oh bother, piglet”
🥺 ooohh give the little guy a treat! He deserves it! If only my three year old was that compliant. 
*one can only dream*
Thats the perfect embodiment of the anxiety you experience when you suddenly ask yourself if you left the stove on at home.
Cmon human give me good news
So unbelievably cute. Made me think of this. (Please bear in mind it’s from 1992)

It’s from a stand up show by Denis Leary.

I love how it’s hands on it’s cheeks, “oh gosh, this is so embarrassing”
Holy cow, I'm dying! This guy is too precious for words. The way he smooshes his face while he waits is so darn cute!!
Dont be fooled by this act sea otters are demons.
“Oh my goobness, I swear I only had one beer officer”
I love sea otters. Grew up in the SF Bay Area and it was always a treat seeing them swim beside the piers doing otter things.
He reminds me of Stefon on Saturday night live..... The bays hottest club is Kelp. This place has everything. Shiny rocks. An oyster bar where you name everything you eat. MTV's Dan Cortez
Is it otter than it's supposed to be?
Miss otter: “Oh my oh my, hope it’s ok”
Otterly adorable
>is this a treat? Am I getting a treat? Oh God what if I can't taste treats anymore. Is life even worth living at this point?
"I hope my breath smelled okay"
there's an app for that
Reminds me of Stefon from SNL!!
I almost thought there was a glass partition between the otter and the..... Uh ... Caretaker(was that the proper term?) because of the way the otter was standing
"oh nooo - am i ok?"
"Oh... Did I brush my teeth this morning?"
I had no idea a sea otter could be this big and this adorable 🥰
Otter is like, OMG don't tell me!!
Ahhhh...

Oh...

Ahhh...

Oh...
Oh Dear! I’m HOtter than I thought.
Oh dear. Oh my.
Am I having a moment or does his fur look tinged blue ? So cute
Oh dear, am I pregnant?
He acts like a really nice and shy lady who is complying with the government to have her checked up.
He looks so worried and so cute at the same time! ❤

Which direction is evolution going to take otters?  Their forelimbs are very advantageous so i can't see them loosing them to a fin.  If they spend any great amount of time on land i cant see them loosing their rear limbs.

Edit: maybe they will keep the same form but get more dangerous claws/teeth and grow in size
