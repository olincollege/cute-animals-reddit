I worked at a pet shop. We had bunnies! I had to clean their cage. When I would start shredding newspapers one rabbit would come over and "help" me. He would grab a corner of the paper and pull, making long strips and then he'd push it to the side and do it again. I loved that rabbit. I bought him, but asked them to hold him there for a couple days so I could buy his cage. 


I went in to get him and the cage and they said they sold him!!! I said I already paid for him and they knew that! They refunded my money, I quit with tears in my eyes. I loved him!! (Still mad about it.)


Edit: Thank you all! Very much!
That look at the end is killing me! Bunny is really like "do that again. I dare you!"
I had only ever observed wild bunnies until I was about 30, and assumed they were meek, shy little things.  Then I got one. Turns out they're feisty as hell and _extremely_ opinionated. :)
Love it when bunnies do this, also the look he gave you at the end, I'd stop messing up the sheets if I were you.
Except for the fact that they really live for destruction lol. If I organize my bun’s room, he’ll make sure he destroys all sense of order.
Sightlines bruh sightlines. There could be a fox behind any mound...
that angry look at the end :D
That stare afterwards.

Chilling.
I love how he looked at the camera like.. what have I told you about this.
Aaaand he peed on the bed like 10 seconds later.
He looks so disappointed at the end
I would like to know where he got his pants from, they’re very stylish
It’s like rabbit from Winnie the Pooh lol.
My bunny who passed many years ago would play this game with blankets, too. He would get so indignant and sometimes would grunt as well. This brought a smile to my face remembering him!
Ain’t gon be “neat and tidy” when he shit on that bed
**clicks tongue*
Careful, he might turn into Monty Python's killer rabbit if you keep messing with the sheets.
What a fine rabbit! He's also wearing pants, very classy.
And then he leaves some cocoa puffs on the sheets.
This bunny is the embodiment of every mom when they say: “do I have to do everything in this fucking house?? Nobody helps me!!”
I've rescued 3 bunnies over the least 10-12 years or so. My Roxy recently passed and I miss her doing this! It's my favorite bunny behavior, I used to say she was "making the bed." So cute. One day I'll rescue another.

RIP Roxy, I think about you every day!
the stare at the end clearly shows who has authority over this household
Bunny:”Ugh! EXCUSE ME. Rude.”
Rabbits don’t have much in the way of facial expressions but you can just tell that this one is pissed.
Hi, I have a bunny (magpie lop) and I was wondering how you get your bunny to not drop 800 poops and a puddle of pee every time you set it down. 

Thanks,

SaintJonah
“The fuck, Jerry? I just made that...”

- this moody ass rabbit
this is how my rabbit is. everything must be the way she leaves it. can't move or change anything without her getting mad. and rabbits can definitely have a nasty attitude some days. mine used to stomp her feet when mad
D'aww, good boy.
This rabbit is my spirit animal!
#"YOU DO THAT AGAIN AND IT'S GONNA GET HARE-Y!!"
“And don’t fucking do it again.”
Bunny looked a little irritated.
I like how he just stares afterwards, probably thinking if you do it again human I will naw your eyes out of your skull the next time you sleep.
the look at the end i'm dead AHAHAHAHA
Could I borrow your bunny to do my sheets for me? Even just looking at the sheets wrong messes them up 😣
Wat a neat freak!
I just love how it looks like he's wearing little brown pants! 😍
Hehe silly dog
Lol he totally mean mugged you at the end 😂
Likes things to be nice and tidy

Poops every minute
He’s got little pants on
Are bunnies normally tidy animals?
That's how I like things
That's some serious r/MurderBuns material!
Is that common behaviour for the 🐰?
A very clean boi
He’s like “what’s wrong with you? I already showed you how I like it” 😄
That is exactly what my bunny looks like
That look at the end is the type of look a Mother would give to their teenager.
He looks so soft.
The pandemic has made him have OCD too
Where can I get one of these bed making bunnies?!
He's tidy like Rabbit from Winnie the Pooh. Adorable!
I think I need this rabbit.
TIL i'm married to a rabbit
The rabbit gave her that “Do it again, I dare you” look at the end
Bunny at the end be like

HOOMAN DONT YOU DARE DO IT AGAIN
and my rabbits here destroying my garden
That look at the end 🤣 “Getting real tired of your crap, Brenda.”
I’d visit my Mom at assisted living, take her out for a walk, and we’d watch the squirrels.  They dig at something, then pat it all back down.   So tidy.
The look at the end said, I'm Getting sick of your shit carl
That little look at the end looks like he’s frowning. 😂😂😂
“I’d like to see you try that shit again. 😑😑😑”
The way that rabbit looks at them like “you lil shit!”
OCB bunny!
your bunny is judgey as fuck
Angry bunny face be real, I usually get the side eye glare of not caring for my existence.. of course, he loves the women, acts all sweet then 🤔😁
A very meticulous bunn! He has standards.
the bunny said pat pat
You have a good bunny!

Mine always pissed on my bed...
I love you, Schnoodle. We need a Schnoodle Ask Me Anything.

I’m actually really surprised animals aren’t more picky about how their houses are kept- clean and tidy is how they survive in the wild.

Cute but also massive repost, like this is literally from a month ago
For anyone saying "this bunny has OCD lolz", that isn't was OCD is.



OCD is a servere mental health disorder, inwhich a sufferer has intrusive thoughts (obsessions) of harm to them, family, property, etc. Then in order to cope with that, they have compulsions, or ritualistic behaviors. Like constant hand washing, stuff having to be in perfect spots, if they make a mistake while typing they have to restart, for me I have one with doing a ritualistic pattern on light switches (3 seconds on, 2 seconds off, 3 on, 2 off, 3 on, 2 off, 2 on, 3 off, 2 on, 3 off.) Checking my phone volume, etc.



Please do mistake wanting to be tidy, with having a servere mental disorder, that has a impact on everyday life.
All rabbits have ocd.

YES.
Rabbit is thinking “Keep f&&king around frank, and there’s gonna be some “raisins” left on your pillow.”
I used to have a rabbit that had the same color pattern except a slightly lighter brown. She loved to push things with his nose to fall to the ground.

So cute...I need him.

My spirit animal
u/savevideo
He doesn't. The reason the animal does this is because its mind believes there is a predator under the sheets, and the animal gets anxiety. In a natural environment, the rabbit would not need to worry about such things, because there's nothing underneath the dirt for the rabbit to be afraid of.
Does he poop and ejaculate on your shoes? Mine did, also pooped on my wife while she was sleeping. This was around teenage bunny years. He’d thump at us when we tried to get him back in his cage after humping our shoes. Was a great little boy till the sex drive kicked in lol.
