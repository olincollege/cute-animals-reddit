What causes the fainting?
"I got you"
How the hell do you train a dog to do that. Glad you have him
My dog farts sometimes when he sneezes.
I love dogs so much
So if someone approached you, while you are passed out - will doggie protect you? Like someone with bad intentions. Not someone trying help but if someone was like oh sweet I can steal this persons wallet, would the dog go full protect mode?
A great pupper.
How does that happen? Is it like narcolepsy? I'm sorry if it sounds rude. I don't know enough.
Belgian Malinois?
If it’s ok to ask: What would happen if someone tired to approach you to see if they can help you? Would your dog get defensive?
"Hey you. You're finally awake."
What a good doggo. 

Mine just would use the opportunity to raid the kitchen and rub her bits on my pillows before taking a nap.
Daw. I love him 🥰
Wow. I’m sorry you have to go through that, but glad you have such a loyal sidekick.
The bestest good boy or girl you could wish for.
Awwww... Good to have ya back Sir
What a GOOD fucking dog. Deserves all the loves, pets, and treatos.
Now that’s a good boy/girl
I've woken up to much worse
That’s a good friend right there
How long before you pass out does your service animal normally alert you?
The goodest pup!
One of my kids has vasovagal syncope. This is wonderful as the risk of head injury is huge. Bless you and your little hero.
This is why I love animals. They’re so much better than humans.
Not join at trained well but I think he loves you and worries about you.
What causes you to faint?
So glad you have someone to be with you wherever you need them, and they look so sweet
That is the coolest thing ever
Wonderful boy
Oh my. Dogs are so smart!
As someone who has a wife who sufferers from seizures, how do I go about getting a furry friend for her?
Service dogs are so fucking incredible. Like all dogs are great, but service dogs are another level of angel
we don’t deserve dogs 😭😭
The dream!
Beautiful pup. Do you mind if I ask what causes the regular fainting?
Do you have Vaso Vagel?
Your dog looks like [mine](https://i.redd.it/54ilv12317z71.jpg)! So precious. Is he/she a Belgian malinois?
Dogs are special.
Well luckily YOU can pet him
Amazing. How does your good dog alert you of an eminent incident?
Dog is probably so bored
What breeds are your dog? I have a corgie/mastiff female with the same coloration….thicker and short legs.
I had a dog that could alert me to incoming seizures and helped get me to a safe space too. God damn I miss that dog so much!!!!
We don't deserve dogs. 😭💖
And here I thought me and my dog were special. I tend to have extremely bad RLS in my sleep. To tge point I've broken my ankles 3 times. Broken toes to many times. 

Trained my husky to lay across my legs when it's about to happen and been good for about 3 years with 0 issues.

And before anyone states the obvious, I could put the bed away from a wall but then I tend to fall off tge bed due to the RLS
Service dogs are such special animals. We all know that dogs are usually far better than then their human counterparts. Dogs trained to protect us, go above & beyond what’s defined as unconditional love. I’m so glad you’ve got such a beautiful dog to watch over you. What special little beings they are. I hope your health is going ok & am so glad, you’ve got a RL guardian angel to protect you! 💕

Edit: I just wanted to say this image made me tear up. Such beautiful devotion is a such a gift. We don’t deserve dogs!
Both of my dogs have always had different ways of alerting my sibling and I of panic attacks before we know they're happening. Whether its them laying on you, laying their head on you and apply more and more weight till you calm down, or just giving annoying amounts of kisses. Several animal psychologists have just flat out said to get them certified as ESA's. Dogs are just amazing, we don't deserve them.
r/dogswithjobs
I’ve always heard of POTS dogs and I love that people use them. My roommate may have it and is in the process of getting diagnosed, and I suggested a service dog like this for her. I’m always so glad to see service animals like this so happy to do their job. It’s crazy what animals know. I recently got diagnosed with MDD, and realized my dog who I got as a puppy has been interrupting my depressive episodes and sitting on my chest when I’m really bad for a reason. It became a habit she started when we first brought her home when I was grieving the loss of my last dog, and every day after school when I came home burnt out she would lay on my chest til we both fell asleep and I felt better. Same thing when I had a pretty bad episode during the pandemic, lord of licking my hand to get my attention and laying on me.

All this to say dogs are amazing and probably don’t realize how important they are to us.
I don’t trust anyone who doesn’t like dogs. Dogs are incredible animals. This ability to sense a medical emergency before it occurs is truly amazing. Dogs, man. 🥺❤️
Good dog.
Awesome dog.
This is so sweet, it made me tear up. 🥲
That pupper needs so much love! Animals are too good for us.
The best pup
“Ok, he’s down now, so I can catch a nap too”
Just amazing. We don’t deserve dogs.
What does she do to alert you?
What kind of heart problem do you have?
I'm sorry you suffer. Waking up to love is a good way to wake up. Wish you all the best
My friend had a dog that would alert her before she had a seizure then lay on top of her until she was done seizing.  Trained service dogs are amazing.
Guardian Puppy angel ❤❤
He's a good friend.  Best of luck to you.
Is your wallet ever missing?
Thats aint no service dog, that’s a service dawg
What smart dog. Mine barks at his own farts.
Awwwwww. Also, you OK dude?
Aww
Awwww!!  Please tell me your service dog also goes into guard mode while you're unconscious.
This is objectively the goodest boy on earth

In this situation how do we help?
Is this good doggie a Belgian Malinois by any chance??
Beautiful dog!! And wow what an amazing service dog!!
Dogs are absolutely incredible. They can pick up these signs that are happening in our own bodies that we have no idea about. It never ceases to amaze me.

Good doggo
We DEFINITELY dont deserve dogs.
Good boy!
That is one of the best ways to wake up
I just got a German shepherd puppy (almost 5 months old).  I live in Guatemala but am from the United States.  I plan to bring her back once she's been through the whole vaccine regime the US requires.  Can anyone point me to the process of getting her service trained?  I have low blood sugar and would love her to be trained to sense that and alert me with snacks attached to her collar.
Vasovagal reflex?

Honestly, dogs, man. They are just... come on. They are the best.
Such a good boy.

What a good doggy
I train support dogs like this. Thank you so much for sharing, it's such a rewarding process
r/animalsbeingbros
My dog suffers from anxiety. I’m her service human.
I have never, in my entire life felt more love for a human than I have for my dogs and cats (with two notable exceptions, my daughter, and my wife).  Beyond that, there's no one.  It's stuff like this that sets them apart.  They don't care about what you do to make a living, what "lame" thing you may have done in the past... they just love you and give you their unwavering loyalty here in the present.

With exception of the two people I listed above, I have - at some point - been betrayed (or otherwise let down) by virtually every human being I know.  But I have never been betrayed by a single animal in my entire life.  And I honestly prefer their company because of that fact.
My dog has epilepsy and has seizures every now and then and this is how he lays on me afterwards. Dogs and their owners take care of each other ❤️
I‘m in tears 😭
"I'll be here no matter what"
Service animals are superheroes!
He protecc
Crazy. My dog would go through my pockets and eat my wallet
What a great bestie!
I fucking love dogs
Angel on 4 legs...!!
(Well, 6, seeing as she's sleeping on YOUR two legs... lolz 😁🦮👼🏻)
Dogs can be trusted
My dog use to bark and paw at me before I would pass out also. He learned it as a puppy from my first service dog. It’s amazing how great they are at doing this. Your dog is beautiful
The amazing things about Dogs is that they can communicate Love and friendships  ,Cats can too
Dogs are the fucking best.
If your dog alerts on someone else do you tell them to sit the fuck down?
"yay! my human is about to faint. free snuggles"
I love how he/she is protecting you. Just by this photo I can imagine the relationship you have with this wonderful dog. I hope he/she gets lots of love and of course, treats. Good job, pup!
Dubious
My dog alerts before I seize. Woke up yesterday with my head on his back. I fucking love my Hugo. 

Sometimes I pretend he's Hispanic and call him chugo. He thinks it's funny.
Now that's a great dog

![gif](giphy|3o7aTzm7USlf7kk1VK|downsized)
So sorry you are having this issue. Looks like you found an angel to watch over you. I can’t imagine. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I suffer from epilepsy, and once had a mini seizure outdoors.  I came to and found my dog trying to pull me to the house; she was a huge Lab (and outweighed me by about 40 pounds), and I was nearly to the stairs!  They are amazing!!

Even if I read this post a thousand times, I still don’t think I’d be able to get through it once without crying. ❤️🥲
“I just might have a problem, that you’ll understand… We all need, somebody, to lean on”.   🎶
Lazy dog. I do the same to my spouse.

> regain consciousness. 

> where am I ? Did I faint ? Am i injured?  

> fuck that, where’s my phone ? I need to take a picture for internet points
I drank like a gallon of coconut water today and am currently shitting my brains out
I read it as “my service dog farts before I faint so that I can find a safe spot to be unconscious” lmao
For future reference, what should a passerby do if they find someone unconscious like this, especially if they have a dog with them that presumably will be guarding them from harm until they come to?

Edit: I never said I WOULDN'T call emergency services. I'm asking about what FIRST AID techniques would be useful.
Ok, hear me out. What if, when the dog is tired, it alerts you to lie down and find a comfy spot. Then, when you pass out, you’re safe, but what is really happening, is that the dog is tricking you into lying down, which makes it easier to fall asleep? Everybody naps and your dog wakes up a hero. This dog may be even smarter than we realize!!!
How do you feel about people using untrained animals as emotional support service animals?
Farma karming
If I woke up in those kicks I would play dead
Using you medical condition to take a picture as soon as you wake up for fucking Karma. What a joke the world is

“My service dog alerts before I faint so that I can find a safe spot to…”

😵

😴

—7 hours later—

“ be unconscious. This is what I wake up to.”

[Post]
What an amazing pup! Among the various possible causes, pulmonary hypertension causes fainting and often gets missed.
I feel like there’s a deeper reason to hide your body when you faint. I think she’s hiding something so no one will find you. /s
& this is why dogs are better than people.
😂😂
My service dog mounts your mom
For the love of god fix the tongues of your shoes.
I hope you have a care for the dog if you dont wake up.

We should have specced heavy into dogs so we could be on some Avatar level business. What beautiful flesh robots.
I have a favorite joke about open (or concealed) carry which goes "What are you so afraid of?"
To which the answer is "Fuckin nothin!"
That's relevant here.
Good boy/ girl gonna protect you no matter what.
My niece has an “emotional support animal.” (A cat.) Which in the vast majority of cases IS NOT the same as a service animal. She and her classmates just use the excuse so that they can get single dorm rooms and have cats in their rooms. It makes me so angry! Does the cat provide “emotional support,” of course, all pets do. Should it be protected under the ADA? Fuck no! The last service her cat did was shit in her shoe because she didn’t like her new food.

I think daily meditation and a pillow pet would accomplish the same thing. Again, this is my niece and I know her like I would my own kid. She is taking advantage of a liberal system allowed by her NE, small, liberal arts college.

Aww. With a protector like that, you will be safe anywhere!

Sorry to hear of the heart issues. Love your best friend for sure. So what are the options these days? Are there robot- terminator hearts yet or is it strictly transplant?
Sweet girl. Doing a great job.

This is beautiful.
Malinois? Hard to tell from the angle but they are for sure smart and loyal enough to do that job well. I had a BSD who was just a third time reject at a shelter and never formally trained to do a job but she was the best gorl.
Good dog.
Awwwwww I want a BFF like that
I'm not a dog person really, but I wish my dad would have had this about a month ago. He was walking to the laundromat, walks in, and just passes out. We still don't know why. 

But then 2 days later after test results came back, it turns out he had covid. I don't know if covid was THE factor for him passing out, but he just suddenly total stone blackout. Hit his kidney on a table on his way down. So they had to call him an ambulance. That's some scary shit. To think that your 78 year old dad could just be ANYWHERE in the city and POOF! Falls over. I can't be around him 24/7, but it kinda makes me feel like he needs supervision at this point. 

Because what if the fainting wasn't covid related? What if he just happened to ALSO have covid, and the next time it happens is in like July? Again, no warning. Just falls over. What if he's at home where there's nobody TO call him an ambulance? 

It's scary shit, and this dog is looking more and more necessary. Only thing is, once the fainting happens, what's the dog going to do to call for help?
Such a good doggo!
Service dogs are a soft spot in my heart. Such good boys (and girls).
We don’t deserve dogs. They are amazing.
What a smart and loving dog.

How long do you have to find a safe place once the dog alerts you? Like more than a minute? Seconds?
Did not know they could that. Good pupper op.
Do you have sign that alerts other people to the issue?
We flat out do not deserve dogs. They should be the apex species

Thanks for sharing. Stay safe, and please give the furry one some scratches and love from Uncle Zaphod.
Correct me if im wrong, but your service dog has some kind of spider-sense that allows him to know when your brain is having some weird chemical reaction that indicates you are about to faint?

Edit: Nevermind. I just saw your post explaining how he knows. That blows my mind.

Now i have another question...does he catch when you are about to faint 100% of the time or does he sometimes not catch the signs?
this right here makes my heart melt.
🐶 ❤️
🤗🥺
Dogs are the best
My friend had a service dog and in his experience, way too many people would come up to pet the dog, despite the warning on his vest. You can train a puppy but you can’t train people to read.
Dogs are awesome. My wife has POTS and one of our dogs taught himself to alert when she has problems. Unfortunately we didn't know about her issues when he was younger or we would have really focused on socializing him and getting him good in public, but it's still extremely helpful for her at home.
This may sound foolish. Is he trained to guard you as well? Like if you were out for longer than normal and someone attempted to take your things. Or is it trained just to alert and stay by you, I know dogs with protect just seeing if that’s also part of the training
Doggo senses epilepsy even before you premonition?
Omg he is so sweet
Such a cute dog ❤️ 
Where’s the weirdest/scariest place you’ve ever fainted at?
While not as impressive our two corgis have learned to anticipate my gf bad mood swings (BP disorder) and comfort her before she even knows she needs it.

I'm sorry the people with Teacup Pomeranian "service" dogs give your good boy a bad name.
I have the sane cons, all star all the way
And to think there are extremist vegans, such as Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara, who believe cats and dogs should be banned, as they eat meat products and are part of the problem of farming. Their views are, just eliminate all farm animals and carnivore pets from the world and lets all live in a vegan world.
I am so impressed with these dogs. How lucky you are to have one. TY for sharing. What else does he do?

How do they know when you're going to faint before you do? Is it because you start stumbling and acting different and they pick up on the micro movements? So interesting

What a wonderful service dog.
Is there a program for people that already have dogs to get their dogs trained properly for free?
You are a very lucky person!
I hope you are OK. But thank God for dogs and cats. We are really NOT worthy. And I want to kiss your dog.
What a good dog.  Sorry you have a fainting disorder, glad you have a wonderful service dog, who is trained to perform a task for which you have a disability.  Unlike those other dogs that people put vests on that aren’t actually trained to perform a task and aren’t actually service dogs.  Is it POTS?   My wife has POTS and Fibromyalgia thanks to COVID, but two of my daughters had POTS, one fainted and the other had non-epileptic seizures.

Can I ask are there any down sides to having a service dog?

I have epilepsy, and own a regular shelter dog, and I enjoy the fact that after a seizure he lays with me and nudges me, occasionally licking me which makes me come round quicker. He doesn’t know when a seizure is going to happen though.

My family are always asking why I don’t look into getting a service dog, and one of my reasons is that I don’t like the thought of knowing that a seizure is coming and having no control over it. I know that sounds insane because it means I could avoid injury but to me the fear of knowing would be upsetting. 

Truthfully I luckily don’t have enough seizures to qualify for a dog I wouldn’t have thought but I can definitely see the benefit  of these dogs to a lot of people.
Goood doggo! Give em all the scritches and belly rubs.
Gotta love dogs :) very sweet help!
Such a loyal cutie!!
I got the alert. So sweet.
And this is one reason I sleep with my mattress on the floor...

Dogs are naturally connected with humans via natural reasons.
Dumb question, but: Are there service dogs that roll you on your side if you pass out? [er, are there conditions where that would be helpful?]
I’m just here to see some cake next to my name
Dogs are amazing!
Good Dog!!!! ❤️🥰✨
I wanna be a service dog.
Gj dog! Instead of calling 911 it decides to use my body as a pillow and sleep on the job /s.
Is your dog just like a pet, or do you have to treat them differently in some ways?
I had to get on Lisinopril tablets because of high blood pressure because I was only 39, but my Bp has been in hypertension stage since I was about 28 years old. It’s nothing to play around with even though I like stimulants. But it’s not worth experiencing a stroke. Life changing shit right. Love you guys. Don’t get to feeling too invincible, you’ll be let down.
Unconditional love at its finest!
Pets, service animals are the most forgiving and protective things in this world!
I'm more of a cat person, but admittedly you can't train a cat to do this. Dogs are way more compassionate.
I'm so proud of him
Awwwwwwwwwww
thats so cute but im gonna ask you some thing d you play roblox
Dogs are awesome
Got me right in the feelies it did
What does she do to alert you? (also, I love her; thank you for sharing)
So adorable
How come you don't keep your dog on a leash?
Is that a beautiful German shepherd?
I need one of those. Honestly have considered having my mini Aussie trained. He’s the smartest dog with a sixth sense.
How did you get your service dog? My wife is visually impaired and was recently diagnosed with POTS, but we've hit a wall getting her a service animal
Hey
Suddenly I realize that my Dog is a slacker.
Nothing like canine love. That is unconditionally love
Good boi!
Dogs are angels and I am so glad we have them, what an amazing dog you have there.
We seriously do not deserve dogs. What a good boy.
This was the picture I needed to wake up to on Sunday. Good for you two.
This is such a powerful and heart wrenching post. That dog doesn't know if you'll wake up again, and is probably the happiest it's ever been every time you do. Best wishes in your journey together.
How hard was it to get your process started to get your service dog?

I was diagnosed with POTS and orthostatic hypotension Iast year. On top of that my many other health issues. 

I'm starting the process soon. I have no idea where to start or even where to find reliable information.  I see my cardiologist  soon, as well as hopefully seeing a new neurologist. The last one I had was shit. Horrible bedside manner. So now I get to drive to Seattle to see a neurologist.  2 hours away. Woo-hoo. 

But I'm straying from my ???? 

What are some good reliable sites I can get info on. I talked to my psychiatrist as well as my therapist to see too and I know I have to talk to someone else now in their clinic as well. So much. Oh my.
Ugh. I get syncope a lot and I fucking hate fainting.
Are you a Potsie as well? ❤️
That is some crazy training to either prodict the future or just know the signs of your condition.  13/10 doggo
Very awesome; I have a service dog as well!
well train. wake up
nice shoes! and nice Dog :)
What an amazing trade-off and blessing to be loved and protected like that!
Good boi 👍
Best wake up ever.
Safety doggo
Beautiful sorry about your situation but you have one true friend there I see 
I love animals all they want to do is work and love
Awww you literally have a guardian angel! It’s crazy how smart some dogs are, I wish I could travel to the future to see how dogs evolve alongside humans. Maybe one day they’ll develop a language we can understand.
As said 1,000's of times...............we do not deserve them.
How long does it take to train these dogs until they are ready. And what is your condition
Uhhhhh
Cool kicks
Dogs are the best
Angels in hiding
Thank God for dogs.
Dogs are the best things humans ever created
Dogs are so much better than people
I have POTS and need to use a wheelchair because of it, how did you get your service dog? Having one would change my life, I wouldn't have to use a wheelchair as often.
Oh why do you tend to faint? (Nit trying to be rude just curious if you think it sounds rude ill remove the comment)
This right here
D-O-G

G-O-D 

COINCIDENCE????
Yo that’s so damn awesome. Literally humans best friend ❤️
How long do you typically have between the time that your dog alerts to the time you go unconscious?
Awww.
That is not a bad way to wake up from what I am sure is likely a somewhat scary situation. I have narcolepsy with cataplexy and it is not really all that bad for me, because while medicated it doesn't happen often.  Even when it does as long as I don't fight it, I can guide myself down safely. It is so infrequent that I forgot to tell people, and I think it is worse for them. I was at work talking to someone and all of a sudden I was having trouble with my words, and knew I would be going down.  The guy is still talking to me, and I just  kind of collapse to the ground.  He freaks out and calling emergency.  I am concious for all of this, but still unable to move. I have learned to just lay there for a little bit because it is hard to tell if it is completely over, and sometimes trying to tell someone I am ok just comes out as a disturbing noise that scares them more.  Getting up too soon has caused me to collapse back down with forward momentum into something.  So I have found if I just lay for 30-45 seconds before trying to get up it is fine.   It is much worse for people around that have no idea what is happening.  It often is years in between it happening (then it may happen 3-4 times in a week and then go years again), so it is not something I feel it is necessary to alert everyone to it possibly happening, but I do feel much worse for them than myself.  I am so sorry for your situation, as it seems much more serious.  At least you have an adorable friend to make it a little less traumatic when you wake up, and also give you a little notice to protect yourself.
The amount of people with similar experiences is weird.. anyone notice these post covid.. that’s when mine started.
Wholesome ♡
Great photo. I’m glad you gave him to look out for you. God bless
I have been training my lab to help me with my back issues, help me up and down the stairs, etc. I think she can sense my muscle spasms. However it is difficult to train her around family.

Dog spelled backwards.
I had a seizure cat. He would not leave my side on the days when I had seizures, and would begin purring loudly as one was coming  on. He was otherwise nearly feral and not given to cuddling.
Aww
Hhshshshs god when
Hopefully you're doing ok OP
I have a fainting problem myself. I’ve never figured out what causes it…. My grandma used to call it “the vapors” but I faint all the time.
How often do you wake up in a hospital instead because a passerby called an ambulance?  Or do you have a piece of paper on your dog/person saying what your medical needs are?

Hey op, do you have POTS?
