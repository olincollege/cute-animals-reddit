My parent's dog managed to get his lower jaw through one of these things and lodged behind his lower front fangs. 

They had to sedate him and cut it off because of the panic, never occurred to me something like that could ever happen. 

Everything was alright in the end and he still loves these bones, we just pick smaller ones now!
I love how it's dignified wolf on top and derp on the bottom.
Dexter: \*heavy sigh\* Again... really? Ok... \*lick lick\*
Omg I love this üòÇüòÇ

Be careful when those bones get really short. Years ago my dog, Copper, had one of these and I woke up in the middle of the night to her pawing around my head in a panic. She had somehow gotten the thing stuck up over her bottom teeth and around her chin with her tongue trapped inside the bone. We had to take her to the Emergency vet - who had never seen anything like that -  and they finally just had to sedate her and use a bone saw to cut it off her jaw. She was still the best dog ever!

Edit: I can‚Äôt believe there so many are other people with dogs who managed to do this. Dogs are goofy!
I thought he was falling asleep, but he was in marrow ecstasy.
I've found bones like that hidden in the couch. Maybe for later licks.
That looks fun and awesome. Love sticking my tongue in tight holes!
Dexter must be very popular with the bitches.
When you are exhausted but still want to joy.
Did you name him Dexter because it looks like he has glasses?
I can‚Äôt stop watching. üòÇ What a beautiful dog!
He rests his head on it? I guess that's cute-OH GOD!
This would be perfect for r/whatswrongwithyourdog
Put peanut butter in there and he will have a blast!
Almost had to take my dog to emergency surgery for one of these bones. She chewed a slot through the thing somehow then proceeded to get it caught around her lower jaw. The slot was thin, didn‚Äôt think it was an issue yet. We couldn‚Äôt get it off, she yanked it off with a Yelp when we said ‚Äúgoing to the vet‚Äù.
And they say dogs are man's best friend.
At first I was like "what thing?" Then the doggo was like *mlem" and I was like HAHA
r/animalsbeingderps
Rofl. What a riot.
Oh Dexter!
Um that bone scares me. My childhood dog got one of those caught around her bottom jaw over her tongue. We had to rush her to the vets late at night. The vet almost lost her on the table twice. We never gave her bones like that again. She ended up living to the ripe old age of 14. Sorry to be a downer. Just be careful with it. Dexter does look content.

7 months later and Dexter's master still hasn't taken the hint to get him a new marrow bone.
He looks just like me puppy just my is almost all brown and his name is bear üêª, he‚Äôs such a good boi
Kinky
This is the best mixture of funny and cute I‚Äôve ever seen
Kinda creepy and cute at the same time.
Some things never change
Julie, do the thing!!
What is up with all the reposted comments in this thread...
Found Gene Simmons's dog
I love it when my dog tongue punches my bone üëÖü¶¥
borderline nsfw
link to OG video please
Was he raised by hummingbirds?
I've never heard of a northern inuit, but I have a supposed pomsky and now I'm wondering if she might not be. She looks SO MUCH  like these dogs. http://imgur.com/gallery/kvsmeBZ
And she's equally as derpy as Dexter! How big is he?
That's awesome.  Careful with those bones though.  I had a dog get one stuck on it's bottom jaw.  Wasn't a good day for either of us.
Zhu Li! Do the thing!
I love this and hate this at the same time
He's so beautiful!!!
He knows the inside of the bone is the best part
Is this a 3/4 wolf? My mechanic has one that looks just like this big guy

Thanks. I'm saving this post for whenever I'm having a bad day ‚ù§Ô∏è
The thing that makes me happiest is that I still remember the old video
That‚Äôs so funny xx
I don't mean to be *THAT guy* but does anyone else see it?
What a great laugh I had at Dexter! He‚Äôs beautiful.
Careful. I saw a dog whoes tongue got stuck like that and swole up and was a problem.
Gotta be very careful though, I've seen a lot of dogs getting their  jaw stuck in those.
Your dog is freaking me out but I love it!
Get that good marrow
This is the first reddit post in a while that genuinely made me laugh out loud (more of a cackle, really). There's something very comedic about the timing.

Really cute dog, btw :)
/u/oriolous
He‚Äôs an innovator
So dorky, love it. He does it because there's so much flavor
You should refill it with some wet food, put it in the freezer over night and Dexter will be having fun for hours.
Dexter ready for Mrs. Dawg!
7months? give him a new bone ffs!
Why the fuck are people sexualizing the dog
This made me laugh the hardest, most genuine laugh I have laughed since my husband passed away 7 weeks ago. Thank you and Dexter SO SO much for this video. He is amazing.
Those bones have a dark side.

I had dog (springer spaniel/german shepherd mix) who enjoyed doing just that. One day, she really got her tongue into the bone as she chewed on it. Because the inside of the bone is slightly abrasive, her tongue began to swell and she couldn't remove it. The longer it went on, the worse it got as her tongue continued to swell and the bone caught behind her front canines. She was getting very antsy. We ended up at the veterinary emergency. They had to put her under to saw the bone off her tongue. Stressful and expensive.

This being said, he does look funny!
Dammit, I just got in trouble for browsing Reddit at work because I snorted when the dogs tongue came out XD
I have regretted buying these marrow bones 

The marrow only goes through a tiny a fraction of the bone.. it‚Äôs like those disappointing sandwich photos where the filling shows in the packaging but once you remove the packaging there‚Äôs little filling
That there is surface area maximization
Looks like an ant eater
Hey Mikey!
Wolf-elephant- pupper
IM CRYING
All the girls at doggy day care can‚Äôt wait to be kenneled with him
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve EVERRR seen
I laughed so hard at this üòÇ

This is wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing this.
Time to get him a new bone, must be manky  by now!
I must have one.
Oh! This made my day!
never seen this type of anteater before
Your dog is a comedian.
ooh we had a dog named dexter :D
He's lovely. Looks a bit like the sheriff of rottingham, but in a good way
He's the best bog
Mega Blep!
Dexter looks exactly like my sister's Northern Inuit, Koda! 
Beautiful pupper!!
Is he part wolf?
He longs for the *M A R R O W*
You don't see it coming
Was not expecting that
I don‚Äôt know what I expected, but I am wholesomely pleased.
Was feeling super depressed today. Now slightly less depressed. Thank you for this ü•∞
That‚Äôs where all the flavour is!
When your so wants some action but you had a rough day.

Keep an eye on his teeth :) My dog LOVES bones *too much*, so I had to switch to softer stuff bc he was grinding his teeth down.
[*Noot noot*](https://youtu.be/xsVjvqgAkcM)
Dexter is funny...
He looks like confused Scar from Lion King with that bone lol
I'm pretty sure he's aware this is adorable.
He looks so sleepy and content. I love him!
I went to check your profile to see a post from 7 months aho where you showed him first, but holy shit I was not expecting that
Hilarious
We all do childish things as an adult,still
That is some gorgeous dog
Take note gentlemen.
Ladies ;)
Bone blop? 

r/blop
He deserves all the bones
Lol why does he look so tired?
For a moment there I thought that was his mouth
oh my god hahahahahah is that a tamaskan??? or a husky? either way that is HILARIOUS
So funny
/runexpected
Lmfao
*blep*
Is it just me or his head is like a sphinx?
Aww he's part anteater.
Expand blep.
Right in the bone hole
That is highly disconcerting.

Good thing Dexter's a cutie to balance things out.
Hahahaha
r/anteaters
Please! Never grow up! üòò
I‚Äôm going through a rough time but this made me laugh. Dexter is a good boy
aw man goddamn
*dat marrow tho*

1.My buddy explained how to cook the soup bone to release the inside marrow(ice bath).

2.I remember a time when grocery meat cutters would give you bones for free.
Omg too funny
I needed this
The mlem of all mlems
That is just awesome.  Dogs have this way of just making us laugh by just being themselves.
I love when the cuteness is so strong it restarts my brain multiple times.
Thanks, I needed that
This made my day!
Can someone add yoshi sound effects to this?
Thats so funny. I have a husky named dexter aswel.

Omg my dog has a similar bone and does the same thing! What dinguses!
Where did you get this bone from! Would like to purchase one for my doggo
Keeping that bottom of the peanut butter jar skill in top form.
Please add peanut butter to replace the marrow.  Record and return here with clinical findings.
This is so funny!  Awww ü§ó
"Hey ladeeth. How'th it goin?"
My dog use to do the same thing
This is great! What a bud

God tier reddit post.
LOL thanks for this. Dogs are so full of goodness. We don‚Äôt deserve them. What a goofy good boy!
I love the little smile he does.
I thought that was part of his face and I was scared and confused
Haha holy shit!
I didn't know what I was expecting and when it happened I let out an unearthly giggle
How darling.
May help him feel secure
I knew what was going to happen, but I did not anticipate him doing that with his eyes and making it that much derpier
So wholesome.
He still has some growing to do if all he does is try to tongue the hole...
*Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again, and again*
Lol what that tongue do
Awwwwwwwah!!!  Hahahahaha omg I love him üòçü•∞
I wish mine was that cute. She likes to eat rocks.
Every hole‚Äôs a goal right Dexter buddy!
!remindme 3 months
ü§£
My 4 months old pitbulls name is also Dexter
That is a heck of a snoot right there.
Omg that‚Äôs adorable
That little smile at the four second mark is too cute.
What are the potential risks??
Nice hah!
This genuinely made me feel better after a lonely and exhausting week
he is a good dog
It's called a "flavor tunnel".
Have you noticed your dog buying huge amounts of plastic wrap, and taking lots of midnight boat trips?
Ju li do the thing!
Cursed gloryhole
I actually laughed
That grin
A hahahahaha what a good happy boy lol.
I love this!!! I need more things like this in my life!
So ADORABLE
Get him another bone. We got our dog a smoked steer leg bone. You will need to take it away from him after a while each day because they become addicted but he can can some marrow out of it at least.
That is a very good thing he does with the bone
I love this so much!
Please, just a tiny drop of marrow juice
Hahaha.... might sound crazy but Dexter reminds me of a hummingbird, licking nectar from a flower... Dexter is very handsome, with his unique, perfectly simetrical facial markings, long snout, and tall pointy ears (just like my Princess). And he retains his regal appearance and stature even with a hollowed out cow bone on his snout. I bet our dogs would be great, yet very silly friends. Thanks for the funny moments. ruffruff Dex!
Want to add a treat, fill it with peanut butter as a treat.my dogs get it on occasion as a special treat.
When my dog was younger she would stick her head in a bucket and run around
haha this is why i sub

Anyone know what race is the pup? He's fricking gorgeous, reminds me of wolves
When I was a kid I had a dog named Dexter. This is the first time I've seen another dog with the same name.
I thought Dexter is an ant-eater for a second lol
This is the thing that redeemed my Monday. Thank you.
I was not expecting that
So cute yet so gross
It‚Äôs good to excel at something.
I might just be a psycho but this made me uncomfortable
Ooh yeah baby lick that marrow hole
the sequel, yay!!
Nice
I want this with the Yoshi "mlem" sound effect
He looks like a wolf, he's beautiful
Damn look at those fukin ears
Is this some sort of solicitation?
So how'd you get a pet wolf?
You could fill it with peanut butter. He would love it.

That's some pretty good comedic timing
He‚Äôs tongue flossing his bone
"Heh, he's just sitting with his chin on the bone, not actually playing with it."

*Tongue slithers out from the middle of the bone*

##Oh
I was super depressed today and my friend sent me a link to this and it made me smile for the first time all day. Thank u dexter üíô
Only one who thought "what the fck is wrong with his snoot" at first?
Is that a wolf
This is exactly what I needed this morning after two hours of sleep. Should be a good day üòÅ
I needed that. Thank you for this post, I cried with laughter.
I hate and love this
Hee hee!! Thanks for the laugh, Dexter.
Can i get a link to the video to share it with all of my friend and family?
This just made my day, thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è

He knows what he likes.

Thanks, I just pissed myself.
Be proud
Wifes of the world are tagging this video #educational
And that‚Äôs why the ladies love him.....
I love him, he's so handsome!
Dexter..... a more perfect name does not exist
I want one of these dogs so bad! They are absolutely beautiful!
I feel awkward watching this
I was expecting him to put his tongue through the bone, but I didn't expect it to look so goofy. 

:D Man, this made my day.
The anteater tounge!
Tonight is the night.
Never change dexter
LOL at the silly pup
It looks like there is a finger coming out of the bone xD (in my opinion-)
Peanut butter was in that bone...guarantee it

What that tongue do? Lol
Why is this so funny, its the only stupidity I encourage
r/animalsbeingderps
My dog used to love the big cow bones like this.  Be mindful if they get big enough that he can get them stuck on his jaw; you'll want one of those like flexible saw things to slowly saw it off and to make sure he gets water.

How long is his tongue?
When she says what that mouth do üëÖ
He is SO CUTE OMG! Also, not to burst your bubble but we have removed a few of those bones from the bottom jaw of dogs üò≤

Schnoodle did a poem for the last one, here it is for you guys.

 

i am the dog - my bone i love

it comfort me, n soothe my soul

to stick my tongue right thru the hole
