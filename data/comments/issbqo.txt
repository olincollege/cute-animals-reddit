Cat: I see you got me a drink to go with my snack.
Such a smug little look too
My cat, when we used a spray bottle, would squint his eyes in anticipation so he wouldn’t get sprayed in the eyes. He didn’t learn anything but to anticipate getting sprayed.
By the way, not sure if anyone mentioned it, but that stir fry looks bomb
He won't fear that for very long, either.
Every meal you make, every bite you take, I'll be watching you
What, do you expect me to leave?  

No, Meowster Bond, I expect you to dine.
yea my cat does this too, but I gave him food once, so now he's convinced every little bit of food I eat is also his food. And he doesn't sit there like a cheeky little boy, he down right attacks the plate and leaves with whatever sticks to his mouth
DOOO ITTTT!!!

...

.....

......


Yeah, that's what I thought.
Mess with my bread, you get my lead!!!
Ok here are a few tips I give every new kitten owner:

1) Don't play with your hands. I know it's super fun, but you will teach your little fuzz ball that playing with your hands and feet is ok. This sets a precedent, and as they grow in their claws, you will regret it.

2) They thrive on routine. They do not speak our language, but all they want is to be part of the family. Every routine they have makes them feel safe and loved.

3) NEVER hit a cat. All this does is teach them to hate and fear you. 

4) Disciplining a cat is difficult, as literally most of their activities are based around getting your attention. This includes yelling and spraying with water. At best, they will have learnt that they get your attention with that behaviour, at worst they will learn not to do that behaviour when you are not around, and begin to hate and fear you.

You have essentially three methods at your disposal. First, simply ignore them. Second, pretend they have literally disappeared when they are in an area you don't want them. eg "hey where's mittens? Mittens? Mittens! Oh, there you are!" (When they come back to correct area). Third, autonomous defence systems. This is usually double sided tape. Cat jumps up and lands on tape, goes eeeewww this area is gross, and then jumps back down, satisfied that it sucks up there.

Edit: Ooo my first awards! Thank you!
I have found that the most effective way to stop a cat trying to steal your food, is to blow gently in their face when they try to stick their face in your plate of food.

Because cat to cat threatening always includes hissing in their opponent's face. ...So when we blow on the cat, we are communicating to them in cat language, telling them, this is my food! (wouldn't try this on a shy or timid cat though, but then a shy or timid cat is unlikely to try and steal food right off your plate)
Gonna get buried, but OP if you don’t want him on certain surfaces aka your tables and countertops put down some fine black pepper or cayenne pepper. They don’t like the feeling of it on their paws so they try licking it off. Mammals do not like hot things, humans being the extreme exception. They’ll start to associate certain surfaces with the “pain” so to speak and won’t go onto those places.
recipe
You feline lucky, punk?
"Wait so thats your food?"

"Always has been."
"Everything you bake, every bite you take, I'll be watching you. . ."
*looks down to post pic on reddit*

*looks up; food gone*
Damn I’d try to steal that food too. What is it?
🔫
As a longtime cat owner, I have to say, be *very firm* about this.  If they get away with it, they will try whenever they can, especially when you have guests.

I make it a point to avoid going to anyone's house who doesn't have proper control over their animals.  It's too stressful, and I'm supposed to be there to relax!
You don't have to do this if you train your animals not to have bad habits like getting on dining tables. Like come on.
we trained our cat not to do this by firmly redirecting him and them rewarding him with a treat.

so he’d have three chances to get off the table. if he got the message, he’d get a treat once we finished eating. if not, he was removed and put in the bedroom/bathroom until we were done. 

it’s all consistency and repetition. once he got the idea, we stepped down to two chances, one chance, and no chance. no chance, he got no treat if he didn’t behave.

he’s a really great cat and loves routine. most people and animals do. i strongly recommend this approach. no yelling, no hurting. just “if you can’t behave, you need to be removed from the situation. we’ll see you when we’re done eating.” that’s it.
JR, my late kitty, thought every drink put out was for him. The only way to keep him out of it was to put a lid on it. 

I got him when I was young and single. I shared my meals with him. I had trained him, without much thought, that anything I ate he could have too. Every meal I had to pay the kitty tax. ^(don't worry folks he never got anything that might hurt him)
Beautiful kitty. Jackson Galaxy does say that spraying water doesn’t get the cat to learn the lesson, just makes them scared of you. Put this sweetie in another room when you’re eating.
While some of the comments are hilarious I'm concerned a lot of you should not own cats. Spray pepper, lemon and vinegar in your cats eyes spray that in your eyes. Let alone studies show that spraying a cat with just water they will disassociate with you because they will only see you as hurt. Cats are not dogs they do not forgive.
“*do it. You wont*”
OP, could you drop the recipe for the food. That looks good.

Edit: Foot -> Food
*MISSION BEGINS IN 10 SECONDS*
The person I live with got a couple kittens recently and one of them is really shy. Unless you have food. I was carving up some chicken and the little just jumped right up and stuck her head in it, no fear. The other kitten is pretty chill, it just wants to watch what I'm doing and sniff everything, never has tried to steal food while I'm cooking.
Yeah, on the tables gonna be a no from me dawg...
That one’s got spunk for sure! Gotta love it. I bet she’s/he’s a hoot, even though it can be challenging at times.

Edit: I meant to add, put foil on your table, after your kitty “experiences” it once, she’s likely to not return to the table for a lifetime. Did this with kitchen counters, they haven’t touched a counter in 6 1/2 years.
While I was raising my cats, both girls (if it matters) every time I was correcting their behavior, I would hiss. At just under 2 years old now, a hissing noise will actually get them to stop an act. My thought was that's how other cats communicate, so why not do the same.
Or you know... try and train your cat...
Discipline. Not fear. And you're doing it all wrong, get that fucker of the table.
It’s so old school but every spoiled rotten very loved cat I have ever had never got on a single counter after I did as my gran taught me. 

Save a paper towel tube and wait for it to jump up... swat near it on the counter or on its bottom just lightly. 

Let me be clear your not trying to hurt it or swat it. 
The noise freaks them out big time. The noise is what you are going for. I have had tons of cats and I would never hurt any fur baby at all. 

Something about that noise in particular spoils it for them so bad and I have never had to do it more than once. 

My cats have never feared me and visit all surfaces including the tall backs of my couch, foot stools, even chairs next to tables and counters... but they never try the table tops or counters again.
(Amused) "Foolish Mortal, you think that pathetic thing will stop me?"
We got two kittens right when lockdown started for us in mid-March, and he has zero fear either.

This cat will follow a vacuum cleaner around the house.  Despite his complaints we’re not letting him roam free outside, because we know that he’ll just run into the mouth of a coyote without hesitation.
Get away from the food and I mean meow.
I'm just imagining the cat making a headcrab sound as it pounces onto the food lol.
All my cat wants to do is sniff it & then she goes away (mostly). If she doesn't, I cut her off a piece of whichever she likes. Cats aren't dogs, they don't like most foods, they're just curious as to what it is
speaking of said meal... you're eating fried rice with a spoon???
Ahh, the FART (Feline Attitude Readjustment Tool). We had an orange one for dealing with our cat at my old place.
Kitty: I see you has food. I also like food and I has no hooman food. I can has food?
Staged, your place is too tidy and clean for the house of a cat lady.
tell  me about your lunch, it looks good. (full points to your kitty for that face)
"so anyways, I started blasting..."
Enjoy it while it’s still cute 😂
My foster kitten doesn't even fear water. I can full on spray him with a spray bottle and he will not flinch.
Awesome! I tried using a spray bottle on my pup when he got too close or somewhere he was not supposed to be, but he enjoyed trying to eat the mist out of the air, so...
My ballsy old boy captain Jack was like this too 😅 literally the only way I got him to mostly stop was feed him first at 5 everyday (of course he would break plant pots, zoom around the house and cause chaos from 3 onwards until he got it..) then reliability went out to do his business at half 6-7 and I could eat in peace!
The centerpiece of our dining room table is a squirt bottle.
Kitty: “Wait, it’s not our food?”

Human: “never has been.”
🐱🔫
Some advice a fellow cat owner. They're way smarter than you think, so spraying them with water to fix bad habits rarely works.
That stir fry looks good right meow
Shes not even looking at the pistol.
Seems u have the old “mexican standoff”, i hope u draw first every time, or meals will be lost
To be fair to the kitten that shrimp fried rice looks dope
Can i use this as a meme format?
That's some weird looking cereal.
Cute now, but not when she's 10.  From one who's been there, figure out a way to stop this now.  May have to just lock her up.
An old cartoon I saw yearsss ago had a guy tell his cat he will get the squirt gun if he doesn’t calm down. The next panel is the cat with snorkel mask on.
I'm confused by the table. There's a fiberous mat under the glass, but the glass extends out further than the mat and seems to be hanging over the edge of the supports for the table? The cat is on what appears to be a laptop?

This whole table thing has me bewildered
The first time I ever sprayed my cat hurley (6 M) with a water bottle I got him directly in the eye!!!! He has had the upper hand ever since. He will always squint that eye at me anytime I get upset over something to show me he still remembers.
The lunch looks nice
Long ago the four nations lived in harmony. That all changed when the fi-OH GOD MITTENS GET AWAY FROM MY DINNER
Yo is that shrimp fried rice or sumn bc that shit looks good
Make sure no one sees you holding the gun, they might call the cops and you’ll end up dead upon their arrival😬
Because of the cat you have to use a spoon instead of proper chopsticks?!?!  That savage!
This is the best meme template I have ever seen.
Why would you let the cat up on your table?
This reminds me of when both my boys were kittens, if I was eating an apple I’d have to hold it aloft between bites because they were obsessed with smelling it and would climb me to get at it!
My new kitten loves water, we tried to spray her whenever she was on a table, and now it doesn't phase her that she gets soaked.
Need to hold it sideways for street cred.
She’s literally making the >:3 face
That isn’t how you ate every meal until now? Get your priorities straight.
That cat walks in its own shit and is now walking its shit paws across the table you eat your food at.

Please don't touch the table then your face and please get the cat off the table.
🔫
What are you eating? Looks really good.
I mean I'd try to steal some too, that looks damn good.
Did you use a colander when making your egg fried rice?
She's looking at you like spray me.. I dare you.
She can stare down the barrel of a gun and smile. I don't think you have a cat.
“Do what you must, for I have already won”
Keep the change, ya filthy animal.
how about, when he jumps on the table, you put him on the floor...

Do that whenever you're eating, and they'll learn...

You can teach cats good behavior...
Tables are for glasses, not asses! The cat has got to go.
Say meow again. Say meow again, I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker, say meow one more Goddamn time!
Cat live matters.
"Our meals"
I see you like to eat of Pyrex too.
‘Do it. I dare you.’
With food that looks that good you'll need a water gun for me too
I'm cracking up.... she is  serious kitty.  Serious about getting yours....... don't turn our back!
thanks for the a great idea.
That is so freaking cute.    

Who usually wins?
I know this pain, we got a cute ginger kitten for our older cat to keep him company.

She literally will steal pizza from the box while you smack her...... she has no fear when it comes to food.....
Arresting this r/IllegallySmolCats
I try not to say the N word.  My dog is attentive and sensitive.  I dont want to yell it at the cat when hes chewing on a bone or relaxing.

I'll make up a cat word that the dog isnt familiar with.

Dog also knows stop it, down, HEY, ..  I'll work on it.
Sorry but whatchu eating though coz that looks amazing!

Sincerely, not your cat I promise I'm just hungry😂
Damn that meal looks good
Peace was never an option.
[My dumb cat was like this](https://i.imgur.com/2s0fWvw.jpg).  Started with water, moved to half water/half vinegar, all the way to full vinegar.  He didn't care one bit.  He would  smell burning candles and singe off his whiskers.  HIs would open the freezer door because he was so massive he could force it open wtih his body somehow.  I had to use bungee cords to keep it shut.  He also made me keep my gallon jug of cooking oil in the fridge because he would open cabinets and chew on the bottle to lick the dripping oil.

I lost [him & his sister](https://i.imgur.com/pQ1G3uo.jpg) in a house fire last year, and wish I had one more day with them both.
[https://i.imgur.com/pGX3RMC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/pGX3RMC.jpg)
I want your shrimp fried rice recipe!
Looks like he doesnt even fear that thing ur holding lol
Kitten: Wait, all that food is just for you?

OP: Always has been
How will that help you if the cat has no fear
This brings back memories lol
[You mean it was yours all along?](https://imgur.com/gallery/9ZVScZX)
Kitten: "how much water is in that thing? How good is your aim?"
Looking at you like "I dare you."
I once had a kitten that jumped on the counter. A friend suggested that I use double sided tape as a deterrent.....it didn’t work....the cat has been stuck on the counter for 3 days now.
Gross... Off the food surface.
A spray bottle set to mist works a treat. They hate the mist setting.
"Puny human..." -That smirk.
I got an 11 year old cat who still does this. Especially when I'm eating chicken or salmon!
Or just take em off the table so you don’t get toxoplasmosis
"I fear no ONE"
“You have to sleep sometime my friend, and when you do I’ll strike.”
You'd have to spray me too, that meal looks amazing!
Ah yes, the Feline Behavior Modification Device.  We have a few of those.  Our two cats need only hear the clatter of the plastic and they behave.
Beware of the cat.
Doom: Eternal
I have to do this because my puppy has no shame. I use a spray bottle, but you make me think a squirt gun is a better investment.
Ooh what are you having?
Shrimp fried rice? Protec.
Kitten doesn’t give a fuck all
Sounds like my dog
Now I want panda.
No fear, except for water.
In dutch we have the word 'kattenkwaad' which is directly translated to 'catevil' which is perfectly described in this cats look haha
You must fight!
This is how I feel I should prepare myself for every meal with my now standing 8 month old son 😂
Do it hooman
It’s those teen and young adult years w kittens when they’re at their worst.
I can only imagine your hand is trembling fear
I had one like that. He lived in the dog cage during meals
"Why do you have your Walther pointed at my testicles?"

"Because you've just given yourself away, captain. You're no more German than that scotch."
Whatcha eatin?
Straight up coyote piss usually works
Once had a tiny little rescue kitten who brazenly stole a chicken wing (just fried, not sauced) from my plate and successfully held my entire family off with her claws and fangs for at least 3 minutes while we all tried to get it away from her. We won the battle in the end but it was close and some of us are scarred for life.
That meal looks dank af.
We have a dedicated nerf gun for our cat... 100% get it!
I cant stop laughing. Adorable and eeeeeevil
One (1) fear--squirt gun (for now)
I just want to know more about that shrimp fried rice. Looks good! was it?
This is me except my cat is 15...the elderly dgaf.
Did it work? By the smug look... I feel like it may not have worked for long
Duh, he can see your food through the clear bowl.  Eat clear food!
You know I keep that damn thang on me
After 16 years our cat has no f*cks left to give and we just get angry looks from her as she continues whatever she is doing while getting hit with water.
Reach for the skkkkkkkkyyyyyyyyyyyy
Ahh yes. The plastic guard tower. 
Fearless kittens are double-edged sword. You admire their tenacity and adventurous spirit, but your head explodes when you just want to eat a meal or sweep the floor.
Out here doing Gods work.
But does that work, though? My boyfriend's sister's cat didn't care, she'd steal your pizza slice as you drenched her.
Do it.
Can't blame the cat the food looks delish
What are you eating! That looks good
Ah, a normal American meal!
I know them feels.
I have a tortie who is relentless, I just put her in the bathroom while I eat and she “gets it” at first but she seems to forget the lesson a few days later.
I had this issue, then went vegan. Kitty not interested anymore!
I occasionally "joke" that I need to do yoga whenever I eat a two-handed sandwich, because my feet end up becoming the cat deterrents.
I can relate all to well.... I've had to drench my kitten before because he just kept comin. There was no backing down from the spray bottle that day.
Pssssh don't front. You know you share.
If they are anything like my sassy ginger, they will just adapt to the water and come closer to swat at the squirt gun.
That’d be funny for about 3 meals and then after that I’d start rethinking owning a cat.
Is that shrimp fried rice?? damn that looks good
*I dare you*
"Keep your booger hook off the bang switch, Karen!  Also, meow"
We were out having dinner this weekend and some local stray kitties have taken a liking to the restaurant. We had our little dog with us and she had her blanket with some of her biscuits on it and her water. 

The cats came for us, one little kitten in particular. My little old girl is so scared of anything so was cowering under my SO's chair. We had to resort to squirting water to keep him away, they really are relentless
SAME. Except they love water.
This is the BEST ever! Thank you!
your meal seems healthy
Ah yes, get ready to never have a clean surface ever again lol
Give it time, you'll find their weakness.
It's all fun and games until the cat pulls out a gun too.
Is that shrimp fried rice?
Look lady; that's a 5 day suspension and I've sent the cops to do a welfare check.
I have one of those too!! I’ve never met a cat who is so interested in people food. He tries to eat everything
that squirt gun looks exactly like the emoji
That fried rice looks bomb.
Put vinegar in it and see.
Hilarious and cute ❤️
I just got a kitten as well, same thing
They turned the emoji gun into a real thing lmao 🔫
This is the mood of having a food motivated cat hahahaha.
Peace was never an option
I’m just imagining you eating with your left hand while the spoon is like that
Sometimes  when cats are food  aggressive  they have thyroid  problems.  Mine  was extremely  aggressive,  took her to the vet and  now  she  gets 2 crushed up pills  a day in wet food  and  aggression  is gone. Just a thought.
My cat was like that cause she had slight food aggression from being in a big litter.
We have an air spray canister in our dining area for just this.
I feel your pain.
You're just a big ole pushover admit it
One fear
Get some citrus spray!
Lol that's how I have to eat my yogurt
you dare oppose me mortal
If this was already asked I’m sorry, but that looks bomb what are you eating? Does it have a name?
Omg I’m in love 😍
She’s looking at you like, “I dare you”. That’s the same look my kitten makes when he’s about to do it anyway
Try me!
We have a deaf cat and she knows no fear. Scolding does nothing as she cant tell we’re mad. Even roughly pushing her away makes her think its a game. 🤣😂
With fried rice like that, can you blame the little guy?
Had to do the same thing with my Black Bear Ivan. I’d have to keep him at bay with my Small Caliber Hand Gun. Enough to keep him away without hurting him. Sadly, my neighbor didn’t own a Small Caliber Hand Gun, and was eaten by Ivan when he was Bearsitting him. We are currently hiding in the mountains of Russia
I love it. My small cat eats cucumber, croutons and animal crackers if you give him a chance to steal it from you
Welcome to the life of owning cats! This sums up my life lol
Lol dang just tell him to get off the table and put him on the floor , you could try this ,when you eat , get some cat nip and sprinkle a bunch  the floor , that a way he will eat and roll in the cat nip why you are eating , put cat toys  like  mouse in the cat nip rub  cat nip on mouse real good, try that it mite help ,
Our siamese kitten has no fear either. Just sticks his little nose in everything. When our tabby was a kitten, he once quicly jumped onto our coffee table and stuck his nose in my gfs coffee cup. He was so desperate to smell it, that he didn't take any precaution. As it was still piping hot, he learned a valuable lesson.... for a month anyway...
Might have too try with my rabid kids 🥰🥰
Canned air for cleaning you computer is effective too.
Try using those canned air dusters, my cat doesn't give a shit about being sprayed with water but he's straight up ears back and hissing if I even point the air can at him.
D:
This could be a meme format
Forgrt the kitten......that food looks good😋 lol jk jk kitten is cute
She is so beautiful, though.
that cat is cute i wish i had rewards to give you
Put blue painters tape on the table sticky side up. It will release easy enough but they hate it. That's how I stopped mine from hopping up on my couch. Just took a few weeks.
If she keeps messing with you run her tail under tge water and get it good and wet.
Peace was never an option
The kitten's face says "Do it, you won't"
ah I needed this.
I have 1 fear... ONLY 1 and it is..... Emojis
"I fear no man, but that thing... It scares me."
Damn. Ur lunch do be lookin fine
Nobody:

The cat: :3
Feed your brother. Does he not hunger as you do?
Human will share he will.
I taught my cat and dog “bedroom”...mom is going to eat. Time for treats! I would never want to eat like this and it’s so unnecessary.
That’s the look of a cat who knows he’s about to get that food.
Do ya feel lucky, Puss?
I have the exact same squirt gun for my puppy lol
....*worth it*
They call that a table for one.
Hold the water gun in your left hand while you eat with one eye open
that device is like the opposite of pspsps
Every meal
When my old cat was a kitten, we tried using spray bottle to stop him clawing the screen door. He didn’t care and he would close his eyes and start licking his tongue out to drink the water anyway!  

My young kitten is even smarter and chewed up the bottom of the hard plastic spray bottle so the water leaked out. Can’t get sprayed if there’s no water in it.
My kitten jumps four paws into whatever bowl I’m eating out of. She times it just right so I can’t jerk away. 

My cereal, my ice cream, my stir fry, anything. Bowl = kitten jump. And if there’s a moving spoon or fork to chase along with it... oh god
Gotta be strapped at all times now
Hahahaha, I completely understand fellow new-kitten parent.

For a few days I had to eat standing up in my kitchen until the little bastard started climbing up my leg. 

He understands now what food is his, and what food is mine. He didn't like it when I pretended to eat his food.
I feel for you. My new puppy has a massive food drive but the one thing she fears above all else is the spray bottle.
Same!! I just got a tiny little girl... And she does not give a damn! You can spray her three times and she'll just stand there!
You better stay persistent with that squirt gun and teach that cat some manners. Other the cat owns you or you own the cat. You choose.
Every meal meow
“AMMO IS CHEAP”
This made me literally LOL.
Ngl tho that meal looks smack asf tho what is it
Gosh, cutest little burglar ever, eh?
Huh, on mine water doesn't even work... I'm eating all my meals with white vinegar bottle spray. He hates that shit.
Back the fluck up kitty!
I never thought of a water pistol but need it now! I use the dollar store spray water bottles for my dogs. With Bernie all he has to do is see it and he quits barking at me for food. He still stares, but is quiet lol.
Cats are the best.
Kitten: Wait? This is your dinner?

Human: Always has been.
We got a water gun to spray my cat if she scratches the couch but now she just doesn't give a shit if we spray her
Uncle Roger fried rice?
Sitting squarely
Egg in rice is such a good idea.
“I’ll make a another meal with you”
Looks like my old cat: "Jack the Ripper"
If you say NO! When you blast them with the squirt bottle they eventually learn to fear the “no” rather than the bottle. They are cats though so the bottle needs to come back out sometimes. We like the spray bottles someone might use to wet their hair or something
I can’t even get out of my own bedroom without being terrorized and tripped every step
quite literally,

🐈🔫
As somebody who has been living with this same cat for about 6 months now, it does not get better and your cat will not learn. I would also suggest putting baby locks on your trash can.
Jambalaya with shromp. Always a great dish. No wonder you need to protect it
Eyes show no fear
I don't get the concept. Why even have a cat if you're not going to feed it veggy fried rice?
HAHA, cute. Buy the look on the cats face you can tell she/he is plotting their next move.
He's on top of the glass table, he should be getting water gunned already.
Man, you gotta get him off the table first! Lol
Edit: He is so cute though
i wont hesitate, bitch!
Kitten: You can wet me only once, but that food will be mine.
Looks just like my cat, and mine does the same shit.
The cat is looking at her like "yeah right Karen, you won't pull the trigger"
Oh shit, tf did you make, looks goooood af, mix it with sause and fuck
Is this your food? 

Always has been
Looks fire tho, is that shrimp fried rice?
Hahaha!
I have too many electronics and papers in my house to use squirt guns. I use Nerf. Longer range, more accurate, less collateral damage.
I dare you.
LOL! We need this for our cat, too!! She’s fine when we’re eating homemade food, but takeout makes her go NUTS!
I love that kitty. I had one that I had to eat with my arm encircling my plate with my head directly over it while I growled.
😂😂😂
This has meme potential, what should I caption it?
Or you could put a spoonful on a plate for her and eat together, like you’re a real family😉
There are certain foods I only dare eat when my dog is out of the house.
It's like a Tarentino movie.
Looks good. What’d you make?
That'll be dinnertime WAP
It's all people food 

always has been
Put some on the edge with extra spice
Aw, c'mon! We need to see a video of the watergun in action 🔫
A SQUIRT GUN. Genius. I’ve been using a spray bottle but it makes too much mess and it’s so dissipated my cat can’t really feel it. He just gets a smug look like your cat and continues to hassle me. I feel your pain. Your baby is gorgeous!
I think you mean, that’s how you have to eat every meow now.
the nxt giorno
# PAWS WHERE I CAN SEE EM
🤣🤣🤣
Wah give him a shrimp
I’m the captain now
 Nice fried rice
Hahaahahaha
Look at the spite in his face, like saying "I ate your food once and I WILL DO IT AGAIN"
Well kitten isn't the only one that wants a bite of that meal  ( °꒳° )
Your school just swatted your house for showing off your gun to the class.  You're so grounded.
I think my cat and your cat are spirit animals. Unfortunately, my cat loves the spray gun. I need help
My lil girl is the same way. Even with the cone of shame she didn't have any fucks to give. Until I actually sprayed.
Dude! We rescued a little kitten who will try non-stop to get to your plate when you’re eating. It’s to the point that I sometimes have to go behind a closed door to enjoy my meals.
Compressed air works great, too. Quick puff in their general direction and they tend to skitter away.
one fear
Ew cats stand inside of their littler boxes to go to the bathroom, get her off of the dining room table lol
If you put some drops of tea tree oil around the furniture that is forbidden they won’t get on it (according to my MIL)
Please post a video
Sooner or later you guard will be down, mr Bond. And your meal shall be mine.
What do you do to piss of Bastet?
I had a kitten like that. 
He’s an 18 pound cat now. 
Only advice I can give you; 
Get a bigger squirt gun, it never ends. 
 But they are so darn cute, can’t help but love them.
I had a cat that did things all the time that were not okay with me, but not eating my food. Just coming in with live birds and lizards. We were on the 3rd floor so I’m impressed. Borrowed the water gun from the little girl I nannied. Looks like I’ll be doing that again for the three cats I have now who run off with my quesadilla and smack my water over.

Edit: they’ve also ripped my curtains out of the wall and climbed up my dresses, tearing them up. I wanted a super soaker.
🔫🔫🔫
I tried this with one of my cats. He learned to attack the squirt gun.
There's a meme in here somewhere; I'm just not cleaver enough to think of it.
You should be fine as long as you don’t have a zoom call with school classes
I had a kitten who had no fears. I thought it was cute and let her even eat from my mouth. 15 years of this isn't fucking cute. This is how I always eat.
On the table, on your iPad, waiting to be on top of your food.

Cats, man.
MY KITTENS ARE VULTURES PLS I WANT TO EAT IN PEACE
My cats got used to regular squirt guns, so I had to invest in a super soaker. All I had to do was pump it 1 time after they figured out it really a lot of water.
I got two male kittens in June. They’re 5 months old now. Steph is a master at getting into stuff, super agile, extremely interested in food, he jumps in my plate to get it. The other is not as skilled or precise at jumping but man... he can knock shit over very well and get what he wants.
Is that the emoji_irl? 🔫
I can relate!
“Back off or the plant gets it”
That’s a failure to train your cat that your table is a no-go zone. The fact he’s up there at all is worthy to get sprayed. 
I swear people should NOT be okay with your cats paws (that walk through it’s shit box) on any surface where you food is eaten or prepared...
Spraying water doesn't teach them anything, so maybe try something else. Can't recommend Jackson Galaxy enough.
I have to put my little rascal in the bathroom and close the door otherwise I can't prep or have a meal in peace.
If she has no fear then that gun is useless! Kitty, attack!
Oh he’s sus af I’m voting him
If I even touch the spray bottle, my cats will bolt.
How did you 3D print an emoji?
This is my exact situation right now. Replace the water gun with a spray bottle though. Sometimes that doesn't even work. He'll just squint his eyes and shake any wetness off his head.
My guy used to get in the fireplace way more than I liked. He’d screw around with the chain-mesh curtains in front of it (which was really annoying) and then just chill in there. I got a squirt bottle so I could snipe him from across the room when he tried it. It didn’t even come close to deterring him. One time, he got in there *while* I was squirting him, and just sat there staring at me as I squirted him over and over for like 20 seconds straight. I had to yank him out and dry him off with a towel because he was soaked. Asshole
What if he makes one move
I just got my first cat since I was a kid a few months ago.  After reading this thread, I've realized that I'm just going to have to come to accept that my cat is an asshole half the day and my best friend the other half.
Someone got the ray gun from the mystery box.
Mine thinks it's a game and enjoys getting wet.
I used a spray bottle (of water) on a cat and she kind of got used to it. Once I aimed it at her and she squinted as she stood her ground. Funniest thing.
Bold little kitty. Make the first move, I dare you
Try it, I will end you human!
His face says it all “you think that will be enough?” “Ultra instinct theme begins”
If you want to eat in peace pull out the vacuum cleaner and turn it on.   Maybe some headphones also because its sort of noisy.
this is hilarious
Be careful!!! When I got my kitten, I wanted her to stop walking across my pillow to get to my water cup on the nightstand. One morning as she stepped over my head, I reached for the spray fun on the nightstand and got her point blank between the eyes and rolled back over to go to sleep. A moment later, I felt a warm sensation on my feet, and realized that my cat was peeing on me. That was the last time I used the spray gun! 😂
Hi fellow ukulele player!
So has no fear except water pistol.
THEY SHALL KNOW NO FEAR!!
Hahaha that bowl and any food you eat is just an appetiser - you are the main course you can see it in its eyes...
“I wish a muthalover would try.”-cat
Didn't even read the title at first. Immediately saw the gun, cat, food and knew where this is going. My kitten is almost 6 monst old. He does the same shit.
Two pieces of unsolicited advice!

1) don’t give your cat anything you won’t always want to feed him. My cat only gets tuna and cheez-its(don’t ask) and when ever he so much as hears the packaging rustle he goes nuts and won’t leave me alone until he gets some. 

2) for a cat that won’t listen, or may even be aggressive to get food from you, I recommend a pickle jar full of loose change to shake at him when he is being a little shit
He's so smug about it, too.
Every meal mnow
🔫
We have four. I don't feed them people food but the other two people do. One cat will sit for a hour waiting for a Bojangles french fry.
Just eat underwater
I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six squirts or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 water pistol, the most powerful squirt gun in the world (as far as you know), and would get you a little wet, you've got to ask yourself one question: "Do I feel lucky?" Well, do ya, cat?
At least he's getting sprayed with the cool freshness of Evian spring water
Can you make me some of that fried rice next time?
Meme template.
So... what your saying is....he in fact, DOES have ONE fear 😂
Come at me, bruh
It's so hard to resist them. They're like tiny conartists of cuteness.
i feel like this picture has great meme template potential...
have mercy on him
My dogs would have me load the water gun with coconut water because they like it. BUT ONLY CHILLED.
What were you eating? Looks like something I would like
I noticed cats have traits that that are born with. I would assume this cat trait is being hungry and eating. I use to own a cat that had that treat since it was a kitten and we called her fatty.
So that is how you have to eat every meal meow?
Have you tried clapping in her face?
Can you share the recipe?
Things seem pretty tense over there.
“No Kitty this is my stir fry!” - cartman voice
Hey you learned how to prison dine all on your own, usually you gotta rob a bank to cover the admission.
I have a beagle/ hound mix pup and it’s basically the same. The dogs with the best noses want the best smelling food
I thought you had crunch berries in your fried rice...
"I toucha the shrimp-fried-rice?"
Wait, it's all kittens?
Thought those were Lucky Charms, but now I think it's fried rice
That moment cat was just joking, but she wasn't even kitten around..
It's all fun and games until the cat starts chugging down the water and still walking towards you
Strapped with the Drizzly
Dogs have owners and cats have staff
Pull the trigger before it thinks it is allowed on tables.
Do it without even looking at her, she won't blame you so much.
You have a very long road ahead of you. 8 years later for me and I have put a baby latch on the fridge door.
Draw!
No kitten would fear water bullets. HAHAHA
Love the emoji water gun
Accurate illustration of cat ownership
He has the exact naughty look on his face my kitten gets!!
Your first mistake is letting him on the table.
Nice
I'd probably attack that dope ass lookin shrimp fried rice too! Seems more like the kitten just wants that high end cuisine lifestyle you get to enjoy!
Timeouts work way better than water btw, less resentment
We have one just like it. We started calling him Bad Cat. It’s the only name that stuck. Now we have a Mr. BC running our house.
“challenge accepted”
Don’t let him on the table at all. Don’t want to get him in the habit of thinking it’s ok to be up there.
That’s the emoji gun lol 🔫
"No, kitty, this is *my* pot pie!"
My kitten is the same way, all she does is squint and walk very slowly towards my food
My cat isn't allowed on the table. 

Of course, that means the second we leave he's all over it
The John Wick of Cats
When they stop fearing the water, you are in trouble!  Mine scatter when I get the spray bottle that has water.
“Wait that’s YOUR food?”

“Always has been”
food looks so good tbh
Where did you get my emoji gun irl
At this moment....
She is plotting your demise.
Gotta love em.
If he doesn't have fear, then doing that won't stop him.
Dude I’d be crawling all over my lover for a bite too!
Awww until it’s Ughhh
What you gon do if it misfires?
I found that most cats really hate when I blow in their face. Just in case your water gun goes empty.
Honestly, you should add a (VERY small!!!!) portion of white vinegar to the water you're spraying with. Even just the littlest bit of burn will work way better for training. It seems cruel but is utterly harmless when diluted. (I'm talking less than 1::8 ratio white vinegar::water.)
You’re acting real sus
How does that glass tabletop stay there?
I was gonna give advice but is that shrimp fried rice?
Hey, hot tip. I bought a Vick's menthol inhaler because I had some stuffy nose issues and turns out it's a fantastic cat repellent. You just take the cap off and shove it in their face where they can smell it and they will run away and leave you alone. Might take a few times of coming back at first but now when my kitten sees me even grab it he backs off. They hate the smell of minty stuff.
it's your move partner feeling lucky?
Fucking lol! We got two kittens and we have to do the exact same thing. The little savages are very clever too and still am age to steal food the second you look away.
I have a bird who’s the same way, except she’s afraid of wooden spoons so I always have to keep one nearby to scare her away. And I have to be vigilant too, this birdie will literally divebomb straight into my plate and grab a bite.
Cat: Wait, it is YOUR meal?

Human: Always has been 🔫
What's the dish?
At one point, I had 3 kittens and 2 adult cats...


I feel this
Squirt guns don't work. They only teach the cat to either:

Avoid the squirt gun

Avoid doing it when you're around

It doesn't actually reinforce much other than fear and trepidation. I would suggest trying other methods.
We have squirt bottle stations too
It's all cat food??

Always has been.
You got the water cannon
I like your food too...
What’s that meal
Ha ha clearly saying bring it puny human lol
Gotta get me one of those
I don’t get how having to literally spray your cat so you can eat is cute
You can keep them off counters and coffee tables without a gun. Just have to consistently shoo them off. They will learn. I have two cats and they keep off my counters, at least while I’m home. When I leave it’s a different story.
You’re not actually pointing the squirt gun at her in the photo. What will she do if it is pointed directly at her, I wonder...
I had to zoom-in on your food, because for a moment there, just a moment, it looked like you mixed Rice Crispies with Capt Crunch.
You should call him Greedo.
Stand off!!
I mean what did you expect trying to eat a big ass bowl of [Friskies Indoor Delights](https://petbangla.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/product-image-detail-indoor-delights_2.jpg) right in front of her?
I feel this.
Her face says, "Soon."
That Jambalaya looks really good.
So what is that you are having?
What a stinker
I need one of those for Liesel
Finally, someone who understands.

Currently huddled over my plate with spray bottle at the ready.
Those vegetables are raw fam
I feel like that cat's priming to become water-resistant.
Stay strapped
Take the gun, leave the fried rice
"Looks here like we got ourselves a mexican standoff"

-Cat maybe
The water has no effect on me Karen.
“Pffft. Your toy gun wont stop me” - Kitty probably
I have one of those. No boundaries.
You can see the calculations going on in his head on how he might possibly get past your deterrent to reach his prize.
If kitty's on the table and you ain't blastin', you've already lost the long game
It's high noon...
Awww how old is she? I’m looking to get a pair of kittens soon.
https://youtu.be/YyWlU3MdYcY
Whatever you at6e eating...looks amazing!! I DON'T blame her!!
That’s bowl of rice looks fyeeeeeee
When training it really does help when you put food down for kitty when you start eating aswell. At least in my experience.
G U N
Your fault for adding shrimp:)
This won't change. Butters is now 2 years old, and still bold as hell.

He'll even sit there and stare into the water as it sprays him, and just wait for you to finish.

He's special.
Definitely trying to figure a way around this new development.
This reminds me of the Cantina scene with Greedo...
LOL nice one
Hehehe may cat did the same shit when i got a spray bottle she does not give a fuck
"I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me!"
I didn’t know you could buy the squirt gun emoji in real life, sweet!
Read this as "this is how I have to eat my cereal now." Did a double take when I saw the bowl of stir fry cereal.
I did the same
First off- why is the cat allowed on the counter/table?  No way at our house.
My brother did this with a kitten many years ago.

The kitten just learned to hate people. Great job.
Looks like some good fried rice
This picture is My reddit handle in a nutshell. Gold me someone
I’m sure you will have to upgrade to a larger caliber like a super soaker or such
Lolol fuck cats 🖕🏻😂🖕🏻
But then they don’t fear the squirt gun also...
Just wait until they learn to not fear the spray bottle and instead beg you to break it out all the time so they can drink from it. I swear to god, my cat is insane.
So cute ! Maybe try a treat dispensing toy or a good puzzle to help him learn what food is his and to keep him occupied longer at meal times.
you know I keep that thang on me
Kitty go and get yo ‘ self some shrimp!
You got that emoji looking gun
My kitten is the same. Maybe I should try that...
When I was a kid we had a house cat. Mama had house cat rules. I never saw that cat ever on any furniture. Certainly not the kitchen table. I never saw mama hit the cat. It was her voice we all harkened to.
SAME AND SAME ONLY MINE IS A SQUIRT BOTTLE.
I get wet but iz worth it!
Blink
If that ain't the most relatable thing
Yeah, I probably wouldn’t let it in the table in the first place.
I have a cat like that, just licks the water off. Compressed air, the kind you use for blowing dust out of electronics, that's about the only thing she reacts to (and it's just the noise, the air never gets that close to her).
Instead of a water gun get a real gun she/he will start to fear you when you eat
My suggestion is prep her food before you sit down creating routine then after dinner play time
