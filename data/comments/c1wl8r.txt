That kitten is right at the age when they stop being clumsy and really test their speed a lot. And their braking on sheets of paper ability üôÄ
Please tell me Jim is still brining his classes to his house for garlic bread and poetry. He was my favorite professor and one of my favorite people. Everytime I think my aspirations are getting too big I ground myself by thinking that I would be happier as a Jim E. than as a famous author. 

If you see him soon please let him know Tristan from class of 2015 says hello and that I'm eternally grateful for the influence he had over me.
And now you have to take more classes from this professor!! 

That's awesome! I would have loved to be in a class with a kitten. This really speaks a lot about your professor. 

And by the way, it looks like you stole my cat!!
Its my uh... emotional support cat! He helps me focus on important things like cats and kittens
What a great professor!
Aww I felt bad for the boy at the end when the kitty doesn‚Äôt go his way ( at least in the video)
What a fun fun way to relax! I think there should be service animals at school of all levels to relieve stress ‚ù§Ô∏è
love how pumped that guys was as he realized he was about to get this kitten up in his spot
Classroom kitten, learning rhyme

Course is now purretry time

No more sonnets, meter, prose

Only tiny, pink bean toes
I love the setup of this classroom. It gives the vibes of a meeting where everyone is on par instead of a typical classroom while you're still being taught and instructed.
oh my sweet baby jesus, what are you doing to me?

look at the little fluff ball bounce around.

&#x200B;

you know he thinks hes better than all of us, and he would be correct.
One of my students brought in her kitten on Friday for me to kitten-sit while she wrote an exam. I had just been running around in the morning, sitting four exams at once, so I was happy to chill with a kitten all afternoon.
I bet that class was very productive.
Wow, who‚Äôs the chosen one in the corner that lets them pet him?
"Fuck this piece of paper in particular"

-Your kitten, probably
might get romped for this but im allergic to these bois. i think cats are really lovely and all but this would fuck me up lol, im sure the prof checked with everyone beforehand tho to make sure its all good.
Reminds me of the veteran who‚Äôs therapy dog we all had to control ourselves around all semester, but on the last day of class she let her run around so we could all finally have our puppy snuggles. It was glorious.
I wish my college classes had seating arrangements like that. Not only does it create a perfect cat racetrack but you can also freely share knowledge in a Socratic seminar. It's kind of depressing staring at the back of Karen's head for 3 hours while my professor lectures to the middle of the aisle.
TIL how to get perfect attendance in classes.
Oh lawd he learnin'
that is so adorable! I think cats in college classrooms can relieve anxiety
You mean... purretry?
The one who liked it the most was probably the kitten. So many pets that day.
So many poets in a room,. 
That surely I must zoom. 
Between their tables and in their books. 
So the can give me all their looks!  
  
Seven weeks since I was born,  
A single house, was mynorm.  
But today I got to disturb,  
So many poets, quite superb!  
  
In the end, so many people I can meet,  
Move so fast must my tiny feets!  
You'll have to excuse my bad poetry,  
For I learned it in one day.  
  
For now that's all I have to say,. 
There is still so much time to play!  
Now I'll rest my kitty eyes,. 
And to you, I say good bye!
Mr J C Ellefson???????? The best/wisest/calmest teacher/person in the world?
Oh what a cute vide....WAIT THAT'S MY OLD PROFESSOR.
Rejected, rejected, rejected, rejected, rejected, rejected, oh hello yes give pets please
That kitten can't be 7 weeks old. 12 is far more likely.
I want a cat
Wonderful! üòª
is this champlain? looks just like the rooms in ireland haha! (I go there not being creepy I swear)
Serious question. I saw you said somewhere in this thread its a 3 hour class... do you have to bring a litter box? Sorry if thats a dumb question ive never had a cat
If my college classes all had kittens running around on tables, I may have actually showed up and got a degree.
This was several years ago, but Champlain used to have a campus cat named Linus. He would wander into classrooms and hang out behind computers and drink out of the water fountain. One of the other professional writing professors found him distracting and went to take him out, and Linus bit him! I went on to write a short poem about it for Jim's class called 'Ode to Linus'.

P.S. please show Jim all of the awesome poetry people have posted in this thread, he'd love it!
Evergreen?
0 work done that day.
Today at my school was "bring your dog to school day" for all the graduating seniors. I don't have a dog but it was a lot of fun seeing all of them run around.
Honestly, cats used to scare me a bit but my wife LOVES them. Videos like these kinda make me a little bit more willing
The look on the last guy when the kitty didn't make it to him :(
Kittens are so cute and fluffy and cool and satans spawn
The guy at the end getting ready for his 2 seconds of interaction with the kitty
The kid at the end, nonchalantly prepping for the cat to come to him...but doesn't want to look dumb if the cat ignores him.
That kitten is not 7 weeks old lol
Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature,

An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature;

Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses

Contribute to your hunting skills and natural defenses.

&#x200B;

I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations,

A singular development of cat communications

That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection

For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection.

&#x200B;

A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents;

You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance.

And when not being utilized to aid in locomotion,

It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.

&#x200B;

O Spot, the complex levels of behavior you display

Connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array.

And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend,

I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend.

Kitteh hasn‚Äôt yet learned of his responsibility as a cat to knock items off of tables. 

He didn‚Äôt even look twice at that drink
Hes a big boy!
How are there so few people in this classroom? Or is this like a graduate level course?
[Adventure Cat Goes to School.](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/3019126-adventure-cat-goes-to-school)
So awesome! Wish I had had professors like this!
Your professor is really cool
I will go back to school for this.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop at her, because she‚Äôs trying to read her paper.‚Äù
Hey, I think I'll take this class too
Dat lil' slippy slide on the paper!!
Cats that look like they have socks on are the best cats.
Kitten looks 10-12 weeks old. Cute little thing. :)
I was waiting for the kitten to knock the cup off the table, but he didn't.
I saw that it was a poetry class and couldn't believe I recognized the professor. I love Jim, of course he would let you bring in your kitten.
I need more videos
Holy shit is that Jim
WAIT! IS THAT JIM ELLEFSON?!
I love how most of them tried and failed to get a pet in before he stopped running
Let's get real here, no one learned any poetry that day
I hate to be the one saying this but kittens shouldn't be separated from their mothers before 12 weeks, it promotes bad behavioral problems. He seems terrified as well...
Oh my God! Oh my God! Ohhhhhh my godddddddddd üòçüòçüòç

Is this Champlain? Classrooms look super familiar at glance
Champlain! I just graduated last month!

Also a SSB student, never had a class in this room though!

Guy at the end getting kitty-zoned. I can feel that.
That‚Äôs amazing. My cat is so shy I couldn‚Äôt imagine her being comfortable in a new environment, let alone with other people, let alone with so many.
"Frick that paper in particular!" -7 week old kitten
Jim!!!!!! I miss that man
*pawetry
You should have said, "no".
Is this Champlain College?
That‚Äôs not Champlain College is it? JC Ellefson?
This girl in my calc II class in college a few years back brought her pet to class without asking anyone. The professor walked by her, did a double take and freaked out. She brought her fully matured pet boa to class.
Kitty runs

Kitty funs

Kitty learn about puns


Kitty fast

Runs the class

Kitty had a blast


Thank you for reading my short poem.
I wish my teacher would allow my annoying scratching cat to come in our class üòî
Why did he ask you to bring a kitten to class?
Forgive my ignorance but, why would your professor ask you to bring your kitten?  Are you in vet school or something?
RIP people allergic to cats, haha
Cute cat, but always annoyed me having animals in class. Too distracting.
Congrats this is the only productive thing this class will amount to.
[deleted]
Please say you haven't taken it from its mother at 7 weeks. Cats should be at least 10, preferably 12 weeks before sold.
Imagine being the guy with allergies, but you don't say anything because you don't want to be the guy that ended this... and instead you must be miserable because the professor is an inconsiderate ass.
Did you have to bring a litter box for him? He probably got the best cuddles. So many people to sit on!
IS THAT MY CAT?! üòµüòÇ
Thats so AWESOME!
Cute
This is a great professor.  And what a stinkin' cyuuuuuuute kitten,  too.
Poor guy‚Äôs still waiting for the kitten üòø
Were you studying Carl Sandburg at the time
I took a Chaucer class in college while living with a great dane. I would read from the Riverside Chaucer aloud in middle english every night with the dog insisting on having her head on my lap which, in turn left me no option but to rest the enormous tome on her enormous head.

The book weighs over 5 pounds, and yet she wouldn't budge unless I stopped reading, at which point she'd nudge once or twice before starting to get angsty that I'd stopped.

If I started to read again, she'd go limp, if not, it was clearly past story hour and time to go outside for a romp.
Ah yes, but did *you all* learn anything about poetry, is the rub?
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly
He help you pass the class
That  paper skid ü§£ü§£ü§£
Dude at the end‚Äôs an Ezra Koenig doppelg√§nger
Did he get a round of a-paws?
I miss my poetry class. I wish I still wrote.
No work was done that day.
You did not learn how to turn the phone over
Why are cats so cute I can't handle it
Fuck, this sub is gonna make me get another kitten soon
so animal friendly Univ
At one point, it‚Äôs like Pippin says ‚ÄúGet this trash out of here‚Äù and pushes the paper off. 

10/10 would kitten poetry again.

O Kitten! My kitten!!
That guy at the end so bummed it didn‚Äôt keep running
Look at him go lol
Can the kitty explain to me why the poet made the chair blue
We got the zoomies!
Such a cute kitten!! I‚Äôm thinking about getting a kitten or around the same age but I‚Äôve never had a pet before. In your experience, has it been a lot of work/time to raise it or would you say the kitten practically raises itself? Do you have any other tips for raising kittens in general?
I might be a cat person now
That khajit sure is swift
Not to be over dramatic or anything but I would die for your cat
Man I feel bad for the boy waiting for his turn to pet the kitty. He was SOOO prepared.
Reminds me of that time we had an extra long English class and a student asked if he could bring his 3 months old puppy because he couldn‚Äôt leave him alone for 6 hours. 

Needless to say I said yes. Needless to say I was more distracted than my students that day.
That cat legit had more college credits than i

That cat is definitely more than 7 weeks. And it's a good thing.
I just realized that those born in 2000 and 2001 are now in college. Jesus I feel old now.
Looks a bit older than 7 weeks.  More like 12-13
That's poetry in motion!
That's good, because I'm pretty sure no one else there learned anything that day.

And Americans wonder why the Chinese and the Indians dominate academics lol.
u/hauptsachedabei
Damn I wish our teachers at school would let us do this
That guy looking at the kitten at the very end was using one of his Magic Genie Lamp wishes for it to come to him next.

I hope it was granted.
Which university/college is this and where can I apply?
oh my god this kitty is so adorable.
Aww, so cute! I have an 8 week old kitten doing the same thing. This is just as adorable to watch as it is at home.
That‚Äôs a big 7 week old!
I heard his favourite was Edgar Allan Paw.
I'm here to f*** shit up and do cute sh*t with yarn, and i don't see any yarn
I'm terrible at poetry, but I would totally take a poetry class if there were kittens involved.
Your kitten taught your professor poetry?
Best prof. EVER
That's a large kitten for 7 weeks. Mine is 9 weeks and is smaller. It's at least 10-11 weeks or more.
I‚Äôm allergic to cats and I‚Äôd still pet it
I love it  


  
So much
She run so fast
And that day - no work was done whatsoever.

Damn cute
As someone who loves cats but has bad cat allergies...this would be simultaneously the best and worst day ever
I can't wait for my kitten to come in 2 weeks!  
He's 4 weeks now
It looks so big for only beeing 7 weeks
Yeah good luck getting that photo Brienne!
Truly great catting turning on the paper at 5 secs in. 
[This still pretty much sums up the joys of a kitten.](https://m.imgur.com/a/pTX5CHn) Lol too quick to get pats.
The guy at the end was really looking forward to the kitten, until clip cut short. GJ camera person.
I'd literally melt
Some happy faces there üòä
Honest question: why the fuck would you take an animal to a classroom? You and the rest of the people are there to learn, not to play with kittens.

(The kitten is really cute, but that isn't the proper place to take it)
He looks like he enjoyed reading Shakespurr.
that kitten ain‚Äôt 7 weeks old.
Kitten knows learning * see's you * *"MEOW"*
Someone make a petition or something for professors allowing students to brig in their animals as babies
He was happy with his tail up until he slipped on the paper.
You should teach him to poo in your toilet. No kitty litter required!
I've never wanted to be in class so much before.
I am an asshole for saying this, but dangling participle
Omg he's so huge and agile. Meanwhile my 9 week old kittens still slip and fall on their faces half the time.

Who decides to he wanted a guest and he invited my kitty

He dropped a book on the desk and it went boom

My little kitten went around the table in a zoom

I'm taking my 12 yo cat to my daughter's kindy class tomorrow! Wish me luck, I am a bit nervous even though he's a sweetheart who loves everyone.

I have never seen a post in best with this many upvotes, congrats on 100k
I feel for the blonde lady who failed to pat the kitty.
I bet your professor is a cool dude.
I have a question. Did he recognise you among all the other students? Like did he  get to you more often?
Jim effleson (spelling) at Champlain college!?!? Dude plays a mean fiddle if so.
I hope tuition was refunded after this bizarre disruption of the class.
One of my professors was a vet and let me bring my kitten to class so she could bottle feed it! She loved it so much! She would just be teaching and feeding the kitten.
Look at the guy on the right! He‚Äôs preparing for his moment with the kitten üò≠
The look on the last guys face when the kitten didn't even go past him -- priceless
That is so awesome at so many levels!
Animals like that are so cute to watch in a video, but I think I would've ran out of that classroom if I was there :P
I miss that class setup at UCLA.
This looks like bard, is it?

I wish I wasn't a non-traditional student and got my bachelors when I was a "kid" at a school like bard, or in general the kinda college where you have small classrooms and dope ass teachers.
Did the teacher and classmates consent to have likeness uploaded to reddit?

twitter: why is there a cat in my university class.

Reddit: HE‚ÄôS TRYING TO GET HIS FUCKING DEGREE KAREN. LET HIM LIVE HIS 9 LIVES
This is why everyone thinks humanity degrees are a joke! You get to read poetry and play with kittens while angry men did math at me for 5 years!
I wonder how much money this class cost to be worth a kitten day. Ohh, it's poetry.
Proof that millennials are studying useful things like kittens in class and poetry class.  Definitely going to be able to get a job at the poetry factory
Even as cute as this is, I hope the classroom isn't used by someone who's allergic for the next year!
So just fuck the students who are severely allergic right? I like cats but that would totally irritate me if I were severely allergic

this cat looks so excited to be around so many people
Cat should be the real professor !!!
Oh how sweet! My professor used to let my bring my puppy to class with me when she was this age.
Ahhh
It's like he's on a race track. NYOOOOOM

That's soooo cute!! Love your kitty!
Years ago when I was a young Troll, I brought my new German Shepherd Dog into my college speech class. I had been taking him to basic obedience training. So for my Speech of Demonstration I decided I would demonstrate him. He was the Bestest Boy during class and totally stole the show.

I spy a guy who looks like a model/old time movie star,   damn,   and also an adorable kitty.   I love my old cat but I remember when he was like that.
omg
I studied in this fucking building wtf is going on.
To be a good teacher, you need to be of healthy mind. 

It's no surprise we import some of our best and brightest assets.
Is this a grad level class?

An educated cat, skilled in poetry and did attend university classes in his life span! I'll vote for him if he runs for president one day!
I wish I could give class kitten a thousand upvotes.
I wish I went to a school where they had professors. We only had teachers at our schools.
I want my class to be like this
Dude in the tracksuit at the end was really bummed. He was so ready to pet that cat.
When my cats had kittens my parents wanted us to try and see if our friends would take them so one day I brought a kitten to school and kept it hidden during class. That happened to be the day that my religion teacher who also taught music brought in a stew drum band, and that kitten crawled my up arm like a tree.

Best class ever!!! Purrr poetry!!
Best class ever.
Is that  you he ran straight to?
cute cat!
Your kitten looks a lot like mine !
The cat was loving it!!!
I had to watch at least nine times to figure out the hand at the very end was, in fact, a hand holding a pen and not a second set of kitten ears.
Hi, I'm jealous.

You have no idea how much I want to bring my cat to work.
What a little cutie.
That is disgustingly cute xD
The last dude looks depressed and really happy that a cat is in his class that day
‚ÄúFuck this sheet of paper in particular‚Äù
Poor guy on the right side of the table. The kitty skipped him. No kitty love for him.
 Reminds me of the veteran who‚Äôs therapy dog we all had to control ourselves around all semester, but on the last day of class she let her run around so we could all finally have our puppy snuggles. It was glorious.
Who had the bando cup?!
May the kitty gods bless cat people and English professors
I don't think he knew about how old the kitten was
Right in the allergies
That kitty calls for a good limerick.
It's a circle... pet.
I *NEED* to know, are you the person the kitty stops at at the end?
Seems like a comfy class, especially with the layout of tables
dude at the end getting ready to pet kitten got blown off.
Awww, adorable. :D

We as humans need more kittens in our lives. 

I mean just look at this
If you track the kittens feet it spells nevermore
Awh I feel bad for those that didnt get to pet your kitten
The guy at the end seemed bummed the kitten didn't come to him lol
That cat knew from across the room with person it wanted to get scritches from.
Omg! Why isn't this a thing in every schools?

Fuck your car dude
So cute! Took over the class from the look of it.
The cat comes in

On little fog feet.
I have only one problem: I can't hear the cute kitty
I would have enjoyed school much more with cats or dogs in class with me.
almost wiped out
"Hey look at me. I'm the professor now!" - Kitten
Today... speed run.

As adult cat... cat parkour!
 Fuck, this sub is gonna make me get another kitten soon
So cute :D I want to have a cat also! :D
He just pushes the kid's paperwork off the table omg.
Seems like an allergy concern for everyone else using that room for that week.
Careful it looks like you have an exceptionally brave kitten on your hands.
She got a proper pet while on the run then just screached to a halt for more. Good kitty!
Excuse me op does he have a license to baby?

Some 7 week old kitties are born for this some would hide under something and never come out.
How inconsiderate.
I only see one kitten, not seven. And that kitten looks older than a week old, about seven times older from the looks of him.
I see everyone is getting ready to pet the kitten, but not everyone gets it.
Such confidence! That's awesome. My cat's would just hide in a corner somewhere.
This is happiness
Wow, sure was nice of your kitten to teach your professor about poetry!
such cutieeee üòçüò≠
I feel really bad for the blonde girl. He just goes right past her.
Stupid edumacated people.

How you like that!
I‚Äôve been trying to look at other posts but I keep coming back to watch this again. Seriously can‚Äôt get enough of the cuteness
The kitten scratched my paper work
FUCK YOUR PAPER
That cat looks a lot older than 7 weeks. Kittens shouldn't  leave their mother until 12 weeks anyway.
What a fluffy cat
Hell yeah
your professor is so cool for allowing you bring your kitten.
Im cuddling my cat as i see this god i love animals

Why no sound?!
Nobodies gonna comment on that dude wearing shorts with knee high black socks?! 

Am I out of touch? 
No it‚Äôs the children who are wrong.
That guy in black at the end looks so bummed that the kitten didn't come to him.
I literally squealed out loud watching this. I want to go to this school!! :)
the boy at the end is a fool he is putting his phone even closer to the edge
The guy in the black jacket to your right was definitely checking you out.
THAT'S ADORABLE
If prose be turtle, why then poetry be kitten.
I need to do this!

-A Professor
That last guy in the Adidas jacket is so full of anticipation.
When are you supposed to take a kitten from the mother? It's 8 weeks for puppies. But this kitten looks pretty well developed.
Is this kitten really only that young?
last kid got left hanging and tried to play it off.
She is so pretty. This is her childhood, So she is playing.
Could I have a cuddle from that little one?!
Is this ottawa u?
My stupid ass thought you meant that the kitten learnt a lot about poetry.
–ö—Ä—É—Ç–æ
How did the kitten factor into the professor learning poetry?
ahh that slide...like everyone noticed
The cat stuff and all is cool but damn your classroom is nice. Good chairs, tables etc and you sit in a circle so you see each other, what seems much better
The cat walk on table !
**SUCH A CUTIE**
Awwwwwwww

Pippin is an amazing name. My Pipp'sters was my everything. He was my  big boy at 120lbs. My beautiful baby boi, cuddle bear and protector.  Kiss and hugs yours tightly for me.
Oh lawd he zoomin‚Äô
Cats? Eh. Kittens? Yes please

Your cat is breathtaking.
The next guy nervously took note of his phone's position on the desk
Is a tiger! üêÖ
The kitten is making sure that nobody cheats.
Gotta love learning about poetry in a place charging astronomical amounts to teach you about a job.
AAAAAAAAH so cute ¬∞>\_<¬∞
and no work got done that day
This is great!! Helps the cat learn to be social too, which is what a lot of feline lovers tend to skip out on. Now you just need a class where everyone brings their pet..
LOL, She run a circle and stop
Haha that bloke at the end was devestated the cat didnt come to him
That‚Äôs a class I want to join
Super cute unless anyone was allergic :)
r/airplaneears
So friggin adorable!
I wouldn't be happy about this as I have sever allergy to cats. Hence why I only watch them online.
Why? What was the reason?
Nice of him.
Why do you have a 7 week old kitten?
That dude with the black Jersey was so ready to pet the citten but didn't get chosen. Feels bad man.
Cat sweet
Where is the poem about a cat learning about poems?
Where‚Äôd he poop
This made me so happy
Love this! This helps students maintain focus on the class.
god the professor looks so happy while the kitten walks past
You missed the unique opportunity to use the term "Paww-etry"
Are you the person where the kitten stopped?
His ears! r/airplaneears

Awwww
I NEED that kittenüòÇüòç
Graystripe!
Hopfully nobody was allergic to that cutie
Why aren‚Äôt people clapping?
This is the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve seen a long time
THIS IS SO CUTE I HATE IT!!!!!
My teachers would even let us bring drinks in class, drinks as coca cola and pepsi...and your teacher let's a murder mitten to roam around the classroom???
Oh my cuteness. Speaking of which, just the other day my sister found an abandoned kitten after she and her boyfriend were packing up to move, thinking the mom would come back to get him. She didn't after a day so my sister found where she was hearing the increasingly desperate mews, little dude was just barely over 3 weeks old. She and her boyfriend have a couple pitbulls, which despite being two of the best behaved doggos I know wouldn't have been good for the lil nugget since he was just so damn tiny and weak. No second thoughts, I took him into my care and I am so glad I did when I had, because without a doubt he was on the brink of dying. Poor midget was too weak to even suck the KMR out of the nipple so I had to use a dropper, slowly doing so just in case his little body couldnt handle too much food after being malnourished. Been a couple days but little guy is making great progress! Finally can use the bottle, it's slightly sad but so cute to see how frantic he is to eat! Very rewarding to watch him get his strength back.

Named him Taggerung, any Redwall fans out there probably know why I chose the name lol. I have to take him to my work at my clinic, and goddamn man all I can say is bottle babies are quite the task to take on. So rewarding though:) your kitteh is adorable by the way! Cant wait for my mini living razor blade to have the energy yours has. Only a couple more weeks!:)
All the poems in this comments section, yet no Sprog...

Adorable kitty btw, he looks like he's having fun! :)
7 weeks is way too young, minimum is 8, best is 12
Haha, adventurous little one.
You mean your professor learned a lot about poetry?
poetry in motion!
Just love that beaming smile on the brunette's face
Seriously cute.  Hard to say no to a kitten.
He really want to separate poetry class, so that why, he ignoring all.  and go straight to his teacher.
The "my cat clawed out my homework" excuse needed some concrete proof.
Cute little predator!
That is a massive 7 week old kitten
ITS SO CUTTTEEEE
7 week? What happend that he had to leave his mom that young?
awww so cute  :)
I wish my school would let me do that
I bet the students didn't
Hi! What college do you go to? Im...uh... asking for a friend...
I want more of this "s"cool cat ;)
That cat is only seven weeks old?

It's going to be huge as an adult!
I wish i could do this at our class
There it is, the cutest thing I‚Äôm going to see today!
Looks like TCC
Kitten is adorable, but that room is gorgeous...
**run**
Thats a big 7 week kitten!!! Love how he greats each person.
What a great class to be in!
Your Professor looks so happy
That would be just the best class ever!!
Poetry in motion
Aww
Do you bring a litter box with you or just pray? I always want to bring mine places but taking the whole kit seems like a mission.
That was nice to see everyone with a smile on there face
So this is how you keep a poetry class awake
I love how everyone wants to pet kitty
His little tum tums
So fast!
Poetry in motion.

I think I‚Äôd enjoy class a lot more if there were kittens in it everyday!
Aaaww sooo cuuuteee ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
I guess you can do this when it is not a real class.
U got A gr8 prof
Makes me miss my creative writing courses
I demand a schooldoodledo limerick

Kinda poetic: in a place unexplored, the cat searches about. Seeing a familiar face, it‚Äôs tail rises again. Home is found
Best.Class.Ever
Very sweet kitty.......
Oh! Did he run back to you? So cute!
What‚Äôs the name of the professor, I need to go back to school.
So cute!
I like your professor. He can stay.
He looks big for only seven weeks! You might have a little terror on your hands-when they're separated from mom too young they can be very bitey and spaztastic.
This is absolutely wonderful!
Poetry in motion‚ù§Ô∏è
Why is this not in wholesome memes üòç
Poetry in motion.
I want you to pet me, but when you do, I‚Äôll pretend that I don‚Äôt care about it.

-typical cat
Best. Class. EVER.
Aww this is adorable. Love the kittens -Momma Upland
He looks so happy, I love him. üòä
Catta does a circle.
Who taught the professor a lot about poetry? Was it the cat?
I love everything about this. Kitty will be very helpful for poetry workshops!
Kitten can't figure out how to lay on all the homework
That looks just like my asshole when he was a baby! And your professor is awesome. Hahah
My kitten doing the same in home...
I love how he is just running laps getting pets
Im glad the cat was able to teach to teach the professor about poetry!
What a cutie but looks way older than just 7 weeks.
s.    m.    o.    l.    c.    a.    t

Can I join your class?
So what did your kitten teach the Professor about poetry?
Look at that girl smile.  Damn I need a kitten.
r/zoomies
More classes need kittens
So adorable!
Poor cat
I'd be pissed, I'm allergic to cats.
So cute!
the guy at the end is devastated that the cat didnt come near him
Mm
kitties are so fucking cute.
This is the cutest thing I've seen all day.
Get out of the way
That's no kitten! That's an itty bitty lil' tiger dude
Me being allergic to cats: 
Guess I'm dead ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Is this what all liberal arts students do in class?
That guy at the end is real pretty
Okay sooo I‚Äôm first of all cute
/u/vredditshare
How did you convince your professor of this?
You have one nice teacher.
I was a bit nervous when he ran near that tumbler lol
Well that‚Äôs just silly. What if there were people there with allergies? Man what they get away with in colleges is amazing.
I'm allergic to cats so I really hope he asked the other students if it was ok first. I'd hate to show up to class and know I coudln't be there because someone wanted a cat in class.
It‚Äôs so playful
That last man really wanted to pet that cat
r/watchpeopledieinside that guy really wanted to pet that kitty :(
Professors have seemed to soften since my day.
annnnnd... FUCK YOUR PAPERS!
He‚Äôs so happy omg
I want a cat üò¢.... I've been a dog person all my life and r/aww has made me love all animals so much more
He‚Äôs on a mission
Who learned a lot about poetry: the professor, or the kitten?
can i have your professer, id love to be told to bring my cat in
\*you're 20 years old, you need to start acting like an adult, don't freak out, it's just a kitten, you've seen tons of them\*

Keanu!
Li‚Äôl shit‚Äôr!
Nice thing for the teacher to do
Baby
Is your professor creed
Two things:

1: are u gonna tell Jim he went viral? U should tell Jim he went viral.

2: I'm literally 0% shocked that Jim allowed this
College  professors > high school teachers
Pets > pics
not a good idea to bring in class room,everyone ingage with them and forget about studies
[removed]
Why did your teacher allow a pet in class?
So young though. 
In Sweden you're not allowed by law  to separate the kitten from it's mother before it's turned 12 weeks.
Love how the kitten only knocked one person‚Äôs paper off, like fuck you specifically
I love the idea of kittens in lectures.  But how much are those students paying to play with that cat effectively lol
He said: SKRRT SKRRRT on that sheet of paper
Where do you go to college? Asking so I can enroll!
pretty much what i would expect from liberal arts students. Your parents are literally paying for day camp
[deleted]
Hahahaha.....love it.....without our animals, this little world of ours doesn‚Äôt go around.......
ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
I would never skip a class if there were kittens involved. 

Improve student attendance

Get more foster cats adopted. 

[I see this as an absolute win](https://imgur.com/gallery/gkowpHF)
Not to be a bummer bc this is really cool, but what about students with allergies?
Sounds like the perrrrrrrrfect class
Anyone else dumb enough to read that and think for a second that because a 7 week old kitten went to class the professor learned a lot about poetry?
Noway that kitten is only 7 weeks old. You shouldn't even separat a kitten from its mother before it hits the 12 week mark if you can avoid it.
Best.  Professor.  Ever!
Ah liberal arts. Paying 40k a year for this kiddos.

Source: Prof.
Pretty sure that kitten is older than '7 weeks". That looks more like "3 months".
Ohhhhh i hate cats
Your professor is a wise and good man. 

He‚Äôs definitely teaching more than poetry.

So, basically fuck all the students who are allergic to cats?(who are paying out the ass for the class).
Your professor is an asshole and so are you.
Animals don‚Äôt belong in the classroom.
