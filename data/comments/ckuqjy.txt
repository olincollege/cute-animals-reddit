My barber has to do the same thing with me when I need a trim.
Oh, you wanted to pet me?  You should have said something.  You may proceed.
*STRANGER DANGER!!!!!!!!STOOOOOOPP!!!!NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ok maybe I overreacted*
I'm a dog person, but I would muzzle that.
Those furminators are incredible.  You can do a great job of keeping undercoat under control and minimize shedding with that thing.
give this person a raise!! there’s so many horror stories about groomers, we need more of this.

Brave woman.

Our cat bit his doctor recently and you would think a veterinarian would have some of these same skills to avoid being bit by their patients.  

This can be very serious to deal with as these animals are sometimes reported to the city, especially if the injured person seeks medical attention. Luckily everything worked out for us. My son made [this ](https://imgur.com/gallery/xp3HCnJ)to cheer me up.
That looks more like flooding than trust building
That is fear anxiety for sure.. 

Poor guy hasn't been trained properly to deal with his trauma
Previous dog groomer here.
Just stopped by to say that Shiba Inu's are hands down some of the craziest, high anxiety dogs I've ever dealt with. It's a shame that pitbulls have the reputation they do, because that reputation really applies more to Shibas.  Cute dogs, but need a ton of exercise and attention otherwise they will drive you nuts and likely be unpredictable/dangerous.
Props to this groomer.
“What was I snarling about?”
For real though that dog needs some socializing before it bites somekne
I am watching this video as my wife is on the deck brushing our Shiba and the thing is screaming like a drowning baby.
This is why you tip your groomer way more than your hairstylist! Any hairstylist would turn you away if you bit, shit, and screamed during your haircut, bath, and anal gland squirting
Here are a few pointers on how she does it:

Avoid eye contact, eye contact gives the message that you're challenging him.

The butt is a place dogs accept as a sign of compassion, it's pretty universal, though if your dog is used to you petting his head and neck it might also recognize those aswell.
The groomer is showing good “dog manners” by the way she’s doing this. Note that she starts at the rear and sides - this is the “polite” way dogs greet each other - by sniffing or rubbing up against the sides of the dog. (If you’re a human, and not good with dogs, know that it’s always safer to initiate petting on the sides while also turning your body sideways to make yourself smaller/less threatening. Our instinct is to pet heads and that freaks some dogs out.) 

It’s also worth noting that while the dog is tolerating this treatment, it’s still not quite happy. The body is tense and the lip licking is a classic nervous tick indicating some level of stress. He basically dialed down his response a level from snarling. A dog in this state can still easily be set off and possibly bite so you still need to be guarded. Some of his anxiety is likely just from being restrained and knowing he can’t get away if this strange human turns out to be unfriendly. It’s likely if he was unrestrained he would have put up with the brushing with just the lip licking and not the snarling. (But obviously it makes sense for him to be restrained for grooming for safety reasons.)

For anyone who’s got a dog, especially if you frequent a dog park, I suggest spending 10 minutes on YouTube watching dog body language videos. It’s fascinating. They are telling you a lot more than you realize and if you know what to look for you can avoid awkward encounters. Your “unpredictable” dog that snapped at the schnauzer at the dog park was actually telling you 5 minutes ago she was uncomfortable. Learning a little bit about canine body language is also useful for people who are scared of dogs so they can recognize friendly ones and know how to calm agitated ones.
Get your dog accustomed to grooming and being handled/messed with as early as possible to prevent this. Props to this gal, she would’ve had every right to just send this pupper home
Everything I have been told about these dogs is they are assholes lol.  Super cute though
If you’re dog is like this, you should really groom it yourself or fix its aggression problems.
I live for that awkward moment when he can’t decide if he even needs to be in attack mode right now.

Just sort of closes his mouth and turns away

“...well, shit.”
Ehh, animal behaviorist here: so this dog is still SUPER stressed and fearful, the behavioral indicators have just changed. the lip licking behavior is a classic sign of discomfort. That dog could still snap at any time.
Mom says I get to repost this next month
Please remember to thank your veterinarian and vet techs! We have to poke that with needles and make it get x-rays.
I work in the veterinary world. Shibas are instant muzzle.
That dog is still not calm. The licking of the lips is a sign of anxiety. That groomer is lucky she didn’t lose a finger. She’s have been better off starting with treats or something a bit more enticing/rewarding to the dog.
Beautiful! Simply beautiful. It is obvious that Doggo'd been hurt before, but the groomer is not backing down, always balancing on the edge of Doggo's fear, until Doggo enjoys caresses on the head.
Dang that boi was ANGERY
Sorry to burst your bubble, but this isn’t talent.

All she seems to have done is not back down and the dog realized that it’s snarling and snapping wasn’t going to work.

This didn’t magically then create a fear-free environment for the dog.  It just gave up, turned its anxiety into itself and then froze

You’ve either got fight, flight, or freeze.

Flight was removed with the harness. Fight proved not to work. All that was left was freeze.

There are so many better ways to go about this then just persistence.
Cream shibas are vicious lmao
As a dog groomer I started using this method after seeing this gif and it works like a charm almost every time
The dog head turning after being patted - “hmmm that’s not bad actually “
Oof, copyright claimed. Anyone got a link to the original?
That isn't trust. The way the dog continues to lick its lips and turn its head while she brushes him are stress signals. They are highly uncomfortable and anxious. Since she doesn't understand those signals, the dog has switched from anxious to aggressive.

She's just doing her job, but that dog 100% does not truat her or feel comfortable in the slightest.
That dog is still scared shitless I don't think there was trust at all here.  Fight wasnt working so it just submitted.  You can bet that if there was no wall or harness it would have jumped. (Flight)
That is a horribly socialized dog.
Downvote me to hell but this is not trust. Can we please get this dog a muzzle and some gabapentin and/or trazodone? Everyone would be much better off.
With sound (kinda). https://youtu.be/Z4b3cz0hg_g
I've never owned a dog, but I think it should learn not to be quite that angry to strangers.
Isn't this a repost I swear I saw this twice already
Damn that's a difficult job
The dog still looks tense as hell. But she did good real good
Late to the party but what kind of asshole brings a dog like this to get groomed and peace’s out?
Dog:......... Okay, I guess.
I've bathed and done nail trims on hundreds of dogs and in my experience, if a dog wants to bite you it'll bite you. Dogs like this are all bluster and warning and it's mostly due to fear of being hurt, which is totally understandable! You let them tell you their comfort level and you build up to it.

Sometimes you can call their bluff, too. I've had dogs snap and snarl at me and when I've left my hand there to let them make contact they pull away as soon as their teeth touch skin. It develops a rapport, like "okay I'm not going to hurt you, and I KNOW you're not going to bite me, let's get this bath over with!"
I'd love to see the rest. 

Nail trim, bath, blow dry, finish brush. 

This dog is super reactive and will take a lot.longer than 60 seconds to calm. Probably the better part of a year with 4-6 week exposure to the same groomer.
_”ok this actually feels kinda nice”_
I like how the dogs face is like "oh, well thats not so bad" haha
So I assume the lady creates trust some point after this video, right? I'm not seeing it here.
Poor dog, he probably thinks shes gonna hit him from experience.
Why wouldn’t the owner clean the dog themselves if it’s this scared?
Those dogs are awful.
can this work for my grandma?
The sheeb looks like it’s sad after she starts to pet it, oh I uh, should have been nice, I feel really bad now
that moment when he goes from “FUCK no” to “pats you say? let’s see how this plays out”
Screw that im not grooming Kujo
Why doesn't this dog have a muzzle?
Very patient and aware groomer but the dog's still acting like a psycho and should probably be muzzled for the sake of everyone involved.
How does she sit in chairs with balls that big..?
I use to groom dogs and was the only Male worker and they would always give me the beasts, and use to do lil tricks like this. I also just was naturally good at handeling dogs  which is odd because one tore me apart when I was 6 for touching its butt.  But I never let it scare me, I mean they became  my only friends for majority my life
They are more related to wolves than even huskies. The chow chow, shiba inu, Akita Inu, and Malamute are the closest to wolves, followed by huskies and some other similar breeds. There is a term for more “ancient” breeds but I forget it. Maybe it’s just ancient or primitive breeds

But he really look like a mini wolf-er
Stop with the reposts
This is just like my pit mix. He broke out in hives a couple of weeks ago due to being stung and we brought him to the vet hospital that night. He was so happy, excited and friendly (and VERY swollen) to start off, but then got very scared of the vet tech trying to check his bumps & teeth. The vet tech tried to take a temperature and that was NOT happening. Then the doc came in and mentioned that he should be recorded for the perfect example for a dog in fear. Started off friendly, but then doesn't trust anyone to touch him do to past trauma. It's sad because our pit is extremely loving with us, but doesn't trust anyone else until he gets to know them. I can imagine this has happened with many more pets who are adopted.
Who’s fucking out of control dog acts like that?! That dog has been seriously mistreated.

This is not "awww." This is an untrained animal that could have hurt someone. No, shibes are not "drama queens." This dog's owner is lazy and should feel bad for possibly encouraging this kind of behavior. Train your animals, people.
I did that with a rock once
this dog sitting here like " what kind of sorcery is this"
what's that job pay?  15$ an hour?  fook no.
Not worth whatever hourly wage this job pays.
I hope they pay these folks a lot!
This title is assumptive, she already has her hand on it, the brush already has fur on it, not to mention we have no idea how this was already happening.

Yeah no this isn’t how this usually plays out for dog groomers, unfortunately.
If only I could do this with my new cat that hates me

If I only had that affect on women....Hawkeye Pierce
That dog is still pissed off,  just not Im going to bite you pissed off
I'll always upvote this. It's so sweet. Poor pup is just scared :(
Those dogs have such shitty characters unless properly trained it shouldn't be sold to everyone without questions....
I wouldn't care that trust
Dog : STOP STOP DON'T DO IT...... hey this isn't that bad
I’m happy with this type of littering 😃

Oh ho so you're approaching me?
This is me easing into Monday mornings
People who are good with animals are my spirit animal.
Just my opinion but I dont really think this belongs on r/aww
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME AT ONCE, HUMAN SCU- hmmm this is actually quite nice.
like the last time this was posted: this is not how you treat a scared animal. they are unpredictable and your best option to get them to trust you is to first allow them to sniff your hand. this is not how dogs learn to trust people and only causes them undue stress.
Wow, that is quite amazing! She's a very brave lady and excels at doing her job.
What a great groomer... 
No telling what set off that cute pup-dog.
Begone from me hooman!... actually, this isn't so bad, I will allow you to continue.
Its really commendable how the groomer creates trust. She knows her job so well!
That poor pup is so so scared. :( she's amazing with it though.
Gosh I can believe it, this dog looked so angry and scared and aggressive
why are shiba-inus always so dramatic lol
I love the face he /she gives. "Oh fuck I was really overreacting there"
Omg this is so scary. Is this what groomers have to deal with? Do all dogs act like this at first? 👀👀
Erm... i don´t see any trust there.
Alternatively, if your dog acts like that, maybe groom your own dog?
Shibas are such drama queens.  It's embarrassing taking them to the vet.
This dog’s owners suck
 Oh, I feel so bad for the doggie! It's absolutely terrified!
I dont think Id call it "trust" as much as an understanding that they arent holding something painful. The dog still looks on edge every time she does something different.
I wish this groomer knew how many times her clip got reposted on reddit! I upvote everytime! Glad to see that this clip is a bit longer!
"Damn I'm such a bad guy! The lady just wanted to pet me!"
Is there a version on video with audio?
Now try that with your girlfriend’s 65 pound Boxer.
You can see the moment he goes from defense mode to "oh we're doing the pats".
No! No! Nononono! Oh. Oh dats nice😂
LOL he was like "omg I'm so embarrassed"
"Oh oh I'm quite embarrassed now."
That went from 100 to 0 really fast
Unpopular Opinion : Dog owner sucks, if this was my dog I’d view my entire ownership a fail. 

(Owner of Doberman/Rottweiler cross)

Created a bond of trust that the dog would literally die fighting for me but only if it was a legitimate threat. It’s my opinion as a dog owner you should be able too give your dog to anyone in the world and they should treat that person with complete love and respect as long as they aren’t harming them or making fun of them.  And at worst he would growl, never bare teeth if he feels a need to tell them to back off. But this shouldn’t have to Be part of a groomers job sadly it is.
[sound](https://youtu.be/ZrQz5ak_1XUp)
The look on the Shibe’s face seems so regretful, like “Damn now I feel like an idiot” ahhahaha
Some people have no idea how to control their pets and it becomes painfully obvious for people like this. lol
"No. No! No!.... N... Ooh. I kinda like that. Proceed."
Old video..

Great experienced groomer! I was a vet assistant for 5 years so I understand this too well.

These breeds are super cute but unfortunately tend to be nervous/aggressive with strangers..
Legendary patience.
Always saw a short version of this. Nice to see the longer clip!
That dog was really giving her the brush-off.
Anyone know what the vest says?

“Beware: I’m an asshole”? 😂

Also Shiba Bite-Me’s
I miss my Shiba
He's not vicious, he's just scared.
This is taken halfway through. You can see the brush covered in hair. Poor thing was probably all matted and was hurt so didnt trust her after that.  Brush your dogs and cats yourself daily so this doesnt happen. Plus you save money. Dont give me crap about time cuz if you have time to pet your dog and love it, you have time to brush it at the same time. Better for you, better for the dog, and better for your wallet!
Somebody pay the lady twice what she is getting now pls
Good lord this dog needed a muzzle stat. Why risk it. It's better for the groomer and the dog. Do you really want to subject the dog and its owner to a mandated rabies quarantine because appropriate precautions had not been met??
Hes still really nervous the whole time. You can tell because hes licking his lips.
This dog should be muzzled. Such a bite risk here. Still, quite impressed with the groomer. Beautiful dog, too.
Shibes are naturally overly dramatic - with an attitude like that the owner should groom him themselves lol.
Hero of the week!
He’s like” HEY HEY HEY HEY HEy hey... that feels nice”
Nasty dog.
Fuck that dog
A talented dog owner would not have a dog that needs a snake whisperer to groom their dog.
shiba's are just shitty dogs
It's that "Oh... maybe I was an ass?" face lol
Prolly the meanest dog in the neighborhood...
If that was my dog, it would continue barking the moment you took your hand away.
As a kennel worker, I have to say, people like that are one in a million.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4b3cz0hg_g
funny, i found out i could do a similar thing with my dog a few days ago. sometimes when we’re playing and she has a toy in her mouth (me being the one who has to take it), she’ll hide under one of our beds. i usually just give up when she does this, since she gets so defensive when i try to do as much as get my hand close to her. but then, i just tried gently tapping her leg, and then slowly do small petting with my finger. she’ll then calm down, and let me pet her with my hand.
Whatever this person is getting paid, is too low.
That looks like me trying to trust someone in a new relationship.
"Hey. HEY! DON'T TOUCH M- Oh that actually feels kinda nice. Shit, now I feel like an asshole. Do I apolo- HEY DON'T YOU TOUCH ME!"
I’m curious as to how she was able to get the one hand at the collar before the shibe noticed. Either way, very patient groomer and gentle groomer
I have a white shiba. She doesnt play with the black and brown shibas in my complex so shes probably racist.
Poor plumpkin was just scared, a little reassurance went a long way,
[Spot,  runter. Spot,  runter!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO5ThFd5qas&list=PLKA_WqdzIF5XlKBO60F4YBW20qElfoQ6y&index=14)
I wish I could do this
He then eats it
is that a tourniquet on her left arm?   you know, like just in case?
That is how my brother's shiba behaved with everyone other than my brother for the first few of years of its life. There are still less than a dozen people that it has ever let pet him.
Shiba inus are the worse when it comes to all bark and no bite.

Absolute balls of steel, I love dogs so much but I had to dog sit for cousin for a week and she had a dog like that aggressive but it ended up biting my hand quite bad and I get really jumpy now around smallish dogs like that, I now look after a friends dog that’s lovely and it’s helping a lot :)
Awww that's so cute. 
How can one manage a cat while at the groomer ?
Furminator, not just for people
The way this talented groomer creates trust with this shibe in less than 16 seconds.
i wanna attack but it feels so good  hnbnngnggh
Dog realized after a while the lady wasn't going to hurt him.
I really wish i could control the volume level of these videos @Reddit - my ears are destroyed
Magical
My parents own a mini schnauzer and he's very laid back about everything except trimming his beard. He's been through three different groomers because they won't see him anymore after he bit them while they were trimming his beard :(
Would like to know who this kind person is
That dog needs a xanax
That look of “it’s all gonna be alright” #wow
Oh wow, have only ever seen the first bit of this floating around as a gif, the full thing is a lot more satisfying.
This is exactly what over thinking looks like haha
She's my hero of the day.
I've read Shibas aren't very sociable and can get mean with strangers.  Very Japanese now that I think of it. 

God, they're so cute tho.
Or the drugs just kicked in...
*Everyone liked this*
Clever girl...🦖
I actually got bit by a dog for the first time today. For some reason, even when they seem pissed off, the most they do to me is bark
Our vet sprays spray cheese on the table to distract our dog while she examines him and gives him pets
Impressive.
Now THAT is marriage material.

The groomer seems nice too.
Are Shibes naturally aggressive or is this one just poorly socialized?
Harness says it all really.
Dog: Oh shit, I’m sorry
Watching this and I'm smh why groomers won't give us a callback because we own a pitbull.
Well, that deescalated quickly
That baby looks embarrassed. Haha
Wow. If a dog was going at me like that I wouldn't go anywhere near it.....
She's clearly done this many, many times before.
hahaha u can see the moment the pups like "hold up this patting thing is alright"
She looks like Angela from the office.
"HEY GET OFF ME!
HEY GET OFF! 
HEY!
Ayyyyy" - the dog probably
Was holding my breath hoping this wasn't on r/yesyesyesno
I couldn’t hear well. Was that Portuguese?
Vet student and former tech. I'm impressed. I'll have to remember that sneaky hand circling motion to take a less direct approach
His face just says “aw shit man now I look like an idiot...”
A muzzle with the same approach seems a bit more apropos.
“Oh okay, this is fine, then.”
Those dogs are fucking crazy
Did anybody else count the fingers on her hand first?
Much talent.
Don’t you fucking touch me bit- oh ohhh that’s fucking good.
NO! STAY AWAY! GET YOUR DEVIL PAWS OFF MEoh thats actually quite nice carry on
This is me, when I'm tryin to get frisky with mamma.
What is this sorcery?
She's using the furminator wich can be painfull at times, maybe the dog knows and was a little scared
r/AnimalTextGIFs please add text to this
How the hell do they harness and get them up there in the first place?
When I first saw this 5 years ago it was very touching
Isnt that a shock collar though? Looks like it's got some LEDs and shit
Aw scared puppy
Pretty much how the wolf was tamed.
That's Lithuanian she's speaking right?
I wish someone would do that to me
that dog is naughty af
It’s all fun and games till the dog hears “execute order 66” in his earpiece.
Howd they get that harness on?
What keeps the dog from going for the arm holding him in place?  It seems like he’d be able to at least give her a bite there.  Maybe he’s just fixated on what she’s doing with her hand?
former dog groomer here  


100% chance this dog got muzzled when the clippers came out
Incredible!!
She looks like she's done this so many times
Cute doggo nice doggo
Sometimes good boys need reassurance that people can be good too
Alexa, what's acquiesce?
What’s wrong with his adowable snaggle toof ÔwŌ
10 seconds of not being bitten at is not enough time for the shibe to build trust with me though.
Some people truly do have a gift, a special way with animals.
I just realized. I would hate to be a groomer in Japan. Shibes are so against grooming this must just be a regular Thursday for this poor groomer.
My local petsmart employees won’t even dry my dog if she resists and this lady risking bites to brush a dog.

Smh
“I rip your damn hand—hands soft”
Someone needs to train their dog...
DONT TOUCH ME!

DONT TOUCH ME!

DONT TOU...oh..wait

Wait...this is interesting

Yeah that was itching for a while.

Oh yes grab the comb.
“Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you twi- wait. *This* is what you wanted to do? Well that’s not so bad. Don’t forget the spot between my ears.”
“Oh. Oh, this is actually quite nice.”
Can someone teach me how to do this so I can get better at PILP hunting? 

Puppy I'd Like to Pet FYI.
Not always but they can cut coat. Not in the way a shear can but like a sharp stripping knife.
You literally see the moment where he realizes, "hey, this ain't so bad".
Why is this person even dropping their dog off to the groomer
Pet the animal before it's even on the table?
Why the fuck doesnt it have a muzzle
I'm not a fan of Shibes. They're not as friendly as you'd think.
She does look a little Chinese...
As a Shiba Inu owner I can literally hear this gif...
That's honestly the least chill shibe I've ever seen...
FUCK YOU!

I SAID DONT TOUCH ME! DONT EVEN GET NEAR ME!

WOMAN, YOU DEAF!?‽

I SEE YOUR GOT DAMNED HAND RIGHT THERE. IM GONNA TAKE A CHUNK!

GODAMMIT I SAID NO!

WHA?

Oh, that is rather nice. Yes, please continue.  

So, I guess I’ll just sit here then.
Know what else builds trust for groomers? Benadryl.
I need a groomer like this. I have a Shiba and no groomer seems to handle her well. She’s a total tweak like most Shibas, but still.
She's better at creating trust than all six of the therapists I've seen.
Less than 30 seconds, but who's counting?
It's almost like he got confused over why he was angry from the beginning.
the fuck would you even bring your dog to a groomer for if thats how violently they react to strangers?
Hey gwtf are u doing bich get off me
Back off BARK BARK bitch
dont touchche me dont fuc
oh

ooooooh that’s not bad

If you watch this backwards it is about a dog who h a t e s petting
I HATE THIS!! I HATE THIS!!  I HATE THIS!! Wait, ahhh, this is not so bad after all.
She is brave and talented.
"Hey...that's actually pretty good!"
Not really trust, the licking once turned shows the dog is still very nervous. I'd say this is a show of inhostility none the less aimed at subverting the aggression.

Well oriented and patient handler.
The look on this dog's face, like "Oh."
Nice that the groomer knows how to handle this
Well, that deescalated quickly.
I can’t unhear Tony Baker
Amazing professional.  We need more like her on grooming pet salons.
That’s honestly amazing
I would have a muzzle on that dog.
Remember you are not petting your pet, your pet is petting you.  Ssshht
“5 more minutes of this and I’m gonna get mad.”
Working in veterinary medicine is like this, but the dog has a broken leg, you have to stick it with needles, make it sit still for x-rays,  and do a physical exam all within a limited time frame.
So I don't usually say anything about re posts but I see this video like every other month, how does it keep reaching front page?
While she has impressive control, this is not safe. That dog should be muzzled, preferably by the owner while the pup is comfortable (I know many people might think of muzzles as "cruel", but a well made muzzle is comfortable for the pup and will only impede biting, not breathing or panting). This is not only for the groomers safety, but the dogs as well. A bad bite can cause an instinctive reaction that can yank pups off the table or shove them into walls--and while she's using a nice harness, this stuff can still hurt them. 

Family has groomed for 2 generations. My mother who now runs the shops would never have allowed any of her girls to put that dog on the table without adequate restraint (And 2 of her groomers also train dogs for a living--still wouldn't happen. The liability is too significant.) I have to imagine the groomer probably knows the dog really well already and knows how to get the pup to calm down.
Don't see any trust there.
He protec. He attac. But most importantly, he lets her brush his bac
More of a grudging acceptance, but that works too.
I love how you can see the exact moment the dog is like “oh you’re cool my bad.”
That’s how my girl will be before and after she has food
when you are dealing with overreacting people lol
Shibby
My dog watched this and died on the floor... just laying there with her eyes under her paws...🤣😂
I love it- but really? Just circle the wrist?

Nope!
Report.
Ok
Stupid question to dog scientists: why is the dog so agitated at first?
Honestly I'd be wearing chain mail.
Worked in a dog grooming shop on and off for half my life. I’ve seen both people and groomers do horrible things to dogs. Groomers have been fired on the spot because of the way they treat dogs. 

You really have to love animals to work in the field.

FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU, WHO ARE YOU?? WHAT'S GOING ON?! FUCK Y... ouu, that actually feels kind of nice. Ok we good.
That bite would’ve been lethal.
From angry boi to good boi
Poor doggo was terrified, looks like he's been needing a good brushing for while now. Not at all surprised he's probably hard to work on
The look he makes Realizing it aint too bad

Wanted what happened leading up to that.  Looked like quite a lot of hair had already been taken before the start.

I’m going to brush your ass first. Now your trust is mine.
Earl Shibe is much angrier than his commercials let on.
Risky one, cant imagine how many the person got bitten by dogs
> tfw you pretend to dislike intimacy and be perfectly fine on your own, but you actually crave affection
I had a dog like this a couple months ago. He was trying to bite the scissors and clippers the same way the Shiba is trying to bite her. He was terrified and frankly, I was too. It was a slow groom with a LOT of patience. He came to see me a few weeks ago, and I was honestly dreading the groom. To my surprise, he was perfect! Some dogs just need to know you're not going to hurt them, and it hurts my heart to wonder why they need that validation.

Nice
Is it possible to learn this power?
The shibe on the inside: “Fine. I have decided to tolerate you human. Pray that my good humour does not fade”.
I have a shiba and they are so much more bark than bite. They make a huge amount of noise but when it comes down to it, they are still just teddy bears.
NO. NO. NONONo-

OH. Oh. ok that's kinda nice
Real skill. I wish everyone was like this.
Is a spooped sheeb
“Huh, that’s actually kind of nice.”
Seent it. Lots.
That must be so satisfying to get a dog to like you look that after they want to night you
Wow. Dedication.
Cute
As someone who pointed this out said when I first saw this video, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS UNLESS YOU ARE A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL AS YOU CAN EASILY GET BIT even if you do everything right.
🐕😓😓😁Good job....
Oh hey that's nice ...
what does it mean when the dog licks its lips / mlems itself during the brushing?
Good boy is a good boy, just misunderstood.
>in less than 60 seconds

Sixty seconds in the clip, sure, but what happened before that?

For all we know, the groomer that the spicy shibe killed is lying in a pool of her own blood, off-camera.
Fuck you fuck you oh never mind your cool
I've seen this before. It makes me sad. What happened to that good boi to make him so angry!?
How did she get the initial hand there to hold the dog in the first place?

Weird.
Nice job!
Don’t you ever try to pet me! I pet myself!
Doggo looks a bit embarrassed at the end.
Our male shiba Miles hates baths. My wife is scared/embarrassed to bring him to a groomer heh. So I just bathe him my self. He screams,  but just just takes it lol.
Me before and after I get fed
The owner is neurotic I bet
I bet she could take down Holly
You really have to have a love for animals to be this good at your job.
Woooooow! 😮
Looks like a typical day at work. There is always one dog that’s very difficult to work with.
I like how the dog is like oh okay lol I’m tripping
Wish this worked the same for people.
"Hey, she's actually not bad."
I love how he’s just HEY DONT YOU DARE HURT ME AHGNMFJXKTNVKGNSOCMTBRRDJDRJR... wait... oh your petting me. Neat.
This is the perfect visual representation of how I am before and after eating.
Careful w di dogo
Who trained this dog? Smh
So fucking talented, God damn. I work with dogs everyday and I aspire to be able to connect with them this easily.
Damn, masterful application of assurance and force to get the job done. \*ovation\*
I was bitten by a dog a few times earlier, a rescue, offered my open palm hand, broke the skin a few times, eventually calmed down
I like when the dog turns its head to the side as if thinking "well look at this, I had nothing to worry about!"
When you lurking for long enough to be able to spot a repost d-_-b
I've never had that problem with any dog I've ever had. They always loved being brushed.
My pug would love this lol
No muzzle she’s a G!
I've found that once you start petting an animal the aggression massively drops. The problem is you usually don't get to pet them without losing a few fingers
Anxiety in a nutshell.
Do the same with a pit bull from the hood
I wonder how she grabbed him with her first hand...
Probably getting paid minimum wage and having crappy hours too, being a groomer occupationally sucks at most places and i feel bad for those truly talented at it because they are often undervalued
"Hmm, not so bad..."
Right hand is gentle and relaxing while left hand is hard as steel
Like a switch turned off. Amazing.
Dog’s face, “I’m sorry. You’re right. This is pretty awesome.”
Doggo just wants petto
Mad skillz
Is "shibe" the doge version of "heeb?"
r/dogelore
"Hey, This isn't so bad..."
"Not all strangers are bad" tell that to 9 year old me when i realised the van didn't have any candy in it
I want this ability
Bless them they’re not the brightest
The sad thing is, her hand is in a position that looks like she’s going to backhand the dog. Based on the dog’s reaction, he seems to recognize this hand signal as if he’s been hit regularly.

sick animal or caregiver?
Well,maybe if she didn't raise the back of her hand? It seems pretty obvious s/he is scared of getting hit.
That is impressive as all fuck.
He’s like “FUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYIUFUCKYOOOOOOOUUUUUUUOOOOOHHH THIS FEELS NICE,PROCEED.”
"well shit this actually isn't that bad*
Angery over 9000! Oh...wait. We good.
oh :( someone definitely did something bad to that dog once :(
This obviously took more than 60 seconds
Expert angery sheeb tamer

DONT TOUCH ME FIEND


ok maybe ur nice
Me overreacting to something out of the ordinary
Why risk it. Just muzzle the damn dog.
He keeps getting mad again every 60 sec
Talk about a liability
Good doggo
I need subtitles for him/her!
Why are Shibas super aggressive??
Less than 30 I think...
What a good boi. And also what a good vet.
It was better seeing it the 4th time around.
She's using a Furminator, likely he didn't like how it felt, or his pet parents used one on him and were too rough or did it too long, so he's scared of it. Be careful with a Furminator of you use it!
Turn down for what?
Oh, ya... that.. 
Never mind, carry on.
I would be a shit dog owner. Honestly if I had one Cesar would come by and say. " Relax homes, you're tripping out your dog with your stance. Nooo don't look at it. It hates when you look at it. Noo don't pet it. The dog need more boundaries and strict  commandos eh. No you're scaring the dog with the pitch of it voice. You need to change your attitude and be more like me oke.
General reposti
Aww? That dog has some pretty shitty aggression issues. Shitty owners
"Oh, is that all you want to do? Well, I guess that is kinda nice."
I tried this once and the dog’s owner told me I was trespassing.
What's that? A pet? Proceed thanks
but this is my cat when i dont feed her at 5 in the morning tho
"Oh you wanna pet me? Shit negro, that's all you had to say!"
At the end he was like "huh that wasn't that bad wasn't it?"
Fuck that.
He A M G E R Y
I was afraid for that lady.  Mega brave, I would be out the doooooooor.........
@Tonybakercomedy did an excellent voiceover of this event on instagram. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
Dogecoin
Don’t insult this pupper
Doggo is thinking “hey..I actually kind of like how this feels..”
His face show realization of "Am i the asshole?"
That's amazing!
Haha so adorable
Wow
You...you..Should have gone for the head.
She didn't even have to whisper...
YOU MUST COMPLY.
Dogs love us too much. Can't hate for long.
Reminds me of the Hope For Paws rescue videos. Dog with a broken leg snarling and snapping, dude is all Hey that's *not nice*... Doggo gets snared, bites at snare, slowly calms down and happily jumps in their car and gets leg fixed and adopted. So happy.
Mine must read with his butt then.
It would be better if the dog didn't seem distracted at the point where it stopped snapping at the groomer.
That lady could provide my parents some lessons about their bratty dog.
Repost from a few days ago. Really?
This guy rocks it.  Congrats
Wow... she is the dog whisperer.
I do this when I brush my niece's hair minus the butt pats
He says ok then...this is not so bad...
Good doggin
Braver than I will ever be.
The trust doesn’t always last when you turn the water on.
What the fuck is going on in this thread.
HEY!>NO!>NO!!>NO!>OOo>oo>ooh ya
Fuck that furry barking liability. Who’d put someone they that? Fuck the money.
Me before and after coffee in the morning
This gets reposted every month
Imagine if people became friends by scratching each other’s butts...
