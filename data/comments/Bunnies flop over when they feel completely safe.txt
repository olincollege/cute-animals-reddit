I love the dog‚Äôs chill energy the whole time, just patiently waiting while the bunny does their thing.I would classify that as a partial barrel roll as the bunny was fully committed and threw itself over lol!Omg the way the dog puts his head just close enough to snuggle the bunnyAwwww my godI'm so in love. They need their own page I can follow....Those spastic hops (called binkies) are also an expression of joy


Edit: Wow! My karma pretty much doubled from one comment. Maybe I can add to it by letting Reddit know my wife and I have two rabbits ourselves. 
They are named Iris and Henry Winkler.

Edit2: Alright, since y‚Äôall asked for it, here are the little fur babies: https://imgur.com/gallery/gNYBswj

Iris is the gray one. Henry is the orange one. He is the biggest cuddle bug. She is adorable but has quite the attitude. She‚Äôs my beelzebunny.I thought it was called "popcorning" or is that just with Guinea pigs?Omgü•∞ They are so cute & FLUFFY! What sweetness.I want to see a bunny doing backflips so badThe pup is gorgeous.Legosi and haruCuteHave bunny. Can confirm that it is extremely adorable.

Although my bun likes to aggressively flop against my closet, which rattles the doors, which spooks me depending on what tine on night he decided to do it. Stupid o' clock and fuckthisshit o' clock seem to be his favorite hours to raise hell.Painfully cuteThere is just something universally heartwarming about animals of different species cuddling with eachotherBunny: happy! Happy!

Dog: hey. Time to settle down and nap.

Bunny:......... 'Kay! (Flop)

Dog: you're lucky you're adorable.Be still, my heartQuestion: can bunnies be potty-trained?Bunnies are cuter than kittens. Fight me.I love how the dog puts its nose to the bun like: ‚Äúnap time?‚Äù

Then rests its head close to the bun like: ‚Äúnap time :)‚ÄùHow do we know stuff like this?Oh the flop! The love between these two is unbelievable. Melts my heart.I really needed this tonight (today). I have  funeral to attend Thursday I'm not prepared for and this helped make it betterIs there a subreddit only for bunnies flopping over ?Animal version of MadTv: Look what I can do! *jump spasms*I‚Äôm once again asking for your carrot. - Bunny SandersNap time!He hops like an idiot and I love him very much.My brothers rabbit does this all the time when I look after him, thought he was having a seizure when he first did it!/u/VredditDownloaderdog: leave me alone
bunny: play with me
üòÇWow. That dog really loves George!  
So cute!Awwww, he's all hopped outMy cats do this too. Hopefully it means the same thing and not that they‚Äôre drunk or somethingMy dog flop over me when i come back home , like he say : oh , finally you comeback , now i want go out for pee and after that i want a big meat , ha haBunny SandersI would have tried to give you an award but I have no coins because I‚Äôm newThis is some kawaii-ass shit.Also I don't think they do bouncing like that which is known as "popcorning" which is similar to what guinea pigs do. Basically rabbits and guinea pigs do that type of hopping when they are happy. If the rabbit was scared it would be at the other end of the room. Very cool that your pets have a good friendship going. Must be a super chill doggo since its just vibing when the bunny almost kicks it in the head accidentally. And the fact that it just nuzzles into the rabbit is adorable, lol.Awww!This much cuteness should be illegalThe akita is a majestic beast.Oh the cuddle at the end got me.u/vredditdownloaderI'm surprised the Shiba is ok with this. They tend to have strong prey drives.I hop, hop, and hop again.

I flop down next to my best frenI‚Äôm dying of aww with all those binkies. She reminds me of my Lorelei who passed away last month. I have excellent memories of her daily binkies and her rambunctious shenanigans.

I hope my new bunny will be full of happiness like that little guy.Just got this post from 99.9k to 100k, it deserves itAdorable. People who continue to wear coats or hats made from rabbit fur should watch this and maybe they will stop.I want to feel this way too&#x200B;

This bunny is trying to play/sport with the dog, that little stomp on the face was no accident, lol. Then just happily chills out into bunny flops when the dog doesn't respond.My great grandfather had a pet rabbit named Henry,and when he tied his tie for work in front of the full length mirror in his bedroom,Henry would always stand strait up next to him and stare at my grandfather in the mirror.My brothers rabbit does this all the time when I look after him, thought he was having a seizure when he first did it!I approve of rabbit zoomies.It‚Äôs like he tests the dogs patience to see if if it‚Äôs a threatThe dog looks like hachikoThe dog is like "you're a complete spaz but yet my fwen."[hmmmmmmmmm](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9i6cxp/bunnies_only_flop_over_like_that_when_they_feel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)awwww cuteThat little flop!Its so cute im gonna cry!Woah, your rabbit jumps! Mine was too fat.Those glowing eyes look so evil lolThere‚Äôs going to be rabbit shit all over that bed.I'm impressed he didnt shit your bed. 
All the rabbits I know are basically a poop walking machine.holy shit that white mane

you have a Bernie Sanders bunnyHappy hops !My sister's pet bun used to do this to me all the time, and it made my heart happy every time. Bunnyloaf~Doggo : WTF you just hit my head with your butt.

Rabbit : I'm so happy!

Doggo : *nevermind I'm too chill for this.Love the Binks!!!My daughter's bunny does this. I had never seen one do it before her, and we just thought she was a bit weird. Great to know she just feels safe!That bunny has really low PINGLil dude looking like Bunny Sanders with his scraggly white hairI love bunnies and we tried to have a indoor pet bunny. But good lord the that cute little guy shit all over the place. Tried the litter box training with no luck. Any pointers?BeastarsI'm trying to sleep here!That‚Äôs it....this might be the cute that finally kills meHELLO RTGAME FANS!!Here from RT streamu/Gintoki-desu us? üòÜAkita‚Äôs make anyone feel safePlease let the bunny‚Äôs name be Peppy!TIL my dog is actually a bunny, when she lays down in my room she just side flops down. It's cute until you have 70 lbs of dead weight landing on you.I love how the dog is just like, "don't mind my dude, he's just trying to get comfy."I think its called popcorning... Guinea pigs do the same thing. My heartI feel like that dog gave so few fucks and just wanted to snuggle.

Bunny: hop oh fuck a dog! Hop oh shit still dogo.

Dogo: Carl you fuckin do this every...

Bunny: OH SHIT A DOG

Dogo: Carl you real...

Bunny: ahhhhhhh a dogo.

....

Bunny: just messing Steve I know it‚Äôs you. Roles over."You are weird doggo, but I still loves you"The flop is very cute, but the dog snuggling up next to the bunny after made me aww out loud. So adorable.The thing i love about it is how the dog moves its head closer to the bunny afterYeah that bunny super trusts the dog or it wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere close. The random hops beforehand are also something rabbits do when they‚Äôre happy. This rabbit would not survive for a day in the wild.That cuddle though. But for real, my step mom saw a wild rabbit lie down on his side once and it freaked her out a bit. It took a few explanations to under stand what she ment.
‚ÄúNo it just laid down on the side walk.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell if their sitting or crouching...‚Äù
‚ÄúNo it honestly LAID DOWN on its side.‚Äù
‚Äú...Was it dead?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo! It just laid on its side, just like a cat or dog does when they find a sunny spot on the floor.‚Äù
‚ÄúWait... rabbits can do that?!‚ÄùDog: I'll allow it.They also do it when the nut, But ONLY when they nut on target. True fact. They often "miss" and just splash on the females fur but if they do it inside they roll over.

My neighbors bunny lived in a very small cage, fed only dog food, never played with, no water, and had no toys, it constantly shook in fear, amd it got so bad he ripped out his fur from stress. I had to call animal services to get him to a shelter and we adopted him when we moved to the next town over! He died last year and we have a memorial for him in the kitchen with his favorite toys and his favorite food. I still miss Magnolia. Rip Magnolia 2017 - 2019.

Wonder how long they've been socialized together or if I just have a more vicious pup.They also do it when they die.Why does this reddit allow reposts? I mean i understand it is hard to remove all reposts but come on, reposts of the ones that already has a ton of carma can be removed

Chill! Finally! Good little!Lol the dog looks cheesed off lolI need a bunny in my life.My heart...Our Chinchillas would do something similar, although their reflex was to jog over and then jump-kick rebounding off the wall. We'd let them run around a spare room with all the doors closed and wires/boxes off the ground so there was nothing to chew that we couldn't see.  

The males would sometimes get so happy they'd start running in a circle around the room, literally rebounding off all 4 walls gaining speed as they ran around for fun, although that was more of a "Chinchilla Zoomies" haha that was a rare occasion.  The single wall-kick hop similar to this bunny was much more common for our group of chinsYou are braver than me.

Wonder how long they've been socialized together or if I just have a more vicious pup.This generally happens with animals as a submissive display to a predator, doesn't it?That rabbit probably dropped 25 turds during that 30 second video.Zootopia was realMy day is better
