Samoyeds are so beautiful
My post lunch workday. 
He must be in a meeting.
The cloud is having technical difficulties
[deleted]
Can anyone tell me what breed this is? Googling "cloud dog" was inconclusive 
You thought I was sleeping?

Acting.
Of course when a dog does it, it's cute. [But when I do it](http://gfycat.com/meatycaninedeviltasmanian), it's a formal discussion with my boss.
That's like a more majestic version of me throughout all of junior high, high school, and college.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt falling asleep! Just resting my eyes‚Äù
"Huh, what just happened?"
Every bit adorable.
Got to work an hour ago and that's currently me at my desk. Thankfully I can close my office door and no one will be the wiser when my head eventually slams against my keyboard. 
Zzzz^z^z "Pls don't tell"
This is me at work today...
Sleepy cloud
How did u get a cloud in your house?!
Let the good boy shleep
"Why did you push me?"
He looks dog tired. 
Floof.exe is not responding, opens task manager... wait it‚Äôs back!
Anyone else worried about that corner on the coffee table?
I don't wanna close my eyes.

I don't wanna fall asleep,

'Cause I'd miss you, human

And I don't wanna miss a treat!
I love how they always look at you like you must have pushed him over or something. 
Groggy Doggy
That's one majestic dog.
Omg!!!! Want to snuggle the floof!
‚ÄúI will not fail my master! I will not!‚Äù
Is there a subreddit specifically for animals slowly nodding off and falling over?
Had no idea sheep sleep sitting up 
7th hour in my office and this is exactly how I feel right now. 
Been there, buddy
My shibe does this when she begs. She sits there and stares so hard her head starts rocking back and forth as it slowly falls down and her eyes close...then she snaps her head back up.
Why don't these guys just lay down?

Must of had a ruff day 
Me in my staff meeting right now...

Samoyeds have to be one of the derpiest dogs put there. I adore the shit out of them and miss owning them but man they can be derpy.
I bet a pregnant woman somewhere started crying because of this gif.
Hahaha nice.
This is so me especially during exam week.
Me whenever I try to read a book with the heat on
Ees okey fren. We nap now. 
I hate when I fall in my dreams and jar myself wide awake

Tired puppy is tired.

Things like this make me miss having a puppy. It was cute watching her figure out how to walk properly and being amazed by her own tail.
"It's so warm and comfortable in here, I'll relax for a... Whoa. Did they see that?... They saw."
When you have to go to work the day after a game you've been waiting for months for comes out.
Damn it, now I want to go home and take a nap with my dogs.

He is luckier than me. I had to study while falling asleep. He doesn't have to do anything.
This makes me sleepy.
when you design your apartment around your dog
Here we witness a dog in a brutal, knock down drag out battle with the most infamous of monsters...

the Z Monster.  You can witness at the half way point that the Z Monster almost lands a *Crushing Blow* that would have soundly defeated this dog, sending it off into the dreaded LaLa Land of deep sleep.
that's a maths class
Narcoleptic Boye?
I'm a simple man, I see a turquoise LACK and I approve!
That look, ‚Äúwho pushed me?‚Äù
You should give him those glasses that make it look like your eyes are open. That'd fool em. 
this may honestly be the most adorable thing ive ever seen
So tired
Aww
This was me on the treadmill after work yesterday
"Wh Who said I was sleeping? I was meditating"
Please don‚Äôt push me 
This was me in class after lunch 
*deep breath* Ok buddy, look around slowly and if i look cute enough they won't remember what just happened.
‚ÄúWho me? I‚Äôm not even tired‚Äù
If i saw my dog doing that, I would Make my bed, put some soft blankets on there, and pick her up and lay her down onto the bed and cover her with blankets. Dogs are awesome. 
Why is it always so warm in the meeting room? 
What kind of dog is it?
Is this a trait of Spitz breeds ? My Shiba Inu has done this since he was a pup all the other dogs I have had just lay down and sleep. 
"Hah. Acting."

My dog has never done this, he'll just lay down anywhere and pass out
Just lay down buddy. You deserve it for being such a goodboye.
AHa!  Lay down, dummy!  
He's like... y'all are boring me to sleep here! Where are the Woofing beotches..? :P
Put him tO BED YOU MONSTER
I guess this explains why this months sales numbers are all bark and no bite
What breed is your dog? He looks like mine, that I have always considered a mutt. 
Is it hard to keep a Samoyd reasonably clean?

I am very familiar with Northern breeds and social/exercise requirements, but that white coat makes me reluctant to consider the breed.
His 1-2 crossover paw work was top notch.

Edit: or her
The wake up face is like 'so you were just going to keep watching me?'
I think he is a liar! It‚Äôs entirely pawsibble that he *is* sleeping on the job! Not that I‚Äôve ever done that. That would be dogpicable! 
I found my boyfriend‚Äôs spirit animal ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Had one dog with a long neck, would start falling asleep like that, while sitting. Head would bobble around, increasing momentum. As she started to sway, would wake up, pause and start process all over. 
r/eyebleach
Oh dat little face!

This is me on the drive home from work.  I have a one-hour commute and I always start to feel myself drifting off.  I know its not safe, but I have a hard time keeping myself awake.

There was an imbalance in the force and he was clearly disturbed by it
I opened the reddit app on the toilet, shut my eyes as it loaded. I had no sleep last night. I almost dropped off, then I open my eyes to this post, of course. Why mother.
Cute 
I love the look on his face afterwards haha
so cute
On a side note, why does riding the bus and tube make one so fucking sleepy? Like before entering them you were alert and fresh, the moment you sit down and ride a bit, a sleepiness overcomes you. WTF?

Cloud doggo needs rests.
My first dog will definitely be a Samoyed :D
Thats how everytime i  mediate and end up falling asleep.
Reminds me of a doggo I met while on vacation as a kid. The place we stayed had a couple of house dogs and one was severely abused as a puppy before being adopted by the owner we stayed with. As a result he would never lie down to sleep. He always fell asleep standing up and then would fall on his face after a few minutes. We felt so bad for the poor guy, but towards the end of our week long stay he had become so comfortable with us that he started to lay down to nap! It made 10 year old me so happy to see that.
This reminds me of my cousins dog, who is the same breed. His name is Celsius and is a very good boye :)
Is this in an IKEA store?
My dog is clever enough to be on the couch when he starts to drift off
So cutee i want oneT^T

Majestic sleepy doggo.
My aunt's cat was doing the same thing this morning except that she was on her little perch and almost fell off. Must be nice being that cat, sucks away the warmth of it's humans body at night, then sleeps in the sunlight all day.

What a beautiful dog
My cat does this. I have no idea how he can be tired after 18 hours of naps, and somehow doesn‚Äôt need to rest his head to sleep either. 
Cute
He's got that Bill Murray glance going on when he wakes up. 
This is a happy, warm dog with a full tummy who has been well exercised.

I think this is actually falling awake
2 secs into sleep mode and he gives you that look
