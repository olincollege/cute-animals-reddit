The way it keeps looking up to the handler... so sweet!  I love how gentle the handler is as well with the little guy.  Many thanks for sharing - this made my day.
"Please don't leave me, Jeff. I'm not sure about this yet."
The way it keeps looking up for reassurance is so wholesome, thanks for sharing!
Ohh. It’s like the air, but.. thicker.

My feet make sense! My feet make sense!
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
I wouldn't have been able to resist kissing that sweet little nose every time they looked up.
Instinct is a hell-uv a thing!
Something tells me that this guy's job is incredibly fulfilling
I am certain that there are adorable little baby seal squeals and chirps happening in this video and it is absolutely criminal that it's not included.
Never realized how floofy a dry seal is.
meanwhile mom would be like *punt* in ya go

Those big Disney eyes constantly looking up for reassurance, if this doesn't warm your heart you seriously don't have one.
I love the fact that everything the guy did shows that not only has he done this before, he's done it enough to know exactly where to put his hands and when it's safe to let go.  Like, there isn't exactly a tutorial on this so this guy has probably taught dozens of baby seals to swim.
Where can I sign up to do this?
They really are the doggos of the sea. So cute I can't even handle it.
So gentle with the animal.
Frodo Baggins: What are we holding on to, Sam?  
  
Samwise Gamgee: That there’s some good in this world, Mr Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.

\*scene shifts to baby seal\*
I thought that was a Maltese
I love how gentle he was with the little dude.
"You won't let me go, won't you?"
That seal was bred at the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan in Japan. This isn't the first time it's been introduced to water, but likely the first time it's been put in a pool large enough for it to sort of swim in.

Their [official channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/OsakaKaiyukan/videos) has a lot of videos of this seal. There's a cute video of them [dunking the little guy in water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ95Lh2s1F0) to get their flippers ready.
“Is he baptizing his dog?!”

-my wife
This would be my dream job if I could do this all day
Those big trusting eyes. "What is happening, human friend?"
Puppies grow into their big ears and paws. Apparently baby seals grow into their big eyes!
Konene!
God, she had that look in her eyes, full of trust in the man who held her.
Like a duck, erm…seal to water.
Don't drown me Please.....
Good lord, I'm a 39 y/o man and this shit makes me want to cry. So much good out there, when all we're fed these days is bad. My God, that face....so perfect.
That face is adorable. So nervous and looking to the human for reassurance.
That's so heart-melting!
Hard to know what to hold on to
*types through my tears* 

m-mermaid puppy
So these little guys killed Bin Laden?
OH MY GOD IT IS SO FLUFFY
Warning: Don’t google what they do to baby seals in Canada every year.
It knows exactly how to seal once it hits the water. So cool.
They should name it Nene.
Does anybody else grind their teeth together at something super cute??
Going for a swim at Club Seal I see.
“Am I — 

Is this — 

Am I supposed to…?

Oh yeah no I got it, that feels nice”
That guy is so patient and careful with him. I love that.
🥲
Weird lookin dog
That moment when you realize the marshmallow floats.
Aquatic hamster dogs DO exist!
Aaaww. This sub makes me feel all warm and fluffy everyday.its just beautiful 😍
Wow this made me a bit emotional! Such a cute seal and what a gentle kind handler!
I feel like a dummy for never thinking of putting my hand beneath head to keep above water (like with my dog). Heh.
TIL that baby harp seals are born with fur.
I love the look he gives.. are you sure this is okay human
Floofy water doggo.
Someone should write a scientific paper on the evolutionary trait of big eyes in the young of all mammal species and how it makes it impossible to say no to them and makes you want to pet them and snuggle them.
I would absolutely love to have a job like this. I'd never have to work another day in my life.
Could that seal be any friggin cuter?
Here I was thinking this just came right away to them, guess all babies gotta learn.
The way he dangles as he’s passed over is adorable!
a little water puppy 😩💞
I’m crying it’s like a puppy mixed with an otter and a baby
Repost
He took to that like a seal to water
This video was an hour too short.
Maybe I'm stupid but how does a baby seal not get born into the water?
I love when the little flipper instincts gradually kick in.
Imagine being that seal. Thinking how fucking stupid you are because it's difficult to get around on land, and then discovering that you were actual made for water and mobility goes from a 2 to a 10, and the amount of happiness that must bring.
This is not cute! Why does a baby seal gets introduced to water for the first time by a human????
Aww that seal is so cute! It would make a beautiful pair of slippers. 



I'm jk I am completely against animal cruelty!
Sir, that's a dog.
Will say I didn’t introduce my kid to water as this dude did to this seal… he got the good old “I’ll catch you” followed by the immediate touch bottom and gulp of water
I love how he's all scared but then realizes he's actually a fish
That’s the sweetest face ever
So cute she looked frightened first but then she was like 'ohh thats cool'. So wholesome
Didn’t realise they are such adorable little fur balls
This creature has to be the cutest thing in existence.
**seal of approval**
A bath before it goes out  clubbing.
p u r e
Seals just looking at the Chinese dude like yo I got this just let me go I’m a seal son I know how to swim and navigate the seas by the stars my man
That look: „ Are you sure that’s how it is supposed to be? I doubt, I highly doubt. Just so you know, I was completely fine being dry and on land.“
Sooo where do I sign up for this job? 😍
daily serotonin boost right here
Thanks for making me realise three decades into life what job I actually need 🥺
You mustn't swim till you're six weeks old, 
Or your head will be sunk by your heels; 
And summer gales and Killer Whales 
Are bad for baby seals. 
Are bad for baby seals, dear rat, 
As bad as bad can be. 
But splash and grow strong, 
And you can't be wrong, 
Child of the Open Sea!
- Rudyard Kipling
That moment when it realizes it floats. So cute!
This is why the wholesome award is a seal
I see this is the new morsel for karma farming.
He is a natural
Are those feet?
I’m handing in my notice tomorrow and flying to wherever this is to work here!
He’s so floofy!!! My heart just exploded...
Wait until he gets used to it, you won't be able to get him out.
It's the baby seal from the Osaka Aquarium!
I’m floating!!!
There is absolutely nothing cuter on this planet than a baby seal.
Wait, why is it so FUZZY? 😍😭😍😭
u/lonelydustmite
I wish this had sound so I could hear what dirty joke Vince Masuka said as he was handed the baby seal
This is the cutest creature I have ever seen
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Why does it look like a toddler wearing a Halloween costume?
The guy was so sweet & the seals eyes are so big!
This is the kind of care and patience I need with my next swim instructor
The og video has 800 dislikes,Who would dislike this
u/urfavefilipina
This ends too soon
The video wasn't long enough
Like an adorable fuzzy fish
I wonder why they don’t stay this color and is as furry when they become an adult.
Wait, I’m a water type?!
So these things killed bin laden... Impressive
Poor baby seals 🥺 gonna be one of the next species to go with climate change 😭😭😭
Massive eyes
I can’t handle such cuteness 😍😍😍
Seal just looks him in the eyes like "you wont let go right?"
This looks like an awesome job to have
" this really does feel like a killing-me kind of a room".
Is it medically possible to die because something is too cute to cope with?
Reminds me of Turn A Gundam when Sochie learns that the dumpy and awkward Kapool she's been using on land thrives in underwater combat, which it was designed for.
I didn’t realize seals could get COVID
Oooh... I wish the video was longer
OMG, I am in love 🥰. It’s so cute!
The fact that this had no sound made me rage.... i NEED to hear that seal with all my heart👺
well that's the cutest thing in the history of the internet
Alright you cute furry shrimp, this is how you swim.
What kind of job let's me do this, with any animals

I just want to help animals out
If I could get the job of introducing baby seals to water for the first time, I think I could finally be happy.
Splash some water on his balls first so he doesn’t go into shock!
Cuts off too soon...
That baby seal looks like if someone attached fins to a puppy.
Meanwhile mother seals push them in and go grab lunch. If they figured it out they split lunch. If not than I guess she’ll be eating for two again.
Awww wish we could have seen first swim too! 🥺 how unbelievably cute!!!
Have you ever heard the joke about a baby seal that walks in to a club
He's so fluffy and keeps checking the keeper is still there 🥺 So cute
'Yo Ricky,what is that?
Yo,wtf is happening Ricky?
Yo yo yo man,whaaat?'
Bro baby seals are so insanely fucking cute. I remember at my shitty old job, I’d just look at pictures of them to try and get some kind of happiness while I was there
That back flipper sculling immediately, like a baby bird taking flight, so instinctual.
Wait- seals are fluffy? This brings a whole new meaning to my life
I can’t tell if this rehabilitation center is Japanese or Korean. I’m presuming the former.
This is literally my dog every time we put her in for a bath.
Ooouuuu swimming fur-dog
First time introduced to water ? Must have been really thirsty up to that point
Omg I’ve never seen a fluffy seal
“That’s a cat.”
“……oh”
That pool REALLY needs to be cleaned.
Omg, that looks so cute! I remember when my lab started to swim in the pool for the first time. He was really happy to see so much water!
UM OKKKKK
I almost can't take this! Too. much. cute.
This is too wholesome 🥺
I need to have a serious talk with my guidance counselor
The amount of cute in this vid is too damn high!
Ummm...can I have this job?????
This is sealiously the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
We ain’t gonna talk about the nice little 3 foot Asian man
Hello yes I’d like to apply for this job. No need to pay me and yes I’ll work overtime.
It’s like a club for baby seals.
It’s like a dog!
TIL: Orcas are heartless creatures
Best baptism ever
Oh my goodness!  You're made for water!  Your feet and hands are flippers little sweety!
"Dude, trust me, *you* are gonna love this stuff."
...and now I want a pet seal...
My heart can’t take it. Oh my god.
I just wanna hug it
It’s little face 🥺😩😭
I want to hug the life out of it now.
Why are the eyes so frickin huge?
Seal: it's like I was *made* for this!
And you wanna tell me that *those* took down bin laden?

Ye no fuckin' way im believing that shit.
So freaking sweet, I really appreciate your sharing this.
I hope they never get separated. They’ve imprinted with how she/he looks up to the Trainer for reassurance.
She is a natural
u/savethevideo
It’s… it’s…. It’s so… it’s so *CUTE*!!!
Awhhh nene was so cute when she was a baby
The last time I saw this the person didn’t get that many awards..I don’t think?
Any other Canadians get the ol familiar urge?
Is it just me or did the lil bean crack a smile at the end when he started to swim? 🥺🤍
“I got dis lemme alone.”
u can see the exact moment he gets it like "hmm ig this ok, youre holding me--- wait. this DOPE"
Dream job!
..and now my heart is full.
I love to look up , you want me to what ?
Floofy af! 😍
Cute
Adorable !
Why do they look so cute starting out but then just turn into big fat stooges?
Floofy baby.
I am tearing up this is SO CUTE
Want to see more!
I need this in 8k
I hate that the area I live in is one of those places that brutally hunt baby seals for there fur. It's so disgracefull and I'm ashamed in the other people around me.
Im crying
Search for Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan on YouTube. They have a series of videos on this sea Pupper growing up.
i want to pet one

Edit: i NEED to pet one
😂This is more gentle than how i was taught to swim, by being thrown into the pool.
Welp… I finally know what line of work I need to be in
Best eye bleach I’ve seen today!
Why is him in capricity?
I love this ocean puppy
sweet trusting water pupper
This is the awwwww moment
At first glance I thought that was a giant baby in the tub
I’m crying tears of wholesome
Omg it’s sooooo cute!!!!!!!
I'm not crying, you're crying.
The absolute CARE and gentleness this man has with this little behbeh is huge, so so much love from him to the little one.
And the little one looking up for reassurance and trusting him and knowing he's safe and not being put into any harm....

This is so sweet it makes my heart ache. <3
But how cute is it when he raises his head and looks into the eyes of the man yffddfghjuyffvbju
Are you sure this water's sanitary?
and this is 1min of this same baby seal sleeping. Watching with caution to your heart. 
https://youtu.be/oEg706rzCRw
So many baby animals are so cute but not all species keep that cuteness. Like hippos. Grown hippos are scary as hell. Especially when they are in water. THEY RUN UNDERWATER
Ah I remember that "I think I will drown now. PLEASE SAVE ME >~<" look when I was first introduced to water.
Pretty sure the seal is saying "put me fking down already, i was genetically coded to swim since day 1 and long before you werr even conceived"
“What did you put me in peasant?”
This is the most cuteehddjdh video i've ever seen. Aaaaaa the eyes of this seal, the way it's looking at this man. AaaaaaaaaaAAAA
Normaly i am not that kind of person that says 'aww my god, soooo cute' but omg, these eye, the zoom on it's face, *perfection*
In the wild, how do they live?

What age do they go into the water?
What is your job?  
- i make sure the seals don’t drown.
Like a lifeguard but for marine mammals.
How do I upvote twice
I didn‘t know i needed this. Ty 🥺
Instinct is fucking fascinating
❤️🥰🤩
I feel the same way about life everyday haaa
Self actualisation level up!
Did anyone notice 'e peed at first? And the caretaker is like "okay sure, but you're suppose to do something else, can you figure out what?"
This was great to see!
u/fionn112
I imagine the little guy’s like “wait what is thi— ohhhhh this makes sense”
So awww inspering
I could see the baby seal smile at the end
Not to be dramatic but i would die for this animal
This wouldn't be the baby's first time in the water, the keepers would start in a shallow pool. But this might be his first time in deep water.
What is that, an abominable seal?
Finally, a perfect use for my wholesome award.
This seal has been introduced about 10 times already this week.
[deleted]
#**it's clubbing time**
Stop clubbing baby seals
And this video has been introduced to the subreddit not for the first time.
How closely related are seals and dogs? He looks like a puppy
Took that seal 20 seconds to learn to swim took me 20 years
He took to that like a seal does to water.

Wait a min....
Too many of those kids go out to the club instead of taking a wholesome swim like this.
What happens if it doesn’t like water O_O?
Why don't they just drop that sucker in its a seal that's what they do as babies jump in.  people always humanizing creatures.
Are you sure this waters sanitary? It looks questionable to me.
Does anyone know the background of this...that tiny tank is kind of depressing me...
I love baby seals he is so adorable, not sure why Canadians like beating them with clubs but they certainly never deserved that.
But it looks like china so they are probably going to butcher it on the sidewalk hang it up and sell it
Bruh, let my seal pup go, he'll handle himself in that water
Look at this cute baby phoque with this ugly motherphoqua
They taste amazing with some aromat and only because they give such a good energy boost for the Greenlandic fjell. I miss Greenland
So so sweet.
Oh my god it's so small 😭
Took to it like a seal to water
The cutest little chonk 🥺❤️❤️

7/10 it’s alright
Nobody? Okay then:
Where do I buy a baby seal that stays a baby forever?
I'd club that baby seal to get a better deal...
This ended several hours too soon.
IT’S SO FLUFFY!!!
Can we not wait like more than a week before reposting?
“Don’t let me go. Please. I’m scared.”
This animal is not real
Anyone else that grew up Baptist, does this remind you of something?
Soooo Cute♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
That little goofy grin at the end...
This is it, I’m ready to die now I’ve seen everything good.
So much r/nononoyes in this!
Ya I'm going to need the full video of this. T
Well that was the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
Them
water pandas
S3AL looks up to Bob like... “yo Bob, I trust in you dear friend, I trust in you.”
Omg that’s to cute
That ended entirely way too soon
Dammmmm I love this sub
Where is this? How was it living previously without seeing water?
good floofy bean.
You were built for this shit!
I need a new job!!!
Reddit moment
Omg! That is the cutest thing I have seen all day!
😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
Free all animals!!
Looket them floppy tootsies
He is afraid, he knows life will happen to him now on
That face Is cute = 100
Man, he took to that water like a........ seal!
Really beautiful, the care, bond and trust is really touching
How do I get this job
Find someone who looks at you the way that baby seal looks at him.
THIS IS THE BEST THING IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
Is this real? Can humans really be like this towards animals? This is the most uplifting thing I’ve have EVER seen 😭😭😭
Why is it in captivity? Did the mom die?
I'm crying
40 secs of this guy holding the thing to watch it swim for 2 secs
"Oh THAT is why my feet suck"
Awwww 😊
Can we just genetically engineer a seal to stay fluffy forever. That would be cute.
 4:52 pm
Likes knife through butter
Nene never swam before?
My heart!
"Oh, well this is much easier than flopping about on the ground, isn't it?"
I'm not strong enough to stand this level of cuteness.
That’s what I call a seal of approval
Want
I spent longer than I should have thinking this was a pug
I just want to cuddle a swimmy dog!
It's so cute. Seals really are sea dogs ❤️
I wanna quit my job and do this instead
That is one thicc ass!
Why'd they take their time putting it in though? 


Animals know what to do from the get go. They don't learn to swim. They know to swim.
Ended to soon!☹️☹️
Ended too soon!!
I need to see more asap
It looks like this baby has no idea what happens arround. I love the way he is looking around, that is really cute!
Sea puppys are the best
My father just threw me in the first time
how adorable
Sweet Jesus that’s cute
I don't mean to put human emotions onto animals but it's almost like he looks up at him like "Dad I'm scared is this ok" and by the end he's like " haha look at this dude i swim better than he ever could who knew!"
Adorable. Reminded me when I am bathing my little dog!
Happy water pupper!
Thank you so much! Best video I’ve watched today hands down!
I wish someone just held my head up while I figured out buoyancy so I too could learn how to swim.
Sound pleeeaase 😭😭
/r/seals
Beautiful floof.
Ok hey this ain’t so bad
I really appreciate how gentle the guy is with this sea pup, instead of just plopping it in the water
Seals are furry mermaids
This may be the cutest thing I’ll ever see in my lifetime.
More!!!
You promise you got me 🥺
He a floooooooofer
my heart
Now he’s the best buoyant boui
It looks so similar so my baby Eddie dog when he was a puppy it makes me cry
Sea pupper.
I really needed this today
My heart can’t take the cuteness
This is so cute, I might cry.
Omg when he got used to the water he smiled.

Shut up, I'm going to pretend it was a smile.
this made my day
Seal? Nah I think u mean water dog
Such sweet wholesomeness was much needed today! You can tell the baby was nervous, but absolutely trusted his caretaker. So very adorable!
Awwwww 🥰
is this cold water? :(
I like how he uses his flippers and is like “wow these work exceptionally well.”
wonderful!
!save
The tail swish at the end makes me feel happiness I no longer posses
Paro
I can’t deal with this much cuteness ☹️🥰🥰
This is what I want to be when I grow up.
It what it would take me to return to the workforce.
This is the best thing I have ever seen in my life. When I worked with seal rescue, they were smelly aggressive arseholes 😂
omg i can’t 😭
I thought they already had experience water when in their mom
It is probably wondering when Chewbacca will swoop in for the rescue
It’s all true, you were created to eat cement
This is grossly awesome. I know I should never own one but holy shit, I’ve never wanted something more
How do I apply for this job ?
Geyattt dayummmm that’s cute!
Is it possible to overdose on cuteness?!
What do I need to do to get a job doing this
Why don't they just let the mother handle this?
So Cute!!!!! Brings a smile on my face!!!!
Why are little animals so fucking cute
I want this job! How do I get this job???
Water puppy!!!
It's a MerDoggo
I'm a grown ass man, almost. But still this made me year up because that thing is just so fucking cute.
Jesus fucking Christ that is adorable
The way he crossed his flippers when he got near the water 🥺
*water dog*
This was cute as all hell sheesh! Thanks for sharin
So lovely….
Baby Seal too!
Cutie
Us there a wholesome reason why the seal is growing in captivity?
I love that baby seal
I think about this video all the time 😭
Baby seals are my favorite baby animals
He
water puppy
Omg that thing is super adorable
That is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.
Honestly seals are just sea bourne doggos look at that thing and the fact it looks at hooman for reassurance.
A baby seal looks so different to what I imagined it to be
j
That was a seal I thought it was a fluffy mermaid doh
That was a seal I thought it was a fluffy mermaid doh

Aww. I wished my dad taught me how to swim like this instead of yeeting me from the boat.
God baby seals are so

FUCKING

CUTE
absolutely amazing
omg i love it.
Oh my god and to think that people club these... I can’t even
This was a huge post last week on a different sub!
❤
Oh he likes it. Oh he likes it. Oh look he really likes it. He loves it. Oh look he loves  it.
How completely useless are human babies in comparison? Can't keep their own head upright for like a month or whatever.
This is at the Kaiyuukan in Osaka! By far one of my favorite aquariums in the world. After you enter, you take an escalator to the top of the building, after which you walk down a kilometer long spiral with tanks on either side! Highly recommend if you’re in the area.
Fuck me this is cute!
The cuteness overload made my day all better. 11/10.
It looks like a baby Yeti
When is a baby Seal not cute?
https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/nkuzps/baby_seals_first_time_in_a_deep_pool
Then what happened?!?!?!?
Why did this video end so soon??
Watching the "Going in the water" genes turn on is pretty neat.
The first thing that came to my mind is when I saw the title of the video:

Baby seal, this is water 

Water, this is baby seal. 
Say Hi!!!
Awww that little face
That might be the most adorable thing I've ever seen 😭😭
MY HEART IS EXPLODING WITH LOVE FOR THAT SWEET SEAL!!!
He’s like “oh my god I know what these stupid flippers are for now!”
I just want to play with cute animals for the rest of my life. Please, Jesus? 🥺
The video ended too soon.. Downvote.
Ahhh the video ends too early.... im gonna watch a bunch on YouTube.
Oh my heart ❤️
What a good boy 🥺
I can die happily now 😍
You’re not gonna let go right?
Why is giving swimming lessons to baby seals not a part of my job.

Man I wonder how they do it in the wild, the mama probably be like “alright, time to swim kids” then baby seal be like “huh, what is sw-“ *mama seal nudge baby seal to the ocean with her nose* lol
“What is: jobs I’d volunteer for, Alex?”
Omg the cutest video of something I never imagined to get to see
OMMGG ITS ADORABLEEEE!!!
pretty sure that's a water-pupper
And I was just chucked into the water like fresh chum by my dad.
More please
No no no no no.         Hey I'm pretty good at this!
He’s talking to the seal the whole time like pumping him up! “You can do this! I’m right here. It’s ok”
Cute baby seal turned into navy seal 😎
It looks like the creature on the plane wing in twilight zone

I love how every video of this is the same. Baby seal looking terrified with a "Why have you forsaken me farther" And ending with "this  is better than land!"
So squimshy I love it! 🥰🥰
These baby seal video are karma gold mines, Jerry! Gold mines!
Well, that's the cutest thing I've every seen
So cuteeee
Those eyes 🥺
That’s cute af lol
Man how come every time I see a baby seal I can’t get the image of those seal clubbing videos out of my head
Did it pee a little?
u/riahgor23 if Felix was a seal
Ohh is soo adorable awww a true heart breaker that’s made my day seeing him 🥰🥰 the way he looks around with his eyes awwww least he can swim good for him
Oh my word I didn’t know seals were fluffy 🥺 must have
It’s adorable that it’s so scared but trusts the handler.
Cutest thing I’ve seen all day
You can see the cerebellum firing
Ohhhh my heart is melting. The way the baby seal looks up to make sure everything's okay is just so....cute.
I really wish this had sound.
Beautiful
Me, baby seal: why TF are my feet shaped like this and so poorly adapted to walking around.  Ooooooohoooh water, thank you.
He’s like “dafuq is this?”
How heavy do you think she is?
the way he knows how to swim instinctively is amazing
*sees seal/sea lion going into the water for the first time* that’s the SHIT
This might be the cutest thing I've seen all year
the trust in that face
Water Doggo!
How do I do this as a job???
Mofo's a natural
Awww how very cute.
But eventually I'll get to swim somewhere nicer than this depressing concrete box, right?
awww... you go little guy.. you got it!
Definitely ends too soon!
Keeps looking up waiting for the seal of approval.
OMG is the cutest thing I've seen today
Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,

  And black are the waters that sparkled so green.

The moon, o'er the combers, looks downward to find us

  At rest in the hollows that rustle between.

Where billow meets billow, there soft be thy pillow;

  Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!

The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee

  Asleep in the arms of the slow swinging seas.
Adorable
That's not a baby seal, that's my mate Dave
I wonder what a seal feels like. Probably like a dog but softer.
Hey I've been there! That's the aquarium with the whale sharks. There's a huge U.S. military presence on that island. My brother was stationed there so I had to make the trip out to Japan
“What is wet?”
Now this is quality content
Ends to soon
So gently
That baby looks amazing, so quiet and little. These are the little creatures that we should take care of, love it!
The baby looks at him like “yes sir pls drop me in dis”
Like a duck to water
So what you’re telling me is a Seal is just a water Westie?
Haha it looks like my cat!
Must be so weird to be indoors and in the water. Kinda like a space ship if it were human.
How adorable! How can people hurt these creatures? So beautiful
Oh my god...

it's...

*beautiful...*
That little face. Adorable.
Water puppy
His eyes say no but his body says yes.

Seals will never fail to get an upvote from me
Seals are so cute!
why do baby seals remind me of my dog? when he was a baby i'd introduce things very slowly too and he also looked at me for reassurance at every point but he did amazing, like the seal.
I wish so much this had sound, I can only imagine the man just saying words of encouragement to this lil fur ball
little baby
He looks a bit shocked and pleased at the same time. I hope he will be a great swimmer as all the seals are!
why is this so cute 😍
Oh my goodness!! Just look at those giant eyes!!!  My heart has literally turned into a puddle
What has he been drinking his whole life?
That seal was scared but slowly built up the courage to swim. A wholesome moment.
It’s so crazy how fast he got it. I know it’s instinct but it’s just incredible
Definitely an awwwww moment! <3
Omg stooooooop
Are we sure this isn’t an ewok?
How do I get this job?
Crying! This made me so happy after a rough week
🥺🥺”don’t let me go please”
Oh my GOD
*d i p*
My favorite part was the zoom in.
This was uploaded on Kaiyukan's youtube channel in May. And it's not the first time I see this post. OP uploads this 5hrs ago and gets 400+ awards and 60k upvotes instantly? Seems like bots
Like a papa teaching his baby how to swim for the first time. So fucking cute.
The fact that people club seals makes me want to beat someone
It keeps looking up like 'help' but then it's like, oh i got it!
Okay this is one of the most adorable things I have ever seen
What a quick learner
This is literal cuteness overload.
I like it's moment of 'So this is my existence - in water with someone holding my head up?' before going full seal.
Seals are cute no matter the situation
That is so cute it gave me diabetes.
This is soooooooo precious 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just in the nick of time. This one was almost assimilated into becoming a land dog.
So precious
Don’t mess with the seals, See you later stinky.
Where’s this wet market?
That’s a pokemon
Ok that was cute af
Holy cow
Water floof
Why does the video cut off suddenly, I want to see more.
“Ohhhh so that’s what those fins were for!”
Omfg I want one
What a little snuffle puffins.
So what was seal drinking?
You seeing this shit!
I'm surprised it's as old/big as it is....

Imagine living your first several months in an environment you're completely unsuited for... Only to suddenly be introduced to a place you make sense in.
So much trust in that baby’s eyes! So sweet🥰!
Cute!
That face is so adorable!
Bruv the fins move like legs. This shit is sick
How cute! My 3-month old grandson is not quite as adept as that but he’s working on it!
Water pup

Literally a water puppy.

I LOVE THESE LITTLE CHONKS
“Baby Seal, have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior?”
See that face right there that's why I hate otters if you know you know but don't look it up if you don't want the magic of otters to be spoiled
Man I should have saved my Hugz award for this. Here have this.  🥇 It’s the best that I can do.
I’m in love...with a seal
this is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
Is that a baptise session
Oh Gawd the feelz! Super cute.  I feel really bad about supporting the seal hunt right now.  Think I'm about to get all instropective and deep right now...
He’s at the Osaka aquarium and their YouTube has more vids of this guy
Why is it there?
I have that same feeling when I get into the pool.
Aren't they water creatures?  Don't they know water instinctively??  Well this guy is so cute I would want to introduce him to water..🥰🥰
I guess I would’ve loved to do very good things like this and more because it’s so enriching for the soul
Lol
Omg. I can’t breathe. It’s sooo cute🥺🥺🥺🥺
Nature is beautiful.
