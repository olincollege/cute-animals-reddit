“I’m a suction cup”
Fun facts! Tree frogs like this Morelet’s tree frog are often brightly colored on their bellies to distract or startle predators, but when they sleep they need to camouflage, so they tuck in their feet and hide their bellies. They also have super interesting eyelids, they have two sets, one like ours but the second set is lace-like, with holes that the frog can see out of when they sleep.
One, this is the Most Adorable Thing I've seen all day. Two, he looks happy. Do frogs smile? Did anyone know? Because if he's a happy little comfy friend I think I might die
what a cute gummy fren
This is really cute, I was having a really crappy evening and this made it better
The smooshy little belly ☺️
Everybody loves hypnotoad
I'm curious, is that the extremely-cute-but-you-die-if-you-touch-it kind or the cute-and-you-wont-die-if-you-touch-it kind?
Anybody know what type of frog that is?
FROG LOAF!!!!!
That’s some mighty fine blobbing right there.
Oh my god he looks like a tiny spaceship at the end. Itty bitty flying saucer.
So Precious..🥺
Do your seal impression, no, not that one, the other one smartass.
I had no idea frogs loafed!

The underside low key makes me uncomfortable. Still very cute tho
Little did OP know, this form made him more aero in preparation for the jump
Hims gettin all curled up and comfy 💕
All glory to the hypnotoad!
He's just going to leaf you alone.
I wish I could show this to my grandmother.
This is why I love frogs
Omg! That tummy!
why does it look like a lil ufo lol
He became an UFO Frog
Look again. At the end of the video the frog looks like a snake with its mouth open.
What the frog doin?
(((Comfy)))
I love it, it is forever baby and I must protect.
My heart just exploded
source: @nekogekko on instagram, she does a lot of stuff with her frogs.
Without hurting him I would like to hear what that suction sounds like if you pulled him off.
how. do. they. just. loaf.
Reducing surface area exposed to air?
Omg why is this so gross yet so cute
Frog sploots!
Literally me trying to sleep

I really *REALLY* don't like frogs, or toads. But I can get on board with this guy
He round
I don’t care that it’s not Wednesday, he’s too cute not to updoot 🐸💚
This reminds brings me back to high school and learning about van der waal forces in biology
Their whole bottom side is a suction cup, amazing! I thought it was just their feet! This is so cool.
I was SCUBA diving in Sheelar at Mike Roess Gold Head State Park in FL..back in 1986. I came up from a dive and had a tree frog like this jump onto my diving mask..before I took it off.

I just left it on for a few minutes and commented to my friends about it,,wish digital cameras were a thing back then
r/frogbellies?
At the end it just looks like a severed frog head
This made my day. So cute I can barely look at 'em!
This looks so cute and disturbing at the same time
I lived in a place where tree frogs were common.  I loved it when they hung out on my windows, cute little shits.
That’s my son
Green Bean
I have never found that frog can be cute as heck!
what a distinguished gentleman! yes, very distinguished indeed
Why do frogs do that though? It's so funny and cute
Looks like half a fig
This is the cutest thing in the goddamn world lmao xD
Trypophobia triggered....
Very beautiful, thank you kind frog.
u/farmercurtis I would had this froggo
Same thing happens to me when I sit on a leather chair in the summer.
Oh to be a sentient little suction cup blobbing on a glass wall...
“FUCK YOU! I’M SUCTION CUP MAN! LOOK AT ME GO!”
It's a real life slime.
This is the frog version of a bread-cat.
0 Gravity
Can I boop his nose? Can I/pleeeeeease/ boop him
Maybe a dumb question, but where do they find surfaces flat enough to suction cup to in the wild? A glass-like surface doesn’t seems like something you would encounter in nature too often.
Aaand, I'm a space ship!
What is this cartoon like creature?  Adorable!
I am afraid of these animals but still you are too cute for, o God.😄
Omg I love him/her 🐸❤
When he adjusts his lil baby belly I get a RUSH of dopamine
If suction cup man had a pet frog
They have a reddit just for this, I think it's called frog loaf or something
🥺 𝑜𝑚𝑔.
Cool!
Adorable
But can you lick it?
What do they taste like grilled?
So cute 🥺 I want one

r/curledfeetsies
Daaaawwwwww
Looks like a limpet, from the bottom after it’s fully suctioned on. Would not have guessed that was a frog without the other views. This is very cool!

What is this action behaviorally? Is it getting ready to sleep or hiding or...?
So beautiful, what kind of frog?
Gotta get a quality seal
Frogs are gaskets
Not me screaming at how cute the frog is. Nope.
One thing I miss about my hometown is tree frog season. Just going outside and seeing dozens around my porch light. 
Cool as heck.

***HERMETIC SEAL ACHIEVED***
I do believe that's the most photogenic tree frog I've ever seen... but I'm open to competition
Hello little frog!

You're my friend now and your names "Blep".
Adorable internet blobber. Be careful with giving him too much attention though, he might start thinking about being an "influencer" and end up wasting his life. Would just hate to see that happen to the cute little sucker. If he starts asking about essential oils, you may have gone too far.
It is weird af to me that just because it was a little better where they evolved, that they specifically decided "I'm going to be sticky when wet b/c it's wet all the time." That feels like it's from a whole different but niche world. 

Like how many animals evolved to be everywhere? Is it just humans?
Why is Kirby green now?

Freaky and cute at the same time. That makes me feel funny inside. Lol
Frogs have the biggest visible eyes of any vertebrate.
Frog loaf!!!😍
Oh my goodness 😭
He's an exhibitionist
Thank u little man
I'm Suction Cup Frog. Look at me go!
A loafing frog.
Made my night what a cutie
He looks like he’s getting comfy for a bedtime story, or he wants to hear how your day went. That’s adorable 

Frog probably: “So Shannon” *gets comfy* “how are the girls at the office?”
Awe he’s like one of those mini squishy things
This just made my heart smile
Check it out. Imma Watermelon.
This means Hodle
“Full blobbin”
I wish I could ask Mother Nature why she created such unique creatures
Pardon me while I just turn myself into a suction cup.
So nature doesn't really have a lot of glass-type things, does it normally suction like this to rocks instead? I'd imagine it wouldn't be so comfy to do this on a tree.
I never even knew that frogs could be **this** cute…
Frogs are my favorite animal because they go boing and ribbit.

This officially takes the cake for the most ADORABLE frog I have ever seen in my entire life. And I have seen a lot of frogs.
Today I learned that frogs can shape-shift into slugs.
Froggy sees the cat loaf and will raise you a UFO. Or an egg sunny side up, haven't decided.
