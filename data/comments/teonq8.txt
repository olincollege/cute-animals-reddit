and I didn’t know that little deer make such a funny cartoon sound
Lol I love that the fawn gets quieter when he starts speaking Spanish 😂
I was thinking "there's no way that deer speaks Spanish", and realized I'm an idiot.
aww.. Where's the mother deer?
I love how when he gets no proper answer in English he tries asking in Spanish - just in case.
Spanish transcription \[English translation\]  
Human: ¿Dónde está mamá? \[Where’s mom?\]  
¿Dónde? \[Where?\]  
Deer: sad meep  
Human (softly): ¿Dónde? \[Where?\]  
Deer: sad, ever quieter meep  
Human:                                         ¿Dónde tú mamá? \[Where’s your mommy?\]  
	(questioning/doubtfully): ¿No tengas? \[You don’t have one?\]  
¿No tengas? \[You don’t have one?\]  
	(more sure):                        ¿No tienes?  \[You don’t have one?\]
Deer: loud meep  
Human: (speaking normally) Lo siento... pobrecito \[I’m sorry... poor thing.\]   
Deer: Acknowledging meep  
Just a general PSA: leave baby deer where you find them! The mom is probably out and about and will be back soon. Only intervene if you find a baby either a) standing next to a dead adult female deer or b) in the same spot the next day with wrinkled ears. That’s a sign of dehydration and a signal that the mom hasn’t been around to feed it.

Edit: the mistranslation of “No tienes?” - my apologies and thanks to everyone who helped me out!
I really felt it when they said "meep"
What a cutie 😊
Meep!
No habla espanol
When I was a kid we once had a baby deer get stuckin our back fence. The sounds it made were soul crushing, and the mom was scared and watching from the edge of the woods a ways away. My dad freed it, and the mom was so happy. But my golden retriever decided to check out the baby and got headbutted by mom for his trouble. Lol. Mom didn’t mind our little terrier though. She kept bringing her babies around as if showing them off for years after. It was kind of sweet, like ”look how they are doing!”
Ears are straight, the baby’s great. 
Ears are curled, they’re alone in the world. 

Only intervene if they are found with curled ears.
Definition of 'awww' right there!
TIL they make the cutest sounds.
>No tengas?

I like how even the deer got a bit confused with his conjugation.
Oh my fucking god. This is literally one of the cutest things I've seen in forever. Holy fucking cute balls.
Like that the guy is translating to spanish hoping the deer would get what he is trying to say ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
let me boop that thing please
I love how the little one is trying to communicate with pure intentions
Donde esta biblioteca?
I like when he switched to spanish like the deer would understand him better.
If you ever see a fawn like this hidden in some brush leave it be.  The mom left it there to go do mom deer business, she will be back for it.
omg. I rarely turn the sound on but so glad I did for this one.

But I've learned the first rule of baby deer is watch out for mommy deer coming back. They "park" the babies to do things and come back. Meep.
Oh deer
Aww 😍
I like how he switched languages, like, oh you don’t speak English? I’ll try asking in Spanish! Maybe the baby speaks Spanish! Where’s your mommy, baby?
PSA here, if you ever happen to see a baby deer alone, do not take it away, it's mom did not abandon it. Female deer often leave their fawns in hidden places like tall grass or thickets to keep them safe from predators while they go graze.
The mom is near by within sight. Don’t touch it. They bring their offspring to a place where it can hide easily and wait until night to go back for them. It’s harder for the mom to hide because their much larger, so she finds a different spot near by and watch’s her young from a distance
People, if you ever should come across a fawn or any animal baby don't get involved. I know it's heartbreaking, but the mother does know where it is.

Even if it doesn't, let nature take it's course.

If you ABSOLUTELY care, then keep a far distance and check in the morning. Sometimes it can do more harm then good.

The type of animal may involve different circumstances. Things like taking baby rabbits to the local animal hospital....you don't want to know what they really end up doing to them.

Again, I know it's heartbreaking...been there. Not all of these situations end happy.

Nature can be brutal.

Just like human nature.
If you see a "lost fawn" leave it alone, his mother left it there FOR A REASON
I’m getting some serious Bambi vibes
Meanwhile,

Mom:

![gif](giphy|A03pTCglKdaRG)
My day would now revolve around worry that the deer would not find its mother and die. I would then forever be stuck in thoughts about that poor deer and wonder if it survived if i didn't see the reunion.

Seen too many little baby animals left to the elements and not make it unfortunately, some instantly come to mind.
Very sweet
I like how he switched to Spanish when he quickly realized the deer does not speak English.
[0:07] 

Human: Donde? 

Fawn: \* stares with sad eyes *

[0:11]

Fawn: Dejected meep and looks away ...

[0:13]

Human: Donde?

[0:14]

Fawn: Even quieter and dejected meep.

------------

Disney could not have made this more dramatic, lmao.
Aw, pobreseto. Haha
Guy just shared real life **Bambi** and folks are critiquing his Spanish! SMH! 

They had such a cute conversation!
Mama Leaves baby in safe place to go find food, sometimes she can’t come back for many reasons. Give baby fortified milk, until she returns or baby grows up enough to feed itself.
That's a cool dog, never seen one like that before
the sad meeps

![gif](giphy|BEob5qwFkSJ7G)
He doesn’t know ..
Clearly a Spanish speaker
Did he just make sure the baby deer didn't speak Spanish?
Thanks duolingo and Laura Pausini! I understood all of it!
Donde esta la biblioteca
Aww i want it 🤗
Spanish deer?

Edit: deer do not speak Spanish.
Reminds me of Pokemon.. damn cute
Duuuude, I do the same thing with animals. I guess I always use Spanish with people close to me, so I slip into it when I want to speak gently to my dogs or my friends' pets.
But where is the mom? 😰
Ok but did the baby find her mama? I need to know!!
Mama probably just "parked" the little one there while she went to look for food. Chances are she'll be back later.
Fawns are adorable. I hope mom is okay and has returned
Sad! Everybody’s on here talking about how the guy is speaking Spanish but all I wanna know is did they ever find mama?
English wasn't working so he switched it up 🥺💜😂 I love that, I do that with my pets sometimes lol
Oh man I just want to hold that little baby!!
Had a similar experience once. You could tell he knew to stay where his mom told him too. I got pretty close, just trying to make sure he was ok. One of the worst smells ever.
Oi it's only fucking Bambi look!!! so cute!
Hope the little fawn made it back home safely, precious little thing
If you find a baby deer, *always leave it alone* unless it's injured or sick (laying on its side with its legs out). The mom stays away most of the time so it doesn't lure predators.
I found a baby deer once in the corner of my apartment complex when I was in college. At the time, I didn't know that the mother will often leave them in a specific spot while they look for food. Dumb me went to save it...it followed me around for so long. I tried to find any semblance of any other deer. I found one on the other side of our fence and didn't leave till the little one got out. Is it weird that I still feel like an asshole?

Regardless, whenever I see a baby deer in a public area my heart breaks tremendously...
I always revert to Spanish when talking to animals, doesn’t matter where in the world I am, it just feels wrong not too
bless this man n.n
Me: Aww man why was he talking in Spanish. No wonder the deer didn’t understand. 

Also me: wait a minute …
“Oh deers don’t understand English? Let me try Spanish”
I love how it stopped when he starts talking spanish lol
If that's a baby, don't touch it. The mother likly left it there to keep it safe from predators. They often do that when they have to leave to find food or something.
Love how Bamby here only “answers” the last question after OP get his grammar right! 😅
Feel bad for the fawn but I couldn't help giggle at the "where ya mom at" lol
Looks like pokekon go just got real!
That so cute
I love how he switches from English to Spanish as if that was the communication issue.
sweet baby.. 💘🦌
**PSA - LEAVE FAWNS ALONE IF YOU FIND THEM "ABANDONED."**

Because it's NOT abandoned. Momma deer is off foraging for food and has stashed the fawn in a safe spot while she does. Take your pic and quietly fuck off. She will return.

Thanks to North Woods Law I know that mama’s leave their babies to go look for food and to just leave the baby alone. Check back in a couple hours to make sure she came back for them.
Mama will be back, they always leave the young once alone.
bambi
i love this video
So that what animals hear cos when he switched I didn’t understand a single fucking thing
That is one of the cutest MEEPS I've ever heard!
Edward
Probably out looking for a nice shrubbery.
❤️
Aww.
so precious
cameraman: where’s your mama?

deer: …iuuno
Dude switches to Spanish so the deer will understand him
Awwe! I would have to physically restrain myself from feeding all my fruits and veg to that baby.   


"Leave it alone, MissKillian!!! Her mother will be back, just leave it alone!"
I have a minnow that is bilingual. Spanish was his first language. Clever lil fella.
Does he change to Spanish expecting the deer to understand?
"Dondé está mama?"


#**"BEEP"**
I just wanna hug that thing
The deer was like Que?
That man’s voice made me feel so safe and warm.
"Where's your mom at?"

Deer: ...

¿Donde esta tu mama?

Deer: aight, so basically...
Meep Meep
The dejected “meep” 🥺
The deer probably didn't understand him because he was ending the sentence with a preposition! Come on we all know dear are very intelligent!
Shit, deer don't speak English, lemme try Spanish instead.
Meep!
But did he find his mama? 🥺
With no regret I would lay down my life for that precious baby meep.
By far the cutest thing I have seen in a long time.
My heart just freaking melted
Wow who knew the toontown deer noise was actually accurate haha
I need to watch this all day .. how sweet
That 5th meep fucked my whole day up
every time it meeped my heart fluttered. 🥺 what’s cutie pie.
Where was it's mommy ...sooo cuteeere
My cat was Very concerned about the baby deer noises.
Poor little fawn
weh!
"Hey, where your mom at? Where yo... ¿Donde esta mama? (Where is mom?). ¿Donde? (Where?) ¿Donde? (Where?) ¿Donde tu mama? (Where is your mom?) ¿No tengas? ¿No tengas? ¿No tienes? (You don't have one?) Lo siento, pobrecito. (I'm sorry, poor thing.)
Mama ain't going to come near while you are standing there.
"Where's your mom?"

"Idunno..."
I just can't...I am stop so cute lost words can't speak too precious. 🥰💕
Wow, that fawn is adorable.
I dont remember this on my old 'see n say'. Vital information lacking in our childhood educational toys. It can tell me a bunny says BOING but wont make room for a deer to say meep?
My heart is melting! This is so cute!
That's stupid. Everyone knows that deer don't speak spanish.
My Duolingo lessons finally paid off.
I’m Fawning over this
I have never heard a deer cry before, thanks for that..
I think this super funny when English didn't  work. So let us use a different language. Mommy this didn't  work let us try different versions of Mother? I think he may have pulled out his phone and tried a few others. This is what I do. I  worked in retail with lost kids. Try English then Spanish, French,Russian, Mandarin.....by that time the Mother had shown up.
r/savevideobot
Omggggggg I am dying this is so cute, my heart, when he says where your mama and it get quieter 😭😭😭
Meep!
The dude is like "Oh this deer doesn't speak English"
I had a baby deer walk in front of my car late one summer night. Instead of running right across the street it sort of walked around my car and right past my open drivers window. I couldn’t believe that the thing sounded like it was meowing at me. I’m not sure what I expected it to sound like but it wasn’t that.
meepy boi
My heart🥺
Hello fine little sir, may Inask you where is your mother?

MEEP
u/tvalverde
Speaks english
MEEP
Speaks Spanish
meep
I'll be annoyingly sensible here. Mother deer often leave their young alone in a safe place so they can go and forage. If you find a young deer alone, 90% of the time it's fine and just waiting for mum to come vack. So just leave it alone.
TOO CUTE TOO TOO TOO CUTE OH MY GOD
meeps slightly louder
Staaahp! The squeakiness! I can't take it. This is the cutest ever.
Doesn’t anyone care what happened to that poor Fawn?
it's not nice to ask bambi where is his mom
This is the cutest animal sound I've ever heard....
I love it
Pretty sure I could hear mom in the woods. Might've been the initial sound I was hearing and why I was confused as to where the sound was coming from
The deer speaks Spanish
DONDEEE
Love how he switched to Spanish 😂
Did he say "pobrecito?"
But did the baby deer ever find its mother?
I’m just gonna pretend that the end of this video was that ultra cute little buddy ran off with his mom and siblings.
These new Duolingo stories are great.
I’ve been watching this for half an hour now.
Lol aaaww so cute
No English? 
Maybe Spanish?
A Bambi joke, in Spanish. Well played.
Thought the little guy knew Spanish for a second, but just meep.
Oh my gosh, it's the most popular post on r/aww and it's only existed for 13 hours!!! :O
The cuteness overload...I love the fact that he asked him in English and than again in Spanish and the fawn was like, "oh!" And got a little quiet...baby animals will be the ☠️ of me.
Is there anyway I can get credited for this video?
I love how Reddit just parrots the same comment over and over and over and over and over and over but with slightly different wording like they’re gonna get in trouble for plagiarizing. 

DoNt ToUcH tHe DeEr tHe MoM WiLl Be bAck
Awe sweetheart where's your momma
The sad little "Meehhh" after he asks "where is your mom?"

😭😭😭
Meep 🥺🥺
What does the fawn says? „Meep”
wake up babe new munyanyo just dropped
My man had a whole conversation with the deer
Donda esta la biblioteca.
I love how the camera guy just switched to spanish, like a deer would understand that
Oh my deer…- mi corazón
At the meep city
😭
i’d die for that lil guy
Such a cute noise.
Hope he found his mamma ❤❤❤
Oh! My heart goes out to this precious little one! I hope they found their mama.
¿No tengas?
My son is Spanish speaking so I'm used to trying to talk to him in Spanish so it was instinctual.
The last meep was so cute but so sad😢
r/nosabokid
¿Dónde?
very nice small deer
omg cute ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
How are you not over that wall and hugging that deer?!
Hey hooman his understand what you are asking him.
Meow
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|kissing_heart)
Good kitty
Lol why is he assuming that the baby deer speaks Spanish?
Mmmmm, dinner
If it's making noise like that it's probably hungry and mom isn't coming back :(
It would be great if everyone saying awww to this would feel the same about the 80 billion animals we're needlessly killing every year.
Poor baby :(
Free deer bro!

Feed it and let it run round for a few years and then one day Bam!  Enought Jerky for everyone
Shame people look at this and see good hunting. Humans are a violent race. Not the ideal choice to be stewards of this world.
If you find one of these, don't touch them, their mother will reject them due to your smell.

Touch it and it's dead. That video was frightening to me.
Awww my heart! Poor little baby got lost. I hope they were able to find the mother. That or get it the care it needed. 💜
i came here to lift my spirits not annihilate them so bad they become demons
Aww, Bambi is looking soo sad. I want to hug him
I love that he switches to spanish to speak with animals.
Did you find its mama?
Hahahaha what she is saying this cute
😍
Always a brick wall and some kind of deer or bear.
Sounds like he forgot how to speak Spanish. Cute vid
I have never heard a deer before. How adorable!
This is so cute and also sad but I can’t stop watching
Oh it’s bambi. Anybody give him the news?
I hope the mom found the baby.

Also I love how polite this man was.
It's like a Lil squeaky toy
That baby deer is not worried, because he knows that perfectly adequate chest high wall will protect it.
Baby deer has a lot to say. Lol
Damn. The new Doctor Dolittle film looks great!
adorable unexpected guest
Donde
"Guey!  Guey!"
why do they sound like minecraft animals lololol
That's not the noise I was expecting. Thinking about it, I had no idea what noise deer made. I have to imagine I should have thought they did something for communication.
Meep
Did they find the mom?
Fricken cute
Her mama is probably around somewhere, waiting for Mr. Human to leave!!!
That sound!
wonder why he thinks the deer is latino
I'm dying everytime i hear that "mmmeeeeeee"
Damn Bambi
Lo sinento :(
MEH!
Cute
chupapi munyayo
It's like that Phineas and ferb episode.
Where your mom at? 

*meep!*

*speaks spanish*

“Aight so…”
Poor little guy!
I love that he just had a whole conversation with lil deer.
🥺🥺🥺those sounds after he starts speaking Spanish…my heart💖
“Maybe if I meow like a cat, he’ll leave” 

Mau
Lovely video
Meep
Looks like venison is back on the menu boys
The cuteness!
🥺
Awww that is so sweet. I hope Mom was nearby.
I can’t tell you guys how much I love this video
Omg!!!!! Cuteness overload!!!! I want to hug her so bad!!!
That is so adorable but also sad. I hope the baby found it’s mom or vice Versa.
Poor baby lost it's momma. 😢
I found a baby deer in the middle of the road. Got off my motorcycle and walked up. Petted it and got it to go into the woods so it didn't get hit by a car.
My heart just melted
He sounds like a learning Spanish tape
Poor baby!
He was great in Phineas and Ferb
Button nose
she don't speack spanish or english , try some french or german…
who else was waiting for a boop?  >\_<
Deer make noise?!?!?
These situations are so hard because I’m afraid of putting my scent on them or something but then again they really could be orphaned. For any animal.
awwwwww poor baby :(
Dog
“Where yo mom at boy?” “Where yo mom at?”
#so where's mommy? Now i wanna know
Did he found his mother?
Somebody needs to hit momma dear up on her pager and tell her where her baby is, or I’m not gonna sleep.
Deer moms will leave their fawns in the place they think is the safest before leaving to go find food.

So if there's a fawn by itself in your garden, it's because the fawn's mom thinks your garden can be trusted with her child's life.
awe.. bambi lost her momma.
Whoa, I like this dude’s voice!
This has been an appropriate use of meeps
So cute lol
u/indirbeni
Did it swallow the fairy of Link from the Orcarina of Time?
Any follow-up?
awww,who sooo cute:3
Oh deer
Omg I didn’t know deer made sounds. The poor thing. El pobrecito 😭😭😭
Pobresito.
Kitty here. How do I keep my hooman away from videos like this. They overloaded on cuteness again and I am tired of rebooting them.
😭😭😭
Oh no I’ll be your mama little one!
¿Dónde esta tu mamá?  ^(meeh)
xxx
Awwwwww 💔❤️
That little wet nose![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Yee
Cute!

Did the little faun ever find it’s mom?
My heart goes out to the little thing, the quieter bleat was so endearing. But I’m also hungry.
😶😶
'Lo siento pobrecito' oh my heart!
This is me at my house upstate NY. Everytime I went to start the chainsaw I heard this strange noise. Couldn't tell if it was a bird or what. Finally I found the doe. I was also mad stoned and unsure if I should take it back home with me to the city or not
Lol @ no tengas?... A "no Sabo" kid finds a deer...
I'm a puertorrican fully bilingual in Spanish and English and that's a Mexican Spanish accent.
Donda esta biblioteca?
Can someone who speaks Spanish tell me why he uses both “tengas” and “tienes”? Why would he use subjunctive first then switch?
The third meep is kinda sad
Donde esta la biblioteca
Such a sweet baby deer.  My heart!  ♥️♥️♥️  I hope mom is close by.
What a cutie ^.^
I hope he feed him
I hope he got that little buddy a carrot or some lettuce to snack on while it waited for its mom to come pick it up.
«Guess ill die»
Hey reddit, donde es tu mama? 😏
Those eyes...that wet nose...the quiet eeps. You freakin' cute thing, you!
Huh..so that's what they sound like
*eyes begin to water thinking about my boy Bambi* he was a real one.
Deer can sense preternaturally calm peeps
They are so sweet to the baby!
poor thing is lost and confused. I hope they got the baby reunited with their family.
I love that as humans we so easily relate to the emotions of animals and we "interpret" their "story" of sounds. We understand one another much better than we think.
I want to pet it!!!!! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Omg so pretty
*must not take it home*
meep
No tengas
I want an update 😭
They are very lovely animal. Once I visited a zoo. It was staring right at the camera for almost 2 minutes. I ultimately got bored so i put down the camera and the he just left
“No tenga mama?”

That made me sad… he said, “you don’t have a mom?”
Lo siento pobresito :'(  T-T
Deer intentionally drop off their babies in neighborhoods since they have learned predators like Coyotes avoid human contact and we have no interest in eating their baby.
Sweetest sound in the world. I love how he’s like Where’s your mama? What a Papi
Oh my goodness what a sweet baby!! I hope it found Mama!
6 years of Spanish, barely passed any of the classes, but I could understand this guy so I learned something I guess, which is nice.
Okay so I was about to go on YouTube to find this, but then ADHD happened and I started looking at Reddit, thanks universe.
I dunno, I dunno!
that little baby meep really got me after he asked Where is Mama
Cute and hope it finds it’s mum
MEEP!!!
Cute lil Bambi...meep!
Don't touch it or pick it up
“Maybe it speaks Spanish…?”
Careful. Whether or not you see her, mom is close.
Mom is very close by. Baby was left hidden so mama could feed herself. But what a cute little meet and squeak.
IT NEEDS HUGS!!! (I mean don’t, it’s a wild animal, but like maybe just a little hug)
ᵐᵉᵉᵖ
Its a Pokemon called Meep!
Phineas and ferb refrence ?
Wow
Fawn was like: “No hablas español”
LOL
Aww cant find mama poor thing
ah yes my highschool spanish knowledge is coming back to me
I'm fawning over this fawn
u/esti-dragut
Little one be saying "Biiii" as if Bambi was a Pokemon
Awww, he’s adorable. Does he need help?  Maybe mama is gone.
r/microbork
Cuteness overload!!!!!
😭 what a sweet baby
Those little meeps in the middle are so heartbreaking! I hope the mom came back okay.
¿Donde esta tu mama? Mehhhhh
Meanwhile the scene from Bambi where he’s looking for his deceased mother is playing out for the poor baby deer.
I was expecting a muppet. Beaker to be exact.
Ai que lindo!
You ain’t shit asking Bambi where his mom is 😒
[Saluda a tu madre de mi parte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjpUfdjYR6s)
I can’t take this
I love how he switches from English to Spanish. It's like he thought the baby deer spoke Spanish. Meep.
Cute! Must be at least a few weeks old because it doesn't have its womb fangs anymore.
lo siento, pobrecito 😢
Thumper goes thump. Bambi goes MEEP!
Sounds like Japanese voiced Tony Tony Chopper
adorable >< !
Chung fgft hgyuj kii ?
Cute
Mama left baby somewhere safe and went to find food. She’ll be back.
“Lo siento, pobrecito” HAHAHA that was so funny for some reason
Let me try Spanish, he'll maybe understand me now.
  
Who watched the cartoon deer Bambi?
Feel like this is just taunting a lost child...
😍😍😍
Can anyone explain how a mother deer communicates "wait here while I forage" to a baby? Does she just dip when they aren't looking?
Best video I saw to today
Adorable
Deer was saying “no tengas”, what is that?
Omg my heart can't handle the cuteness! How it's little nose boops up when it meeps! ❤️

And the tiny soft 'meh' it did just 😭😭😭❤️

10/10 for cuteness and the n'awwww factor.
One of the cutest clips I've seen❤️
Meep = no se
Not a sound I would expect coming from a fawn
Well that was sad lol. The guys like “do you not have a mom? I’m sorry”
So what happened??? Did it ever find mama?????
Please keep her 😭😭
Ayo he be understanding spanish
Awww Man why r they so cute. They actually communicate properly. My heart is molten
Dude learn Spanish.
My man asking Bambi where his mom at 💀
❤️🥰❤️
imagine if it said in a deep voice "behind you"
"oh you don't have a mum, i'm sorry", anyways, WHO GOT THE BEER (just making a joke here, i'm sure he helped him)
I legit didn't even know deer could make sounds with their face before this video
She sounds like Uni the unicorn from the old Dungeons and Dragons cartoon.
BAMBIIIII 🥺
I would've said "What's up Bambi, did your mother return from her visit to Stan Lee?"
Sounds like Navi.
I thought you was talking about Meep from Phineas and Ferb
No sabo kid
So every species kids sound funny
So cute![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|snoo)
Pero, si encontró a mamá? I got to know!
Bro it sounds like when you click on Freddy's nose in the poster
What a cute little baby! I can’t get enough of the ‘meeps’ ❤️
Holy shit he's too cute
"Have you seen my mommy? My name is Bamby
next time I see a wild animal or a human being who’s way too drunk at the party this is what I’m gonna tell it “donde ta tu mamá? No tengas? Lo siento”
Dodne, are you from Sacramento
Real life bambi 🥺
the meeps were all on par
Very cute but keep your distance cuz ticks.
Why on earth is everyone in here saying “meep”??

It’s clearly saying “waahwh”.
So cute
Leave that baby alone 🤣
"Where's your mama? You don't know? I'm sorry, poor boy" uhhhh I think lol
At least now I know that Duolingo is working on me.
Oooooh, so sweet! 💕
O be still my heart. Sweet baby. I would've had to stake out the area to make sure the Mama came back.
I need to know.. did it find its mama??
Omg that is so cute 😻😻😻
🤩🤩
Pues, ayudale!
Oh, my heart ❤️ That baby was just talking back- too cute!

Povresito

Deer's are known to abandon it's fawn in the midst of danger to save itself. Hate to say but it's facts.

Sadly, deer do this all the time. Leave their young around for hours a day.
