Pam: "They are the same picture."
The low budget remake
I did find watching those moves that Toothless was very feline like in mannerisms, so this is probably pretty accurate.

I doubt the bottom set are toothless though.
Uhm, it’s just two photos of Toothless and his lady love?
r/airplaneears
Bottom picture is seconds before cat slaps and running everywhere like idiots
🎶 Ebony and ivory, LIVING IN PERFECT HARMONY 🎶
This is a lot closer than you might think. [The animators actually modelled some of the dragons movements on cats.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/7yfwsn/the_toothless_animation_for_this_scene_in_how_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
♡´･ᴗ･`♡
Love this!
Same energy
Didn't they base Toothless' behavior after a cat?
We both know these cats  snorted skooma and scratched the shit out of each other moments after the foto ...
i hope they are named after them
AWwwwww
have they seen the movie, maybe they took some inspiration and now plan to fly off like dragons
This is amazing!!!
I see no difference

Can someone tell me what order to watch how to train your dragon stuff? Idk who thought it was cool to stop numbering things, I’ve looked up a timeline 5 times and never get a solid answer.
I watched the entire how to train your dragon series on acid, every film is so good, but this one in the pic had the most beautiful psychedelic scene I’ve ever seen I rewatched it like five times. This one: https://youtu.be/-AZg55qXj7U
The yin yang of cats!
this warmed my heart 😊
Same energy
I'd imagine that's not an accident - that when the animators choreographed that scene, they were working in large part from how animals - and likely specifically cats - really move and interact.
My black kitty will smell something and she crinkles her nose and goes a little cross eyed and it reminds me so much of toothless.
Their children are so ugly.
So adorable thanks for sharing so close❤️😊
Seems like there is some noise behind the white cat
No that’s accurate
Good
I see no difference
Artemis and Luna!!
this is something that i will cherish for the rest of my life :)
Try to spot a difference, I dare you.





P.S: You can’t, there is none.
Toothless reminds me of Gore Magala from Monster Hunter
Nice!
"Netflix adaptation"
Nice, I like.
lol
Adorable
**Close enough >**

>**In love with love.**
Aww
Haha, awesome.
So cuuute. The best movie
❤
Absolute perfection.
I know the both in the lower picture, but I don't know the movie.... In the top picture : just 2 cats fronting each other 🤷🏻‍♂️
Having the ears folded back like that generally indicates the cat is upset/afraid, so I don't think the cat on the right is at all happy with the situation. Otherwise neat pic.
This is what a live action version would look like 😉
I ACTUALLY LOVE THIS!😍😍😍😍
Did you know that cats, er I mean dragons, with white coloring and blue eyes are most often deaf due to mutations related to melanin and cartilage? /s
Long Cat and Basement Cat together at last... D'awwwwww
The made for tv version really had to cut the budget
This is one of the best pics I saw here
Yes
Corporate wants you to find the diference between these pictures.
It’s amazing
Here kitty kitty!
Before and after
aww
Isn’t toothless partially based on a cat?
Nice
Perfect
True love ❤️
Who said cartoons aren't real?
awwww
Someone please photoshop in Mike Tyson from the pigeons meme saying “now kith”
The difference is I'm far less disappointed in the bottom one than I am at the top one.
That’s not toothless but tacgnol
Is that Toothful I see there in the bottom picture?!
I thought these were my cats at first
I love this. Super cute!!!
Sniff sniff of trust.
Inside you there are two cats:
🥰
Woww haha
So cute
Mini-panther and a cloud!
I see no difference
Ddaawwwwwww
Lol love it 😍💚💙💗❤️💋
There’s no difference.
This settles the age-long argument about dragons and cats being the same.
That is actually really sweet (:
Nice. I'd put up a pic of my cat Toothless, but no one wants to see that
Yeji
Awww
love it!
Difference of 4K
Why have they put the same picture twice
I spent the entire series fangirling about how adorable and cat-like toothless was! My husband, rolling his eyes,, was like, "I know, he's just a big black kitty, he's adorable, yeah, yeah." 😆
Those are my friends
Life imitates art
Nice that they didn't fight.
why do these cats look like my dad’s cats 🗿
Too funny!!!!
Pure and prrecious
Sign these two for the live action version
so cuutee
I love it <3
This photo brings me much joy
Unus

That is creepy 😅
"Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony...."
✊🏿

Ebony and Ivory... live together in perfect harmony.
How boring. Just two times the exact same picture...
Kiss..
Omg awww
exactly it looks like pokemon cartoon
Same energy.
Awn ❤️
The cats look like they're about to have a standoff.
same energy
Better, even
Uncanny! Great Pic! x
r/catsnamedtoothless
My neighbor worked on these movies (animator) and said they had cats come in to study them - so seems accurate! Haha
When was there a white one? Was there a third movie I missed?
