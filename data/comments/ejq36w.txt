The most adorable dog ever!


EDIT: I really do like cows and I find it hysterical people are referencing Jason from The Good Place becuase my name is actually Jason.
*M√∂nch*
You're going to need a big car seat for that guy!
Ha. I fostered an orphan calf and I wonder sometimes if she will grow into her teeth

NORMAN
Norman?  Hellooooo?
If that was my cow, I'd name him Norman!
That cutie has really pretty eyes.



A little hairy for my taste, though.
My name is cow  
And wen it's day  
Wen all the cloud  
haf gone away  
I ride in truck  
We zoom and race  
Then wen we stop  
I monch the face

Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about.

Cowgirl, y‚Äôall!

Is that a Zebu?
awww
Grass doggo
Moo!
I was sure that was a deer, but comments say it's a cow.

What's with the dog-like tail? Cows tails are not like that.
This is some high level cute as shit!
CalfChinChomps is a thing 

I like this thing
Man, my calf just tries to swallow my arm whole.

Good doggie make tail waggle
Confirmed
Y'all wish you were that girl. I wish I was the cow, gotdayumn!
What‚Äôs wrong with your cat?
OMG this is the cutest! And you look like a human version of a cute doe!!!
I‚Äôd wanna eat too
I also have a fetish of biting a girl right next to her chin. Looks like this is my spiritual animal
I don't blame him...
So do I.
Every woman is hot
You're cute
#haha
Carhart work apparel is great
I'd like to munch too!
Nice woman
I think finding a girl looking so pretty dressed in Carhartt being surrounded by baby cows is my new life goal
Now that is affection! What a Q T
When will animals stop driving heavily polluting cars so damaging to the environment and eating us in that abomiable zoocene human genocide ? So revolting !
In Soviet Russia, cow eats you!
Theory confirmed. Owning a Carhart beanie is a prerequisite for getting monched on by little cows.
The front looked like a deer and the back looked like a dog and apparently it‚Äôs a  **baby cow**
Cronch cronch cronch
[removed]
So sweet!! What are you going to do with him? Sincerely asking.
"If a cow ever got the chance he'd eat you and everyone you care about."
"Gonna eat me hooman? Not if I eat you first!"
It doesn't hurt?
Baby moo! ‚ù§üíõüíöüíôüíúüíôüíöüíõ‚ù§
Now who's the hamberder?

And then she got mad cow disease.
I really like this picture
Thus begins the Were-cow‚Äôs reign of terror.
[Simpsons did it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKTPCOOyiZk)
I love him or her!!!!!
Monch....Can you blame him?
‚ÄúIs you food?‚Äù
Your chin looks like a cow udder, apparently.
Why do you have a cow in your car?
My cat when food bowl is empty and it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe time.‚Äù 

Accept it‚Äôs not anything like that but just my cat sitting there and staring into the deepest recesses of my soul.
Someone give this lady and her hooman a gold
I want a cow but where the fuck would I keep it once it got bigger than a dog
Yer gonna turn into a werecow next full Moooooo-n
That‚Äôs why you keep the windows up...
NORMAN!!!!
Is that a baby person
‚ÄúHow does it feel now that the tables are turned ah HA‚Äù
- smol cow
He probably likes the salt that we have from sweating.
forest puppy
Your expression is priceless!
That's a weird looking dog
I love this pic so much. I house sat for a friend who had a calf (among other farm animals) 17 years ago. That week contains so many of my favorite memories from my early adulthood. The calf accompanied me as I fed the chickens, goats, fawns, cats, and dogs every morning and evening round. We were buddies...though her red hair would cover my work clothes by the time I was done. After the first day, I never wore something I planned to stay in.
I‚Äôm wearing that same hat.
That is cute as hell, what is that critter, a deer dog?
Does he have a tail?
It's Norman!
What kind of dog is this
The tables have finally turned.
Anyone know who makes that jacket?
That's a funny looking dog.
Nice jacket
To all the people asking what animal this is, this is what we in the ATLA universe call an elephant moose goat.
*Moonch
Is that a donkey?
No, that's a baby crocodile eating a lady chin..
Good thing that beanie is flame retardant!
I'm consistently blown away by how many people have house calves these days. They're the new puppies of reddit

I have the same hat
A forest dog
*Mlomp*
Can those things be potty trained or do they pretty much just let it fly whenever?
So jealous of u
Can anybody tell me what the fuck this is I need to buy one like yesterday.
Why did I think this was a deer at first?
Cows are just big dogs
Clearly, it's a platypus.
Monch back
We have the same beanie! Im wearing mine now too.
That‚Äôs a weird looking dog
Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance he'd eat you and everyone you care about.
So get Allstate, and protect yourself from mayhem, like monch.
Aww so cute
Baby looks hungry. But what happened to its mom? Or maybe it's just on the way back from bath and checkup.
Holy cow!

Hey humans taste much better than grass
I love that they have rectangular pupils, it's so neat

I initially read this as 'he likes me too much'. I still believe that's true and is expressed in a much more direct way.
I love him. His name will be chompy. The lovely chompy, chomping.
Oh deer!
The cow is super adorable, obviously, but also I really like your jacket. Brand?
It seems he's developed a taste for flesh.

Former cow mom here. I can't help but notice all the people in the comments wishing they had one and I wonder if y'all would feel the same way if you knew you'd prolly have to deal with scours at some point ... lol. They're cute until yellow diarrhea starts squirting outta their booties!
Nice cat

I feel like that cow has a nice liver, perhaps with some fava beans and a nice patte
Adorable!
Nice dog
So much monch
How dairy.
I seen his father at McDonalds in my big mac
Please consider going vegan for baby calves like him. 

If he was born in the dairy industry, he'd be considered useless and killed.
Oh yeah, the famous cat-tail mini cow
Wow look at that cat
Wow he was born a a weird time of year! Glad hes doing well!
who wont like to monch monch on you !!!
Very cute. Nice carthartt beanie too.

Oh my gosh! What an adorable calf! It's adorable curly tail makes my heart sing.
He's gotten his first taste of human flesh, you're doomed now. You can see it in his eyes.
She dead. I can‚Äôt tell if her shoe is missing though so not sure...
Is this deer, cow or dog? Dog because of tail?
So do I...so do iüòà

What type of dog is that!? /s
What's a calf doing in a car though? Going to the vet?
Does it have a cat‚Äôs tail?
I'm calling the police right now.
Sure when the baby cow does it it‚Äôs cute but when I do it I have to go to ‚Äúsexual harassment training‚Äù...
Why the fuck isn't anyone questioning the tail
Is that a calf? Very nice pet to have, i grows so big, u have to build a house for it later üòÉ

Nice cow could use some buns around it though
Fact that we worship these little cuties,makes them even more adorable :)
Odd that it's mostly attractive young women in these selfies. Funny how that works out.
