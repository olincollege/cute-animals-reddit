I think that's the cutest rat I've ever seen
I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of rats or mice but this little man looks very polite
I had a pet rat in college. Her name was Solitaire. I used to stretch my legs out under the blanket, put her on top in the middle, and then when I pulled the blanket on each side, she would fly straight up in the air, and then land softly back on the blanket. She loved it! She would actually walk over and wait for me to do it. I called it the "Ratapult".
Gizmo made me smile ‚ò∫Ô∏è
r/lilgrabbies
Is that Prisoner of Azkaban?
Is that‚Ä¶ Peter Pettigrew?
Do they actually like cheese?
I'm not too fond of rats, but Gizmo is a cutey. That face is adorable.
Now my interest is piqued. So, you let Gizmo stroll around the house? Do your rats wander out and come back in themselves? How are rats as pets? Docile? Clean? High maintenance? Sorry for too many questions
We need a picture of you reading the Rats of NIMH with him.
"Whatchaaa reading??" - Gizmo
He looks like a very polite salesman. I will certainly buy his wares
WUUUURMMMSCHWAAANZZZ
Aber in cute
I see gizmo is a bookrat.
Oh goodness. They are adorable! Please tell them I think they are the cutest little rat there is. Bonus if you give them a tiny kiss.
Don't feed him after midnight üòÇ
In learning german and there's nothing that warms my heart more than fully understanding random sentences, they're easy ones, but still
Precious baby <3
uhh harry potter and the rat is adorable
Lovely photo
This is ridiculously cute.
How cute..does he recognize his name when called?
Is that Prisoner of Azkaban? Or is it a later book?
If they were ever to make a live action ratatouille, this little chappy would make an excellent Remy.
Awww! Cute little buddy!

My best friend ever when I was a kid was my rat Whiskers. She would hang out on my shoulders and share my ice cream. I trained her to do jumps and she was amazing.
Thats amazing he looks so smart holding that book.
So cute! ü•∞
OK, this is too cute. Almost looks like she belongs in a story book ‚ù§
It reminded me the book Flowers for Algernon
He is adorable!!!üòçüòçüòçüòç
Hey Gizmo! üëã
D'aww...that little face!
I wanna cuddle that little critter...rats are so cute! ü•∞üêÄ
I would love to keep rats as my building doesn't allow pets but their short life spans would be too hard for me.
He‚Äôs the best page holder I‚Äôve ever seen. We love you Gizmo!
I only had the helpful award but this was helpful in making my day. I absolutely love rats. I‚Äôve only ever had one myself but it was because she was the best rat ever and I couldn‚Äôt replace her. Yours is too cute!
Can he cook?
Supers√º√ü üòç
Gizmo is one of the most wonderful little creatures I have ever laid eyes on.
![gif](giphy|PQKlfexeEpnTq)
Adorable! Is it inviting you for a dinner it just cooked?
I would be suspicious of Gizmo while reading HP3
He looks like he needs a little Tux
I love him
Okay.  Gizmo is pretty stinking cute
So darling!! I miss having rats, they make such good pets. I just wish their lifespan was longer. Give him a pat for me!
Awhh so cute!

My first pet rat was called Schurfie (the Dutch name for Scabbers) and I always wanted to name one Gizmo.
Never came to that (though I did have had 12 rats in Total over a few years) and I‚Äôm currently not owning rats. I do miss them but the many illnesses and short life span was just too much for me to handle. 

But Gizmo is super sweet ‚ù§Ô∏è
I never knew I needed a rat until now
HE LOOKS ANIMATED WTF
Look at those little hands
~~Bat!~~ Rat!
He is a Disney rat.
Und dazu Harry Potter, perfekt.
I love rats! My heart rat Oreo, was my best friend. He did everything with me! I‚Äôd walk up to his house, he would jump on my shoulder and I‚Äôd bring him to the kitchen and let him pick out his own snack from the fridge. Then he‚Äôd cuddle into my robe and munch away before falling asleep on my stomach in my robe. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Rats are cute and smart! After our dog died, I wanted to get a rat instead. My husband got so annoyed with me, he thought it was a ploy to get another dog and told me, "fine, get a dog, I don't want a rat!" That was not my original plan, but now I've got two dogs. I still want a rat someday...
Let me introduce you to my jealousy, and as an added bonus my increased want for my 2nd fav animal
Guten tag
I'm still learning German but from what I can see it looks like you're reading Harry Potter?
He looks like he‚Äôs gonna ask me if I have any games on my phone.
Keine Angst zu haben. Der kleine Ritter ist hier! (Sorry my German is super rusty, it‚Äôs been years)
I hope he isn't missing a finger
Unendlich s√º√ü ü•∫
Wasn‚Äôt he in Ratatouille? So cute ü•∞
Wie hei√üt das Buch ü§£? PS Der kleine ist wirklich s√º√ü üòä
The rat has good taste!! Harry Potter ftw!! Und deutsches Buch auch! Liebe es!!
Black, Lupin, Hermine, that must be a Harry Potter book! I'm BiLingual Mom! WooHoo!
What a precious little fella! Give him a few more cuddles please!
Oh Harry Potter!
Harry Potter, nice
Love the rat and love the choice of book
Gizmo, Hayat, Judokus! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I can see the personality from here!
Cute
So cute!
I love him
I need more pictures of this rat, and I will read him bedtime stories until I fall asleep.
I love him
Where did you get that ratatouille?
So cute! How old?
He‚Äôs very charming!
Such a sweet little face.
I didn‚Äôt ever realize that Gizmo from Darkwing Duck was a actual rat
Genuine question- How do you clean its dropping?
That guy is Disney character cute
Gizmo is so cute
Adore
Cute!
He's so cute <3 has anyone made a ratatouille joke yet? ;p
This pic made me tear up for some reason. He's super cute. Thanks for sharing!
Adorable!
He‚Äôs so cute!!!
I don‚Äôt even like rats but this guy is adorable!
He needs a children‚Äôs book written about him.
Omggg i need one
Er sieht wirklich sch√∂n aus
Hallo Gizmo!
I love Gizmo!
Friend!
Omg i just watched some girl with hairless rat on youtube and came here and you are first post showing up.
‚Äùwith his lip curled he said, I knew I smelled a rat‚Äù
What a cutie. Check out those r/lilgrabbies
Danke vielmals f√ºr Ihre s√ºsse Fotografie Ihrer Ratte! Geniessen Sie nun bitte weiter ihr Buch, Sie B√ºcherwurm
Cute
HI GIZMO!
Love for Gizmo froim the states. Those cute little grabbies :D
Oh my goodness gizmo is a little cutie pie
My wife and I got rats for our kids over the weekend. I was told no to Ratticus Finch
I wish they lived longer.....
I would so, so rat-nap your Gizmo.  More pics, please!
Hi, Giz! üòç
Er sieht sehr schoen aus!
So very cute!
I hope your TV is mounted to the wall. It looks like that TV stand is holding the world on its back...
Leseratte
He looks like a good lad
Oh my GOSH HIS LITTLE FEETSIES
Looks straight out of a pixar movie!
I don‚Äôt know him, but I love him.
We had one who looked just like that!  Her name was Puaa. She was so sweet. I miss my ratties.
Aww Harry Potter auf deutsche?
The face you make when you show a friend a new song you really like.
Why do pet rats not scurry off into the house?
What is Gizmo reading? Such a cutie
Is he going to read me a bedtime story?
Liest du Harry Potter?
Excuse me, is this a cookbook?
I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs not named Scabbers, given what you‚Äôre reading.
Is that book harry potter?
I love him
This is one of the most darling pictures I have ever seen. I wish there were a children‚Äôs book about Gizmo‚Äôs adventures
I don't think I'd be able to deal with getting attached to a rat because of how short their lifespans are
Rats make great pets. I have had dozens over the years.
Love rats to bad they only live 3-4 years, I was heart broken when mine passed
Gizmo looks cute!  Had pet rats for many years.  Super affectionate and intelligent critters.  I‚Äôve never seen rats live 4-5 years as another person posted.  Can be Smelly since they pee everywhere as they don‚Äôt have bladders.  Also prone to tumors so they often life short lives and experience seemingly painful ends.    I couldn‚Äôt take it after multiple batches of them died so quickly.
Yo wtf, i usually gag when i see rats but this might the cutest thing ive seen in a while lol
I feel some Stuart Little vibes coming from this picture 
Super cute!!
You look like a very studious young rat ‚ù§Ô∏è
I have a Gizmo too and that's about his attitude he like to read and pick out what books or games to do
I have a corgi named Gizmo ! 
I love both gizmos so much
Bonus for HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban in the photo.
I hope he has master chef degree.
How do you know his name is Gizmo and not Peter?
Harry Potter in german?
Gizmo‚Äîcacaahhh!!  Adorable!
You better read him that book.
Aww what a little cutie!
That is one of the best names ever!
Is he about to cook you dinner?

Are you holding his cookbook?
Cute.
Tell Gizmo I adore him!
Hallo Gizmo! Wie geht's?
It's nice to see a rat close up front
He looks like a German rat lol (obviously I am making the assumption by the words I saw on the book).

But in all seriousness,  I'm not fond of rats and have a preconceived notion of them being dirty.  However your lil guy is cute as a button! Super clean too!  I think it's awesome you have a pet rat...lil guy is adorable!
YES YOU MAY
So adorable!
Such a cute rat, and also a really great book!
Wurmtail‚Ä¶?
Yes you may.
how do you like Gizmo‚Äôs ratatouille?
So adorable! Ahh i just wanna pet them!
O he‚Äôs darling
Now- Rats cute and all- but what book is that?
With the book, the rat reminds me of Remy from Ratatouille movie
GIZMO CA CAAA!!!!!!üíï
In french the equivalent of ¬´¬†bookworm¬†¬ª is ¬´¬†library rat¬†¬ª. That made me smile.
I also had a rat I named Gizmo. He was completely black and I only named him Gizmo because I was playing one if the Shining Force games.
Remy? ü§®
das ist s√º√ü
Talk about Lil Grabbies ü•∫ü•∫
I never thought I'd see the words precious and rats in the same sentence, but he's absolutely adorable!!
gizmo is the best
Aww hello sweet Gizmo ü§©
Gahhh, I can't wait to show my kid this picture in the morning. He's going to adore that little cutie!
He wants to open a restaurant. I guarantee it.
omg so cutee üòç
Is that Harry Potter in German?
Gizmo is adorable! Just precious!
What are the odds, the rat is helping them read Prisoner of Azkaban?
I feel like every rat should be named Rizzo, solely because he was the coolest rat outside of Splinter.

Adorable little dude, OP.
Can he cook?
Does he read aloud?
I‚Äôm in love
Ughhhhh so cute! I love rodents but they just don't live long enough for me to keep them as pets. I get WAY too attached
Hopefully he doesn‚Äôt turn into a fully grown man
Hi gizmo. Be a good rat. I hope you get a treat.
Does it know how to cook?
Is that German Harry Potter?
Can you turn to the Ratatouille recipe, please.
I had a Guinea Pig named Gizmo. And by god did it fit
I‚Äôve definitely been introduced to gizmo before
My gerbils name is gizmo!‚ù§Ô∏è
Yooo german HP Fan lets go
cheese-boi
Omfg. This has to be the absolute cutest picture I have ever seen in my life. Look at its little hands! And it‚Äôs little whiskers and nose! Aaahhh!! My heart is melting into thousands of pieces
üòç
Stewart Little?
Harry Potter in German; a fine vintage!
He can read, but can he cook?
Reading Harry Potter?
That is a sweet baby
I need more pics of Gizmo
alright, he's very cute,  the cutest rat I've ever seen- ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
His asking for a snack, so polite.
Intelligent rat
You can't fool me. That's your son after he had a run in with the grand high witch.
Too cute

Harry potter und ratten üòç
Hello
And you are German I presume
a perfect little cutie.
Good thing he has all his fingers.
awwwwwwww hi Gizmo! you sure are cute!
Awwww, so cute! I had a rat named Joe as a child. He was my best friend. I loved him so much and still miss him. I love rats, but just wish they lived longer. : (
They make such wonderful little companions <3
Are you reading behaart T√∂pfer
Too many people are sleeping on having rats as pets, and I‚Äôm saying that as a snake owner who regularly has to feed rats to my pets. Rats are incredibly intelligent, tame, friendly, and can even be trained to perform tricks. They‚Äôve even been used in psychological studies because of their remarkable ability to show empathy. The only drawback is their short lifespans; it‚Äôs why I never really kept one as a pet long-term.
Awww so cute!!!!
Saw one in person n hid in the bathroom
Gizmolino! As cute as a button
Keep him dry and don‚Äôt feed him after midnight
We have a cat named Gizmo. Let‚Äôs get together for a play date!
I love it that the little fellow is obviously a fan of German literature. Spricht dieser kleine Intellektuelle auch Deutsch?!
Such a good boy! Und Harry Potter, gute Wahl :D
give gizmo some pets for me please
\*starts nibbling\*
Such a cutie.

Also, yay me for remembering enough German to notice you're reading Harry Potter.
Gizmo is so adorable! i just watched a video about a lady adopting a hairless rat that nobody wants and it made me bawl. I want rats so bad but my family is mean about them
(Deep voice) Hello I‚Äôve come to contact you about your car‚Äôs extended warranty.
He's holding the book for you?
Is this part of a live action new Disney film??
r/foundthegerman
Just a gentle reminder not to use inhumane traps. Especially those sticky traps. Rats are cute and intelligent creatures. They don't deserve to suffer.
interesting that you're reading the part of Prisoner of Azkaban where Peter Pettigrew is revealed with your rat
I love, how the rat enjoys a bit of Harry Potter ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|stuck_out_tongue)

It is very cute!
My copy of Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere has tiny rat teeth marks from them trying to get my attention.
I love him so much it makes me hate him
I have degu(similar to a rat) called gizmo who also looks very polite
Coole Ratte!
Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Azkaban, oder?
Damn welches buch
Hello Gizmo!!! What a gentleman
he just wants to see how your day was

f i wish i had a house so i can have more pets like this lil bugger
Don't feed her after midnight. And no water!
Looks like he about to ask about my cars extended warranty
Please kiss Gizmo for me o3o
Cute rat ‚ù§ btw welches Buch liest du da? üòÑ
Gizmo is like, ‚ÄúMay I read with you?‚Äù
Ahh, is he your familiar? I see you‚Äôre reading Harry Potter.
I think you are reading harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban. If so: Good choice. If not: Which one is it?
The famous "Leseratte"
What an absolute little cutie!  I want to boop his his nose!
Do the dance Gizmo
Based on the book youre reading i thought Wormtail would have been the first choice üòç
There are so many hidden germans on reddit.
Echt s√º√üe Ratte
Rats make wonderful pets :)
Pet rats are great!  I have had several in the past.  Very friendly, clean and intelligent.
So are you reading Harry Potter in German?
I had a rat named Gizmo to! unfortunately though he passed a couple of days ago :\[
Dont let him taste the book!!!

I free roam my rats and they have chewed the spines of EVERY BOOK I OWN!!!

Love my girls though so I can't be angry.
This picture was taken before he started eating the book
Is that a Harry Potter book in Deutsch?
I suddenly want a pet rat ü•∫
This! This made my morning. Hello Gizmo. üíó
Awww so cute!
Peter Pettigrew?!
My sister has 6 (7?) ratties and they're the best little guys and gals! If I didn't have 2 cats who thought everything is a toy, I'd definitely have some rats.
Much cuter than Peter Pettigrew
I see Harry Potter. I upvote. Also cute rat.
What a clean fresh looking rat
Love this picture!
I love him. All my coins to Gizmo when I die please.
This is probably the most adorable rat I've ever seen
Guess I‚Äôm watching Ratatouille tonight then
Gizmo has a very wise little face, indeed.
Nice rat, it's totally complete your book!
Thank you for sharing Gizmo! What an adorable friend!
Why did I recognize the font of the book series despite it not being in English?
üòç
Es handelt sich wohl um eine deutsche Ratte!
Why not Remi?
not to be dramatic but I would die for Gizmo
Awww, him little face!

Edited to add: I‚Äôm probably still allergic, though. :(
Please tell this cheeseboi that I love him ‚ù§
I don‚Äôt like rats but this one is very adorable! Hi gizmo!
Awww that little fella looks so cute
Rats as pets are so under rated. Everyone seems to go for hamsters in my country and they are horrible bitey little bastards.
You're a German, Harry!
Harry Potter :D
I hold this book for you.
Love!
What language is the book in, German?
Very cute
Deutsche Harry Potter, supergeil!!
What a cutie pie! Likes like he would be a good helper with that book
Diese Kommentarsektion ist nun Eigentum der BRD
Ist das nicht Harry Potter und der Gefangen von Askaban?
Omg sooooo cute
kawaii
German version of HP #3?
What's that book and why is it german?
Oh My Goodness!!!! I just want to give him gentle snugglesü•∞ and pet him all dayüêÄ
He looks like a very intelligent rat.
Have fun reading Harry Potter!
He looks like he‚Äôs quietly interrupting your reading you give you a tidbit of information that you may find useful
Saw the movie, I heard he was a good cook üòÜ
Harry Potter in German!

Love your rat lol
I will never have a pet rat ever again... because they are the CUTEST THINGS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD and they trigger my cute aggression more than anything I've ever experienced, I can't handle it.

LOOK HOW CUTE GIZMO IS!!!!!
Adorable.
He‚Äôs frickin adorable üíû
Tremendous üòä
This is quite positively the cutest rat on the face of this earth ü§ç I love him.

Hello Precious Gizmoüôèüèªüíóü§ó
Gizmo!  Aww.  You are an 80‚Äôs baby aren‚Äôt you.
I had a ferret named Gizmo a long time ago.
AHHHHH! What a cutie patootie, oh my goodness! \~:D Thank you for sharing this awesome photo.
Now that's what we call a Leseratte ü•∞
Make sure you don't get it wet, expose it to sunlight and definitely don't feed it after midnight.  Otherwise,  cute.
Gizmo is adorable!
Me triyng to figure out what book it isüòé    I can confirm its Harry Potter
Awwwwwwwww
Ratatouille? Is that you buddy?
I love him! üòç
"yes-yes man-thing, please give pet-pets."
What a cutie!
Soooooooooooooo freaking cute üòç
German book?
Gizmo ist niedlich. 

Sag ihm viele gr√º√üe von mir ok?

We must protect Gizmo at all costs.

Those eyes
"You are never gonna guess how this shit ends!"
Ich sehe keinen fehlenden Finger also ist es nicht Wurmschwanz
This is adorable. 

The number of people who feel the need to show how clever they are for recognising incredibly well known character names in a book not printed in English is not so adorable.
Do you have a rat named Algernon?
Like hell you may!
You shouldnt have rats as pets.
hum, i smell a--- staged book.

maybe was on the shelf and thought would make for a good post?

which it certainly did indeed.
Ach un Gizmo! Wunderbar!" might be German
A rat for a pet? Yikes, what is this Harry Potter?
Gizmo aus angst
‚Äòtwas the night after xmas‚Ä¶ ( btw Gizmo is waaaaay too cute!)
...you may.
ILYSM Gizmo
rats rats were the rats
He's eating the book 'cause it's in german. Good boi Gizmo.
r a t
The cutest!
Ratatouille vibe
How cute!!! He reminds me of my baby Owen! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Those little hands!!
What a cutie pie
Reminds me of the rat in the vest in the suicide squad
I have heard they make good pets and they are pretty smart!
That‚Äôs a handsome rat
Based on the book I assume you‚Äôre reading, why is it not Peter or Scabbers??? Haha :p
Does gizmo get free run of the place?  I‚Äôm not sure how pet rats work.  He doesn‚Äôt seem to be restrained at all.
Nice, but I thought that rodents had a bit of a hunger for paper. - why is he grabbing the book?
omg he‚Äôs so cute he doesn‚Äôt even look real
Chomp
I'm in this picture and I like it.
Der ist super hubsch!
He looks very polite
Wie s√º√º√º√º√º√º√ü üôÇ
Oh hello gizmo how handsome!
Water it
Is the book Harry Potter?
Yuck, he‚Äôs trying to eat your book the dirty rat. I would donate him to a scientific research facility.
/r/lilgrabbies
He looks very polite
doch nicht aus Angst
I would /r/Ntbdbiwdfta for this rat! So cute and polite
This picture reminds of the Rats of NIMH
I would give them so many rubs.
Gizmo speaks a language I don‚Äôt know. Does he happen to speak English as well? Just want to say hi.
That is a great picture!
You mean the one in my apartment that doesn‚Äôt pay rent
OMG I love rats! So sweet and intelligent. My first job was at a pet store/dog groomer and I fell in love with the rats. Ended up being on such good terms that a mother would let me pet and handle her babies, and once they grew up I‚Äôd let them chill in my hoodie while I worked. Will never forget a customer walking in and as I greeted him a rat head popped up under my chin lmaooo his face. Ended up taking some home and their favorite place remained my hoodie. One in the pocket, one in the hood, and one exploring the inside was the norm.
I understand the Harry Potter reference but I think it needs to be said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt talk about Bruno‚Äù
omg I LOVE <3 what a sweetie
Please let Gizmo know he is a lovely little gentleman <3
Gizmo is a good book holder.
Did he win an award? He looks proud holding his employee of the month award . So cute
Lol I love it from Gremlins ?
that‚Äôs a damn fine rat!
Doch nicht aus angst indeed.

Rats are the best. One day I will have them again

Hi lil baby cutie Gizmo

Hi little fella
Ahh I see a OP is a fellow German?

I love rats so much, but they live such a short life I can‚Äôt bring myself to become attached
Awwww. 

My kitty is a Gizmo!!
Ok, he can read, but can he cook?
Ommmmmt so cuuuuute
Did you feed him after midnight?
he needs a little chef hat and a wooden spoon. üò©üíû
Rats are the best dogs
Gizmo looks so cute, just standing and staring!
Reader's Digest
Can he cook?
This is the sweetest goddamn thing I've seen maybe ever. And I don't even like rats.

Bonus points for Gizmo taking a well-timed interest in that particular book!
Hewow gizmo
Omg I So Obsessed With Gizmo I Mean Seriously I Love Him!!!  -.-
Wow!  One of my first pets was a rat named gizmo. He was our class pet and we adopted him at the end of the year.  Beautiful boy you have there.
<3
lol aweee, so cuuute!
OMG you may!! Gizmo is so very precious!!

Peanut butter

A LEGEND!!!!
Cutie
um... I zoomed in at his little paws and an actual tear came to my eye as I cooed over how cute they were. Gizmo is so adorable!
How do you keep track of them around the house?
Hat black
Is the book by Gnaw-ra Roberts ?
Gizmo looks very polite üòç
Ok that caught me way off guard.
What a great name
My cat is named Gizmo üòº
Can he cook?
Are his nails manicured
You probably shouldn‚Äôt feed him after midnight and you should consider not getting him wet‚Ä¶
I wish I could convince my other half to let me have a little buddy like Gizmo. I think this picture might help me pull that off.
That is one photogenic cutie.  You can see his little smirk.
Little chef??
Emergency food.
ratatouille in the house
Rats are such cool creatures. So smart and yet emotionally intelligent.

Nice. Now go and open a restaurant.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to reach you about your cars extended warranty‚Äù

Gizmo is your Hogwards animal!
I just adore rats
Read-a-toullie
‚ÄúWatcha doin‚Äô?‚Äù
Can you please tell Gizmo that I love him
I love Gizmo.
How did you teach him how to read? üòú

He's the cutest rattie I've ever seen ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is that Harry potter?
Handsome!
Have you ever tickled him, recorded it, and lowered the frequency? Rats giggle. We just can‚Äôt hear them. The pitch is too high.
Besides the sharp looking claws/nails, he looks super cute. He‚Äôs got a cute little face. Looks like a small little mammal but has an abundance of love
Is that POA in German? I'm jealous.
OMG HENLO GIZMO
this cutie is making reading cool again.
He is so cute! And so bad chewing on your book! LoL! I love rodents. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Why are you reading a book about how to cook rats?
What‚Äôs holding your tv up?
cuteness overload!
that face is just too adorable
I wish I could buy him a dry corn on the cob.
I didn't know a rat could be so cute üòÅ
My heart omg
Those boba eyes!
That's definitely a cartoon protagonist.
I think your rat is trying to nibble your book
And he reads German? Wow. I‚Äôve always thought rats were cute. And smart. But I didn‚Äôt know they  were THAT smart.
on this weeks episode of ratatouille
UH YOU MAY CAUSE THAT MOTHER FATHER IS ADORABLE.

Howdy Gizmo!
Sooo cute! I love him
Good book, good company ‚ù§
Reading Harry Potter in German?
And he knows German
I love him!
He is So cute!!
You mean Guillermo?
Sehr freundlich.
Rats are underappreciated.

About the only thing I don't like about them is the very short lifespans.
You have rats
Are you sure his name is not Peter Pettigrew?
I absolutely love rats but my roommate doesn't think the same. As a mouse parent, I envy you
Hi Gizmo, hope you and your owner Had a great Christmas
Welches Buch liest du?

Rats are certainly better than ferrets. Anything that poops in the corners is bad news

Hi, Gizmo!
Willard now that was one freaky movie
Does he know how to cook? Ps Battle

Hell yeah bill that‚Äôs solid rat
It almost doesn‚Äôt even look real. 

Reminds me of the cute little guy on The Suicide Squad
Sehr bezaubernd!
I really like rats
good name
Tale of Deaperaux vibes
Hello gizmo may you and your owner enjoy your time together.
What a precious photo and sweet face!
I love this so much.
Does he/she read to you?
I think he should be renamed Worf.
Gizmo is cute, but it reminds me of my cousin's deceased hamster :( 

(Im completely aware that i may end up in r/NobodyAsked
Is Gizmo posing or is that a little taste test?
At least, I don't think that it is going to climb the Christmas tree and knock it down.  We have long since had nothing but plastic decorations on the tree for obvious reasons.  This year, we got a much smaller tree as all the gifts seem to be gift cards anyways.  Boy oh boy, he was in a really bad mood about that and took it out on my brother's gentle as a lamb seeing eye guide dog as often as possible.  This was a great Christmas!
German Harry Potter‚Ä¶W√ºnderbar!
U got nothing on inosuke
Rat at the top of r/all, today is a blessed day ‚ù§ also Gizmo is so adorable üòç
I heard or mice but not rats, anyhow, how are they as pets ?
I worry that Gizmo doesn‚Äôt know I love him.
Does he bite?
Was liest du?

‚ÄúFather, will you read me a story?‚Äù
I have limited German vocabulary, but I can tell that‚Äôs Harry Potter you‚Äôre reading immediately. Cute rat!
How cute!!
I don‚Äôt like rats, but this gizmo gave me Stuart little vibes and now I‚Äôm crying in happiness thinking of the little chat you‚Äôd have with gizmo about this book chapter like Stuart little would ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
i love rats!!!
But can he cooks though?
Some mice got into my moms bird food and I took them off the property and let them go today and I have a new appreciation for mice and rats now. They‚Äôre beautiful little creatures.
Don‚Äôt get him wet!
Thats a rat?   Adorable.  They look so much more fearsome when they‚Äôre running along the subway lines or out from between dumpsters and buildings in the city.
Is he a good cook?
I‚Äôm so afraid of rats for some reason
Hi Gizmo ü•∫
Gizmo for President! Which country? All of them!
So adorable ü§©üòç

So does gizmo root for scabbers while you read Harry Potter together?

A perfect rat doesn‚Äôt exis‚Ä¶
First time ever seeing a rat doesn‚Äôt give me that nasty feeling. He‚Äôs kinda cute
Well he can't be all that smart or he would be reading the book from the printed side.  He is cute tho..
Sehr suss!
I may be wrong but are you reading Harry Potter?
Awe the cutest page turner ever
Rats are, by definition, not cute
Welches Buch liest du?

He looks like he suggested that book for you and wants to make sure you‚Äôre enjoying it.
He looks very polite.
Swiss German text in that book?
Immer sch√∂n hier Deutsche zu sehen! Und Gizmo ist zu cute!
They look very cute and polite. My German is rusty, but that looks like you‚Äôre reading ‚ÄúPrisoner of Azkaban‚Äù! Looks like a perfect evening in.

What is his favorite meal to cook for you?
Hi, Gizmo!

What a cute little boy. Really wished they lived longer. I've always wanted a rat.
Hey gizmo wassup
GIZMO!
He looks very polite!
Awww so cute
He looks like he's gonna chomp your book lol
I think I would legitimately enjoy having a pet rat, but losing a best friend every few years would destroy me.
