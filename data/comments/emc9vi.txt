Where do i go to get my dog twin?
I know that hairy doofus! (The human, not the dog). He literally just texted me this link.

Edit: This a proud moment. This is my newest top comment and it's about my friend and his new pup.
There's no such thing as the perfect cou--  

Nevermind.
This is going to be hard to top as the best thing I'll see all day.
I saw a shirt that has a drawing of a grumpy cow saying suck my tiddies and now this. Not a bad Thursday.
I think I love them both
I know the beard is the focal point here on his face, but this guy has beautiful eyes. Very kind looking, like from the inside out.
Matching white patch in their "fur" is so cute! Love them!
[deleted]
You know how they say dogs look like their owners....

Skyrim had a quest involving a dog that looked like that.  Can't remember its name.  The dog talked, and I always felt the voice actor they chose was dead-on -- he sounded just like what I'd imagine that kind of dog sounds like.

Also where can I get that beanie?
Ok I give up-------- which one is the dog
I call them
Bowsers, I dunno it just sounds right
This dog looks so much like my old family dog who unfortunately passed away the summer before last. 

Still miss you, Gandalf.
They deserve each other. Couple weirdos.
He looks like a guy who used to be famous and then decided to grow his beard so we cant recognize him.
He looks like most of the dogs from skyrim. Did he name him Barbas?
