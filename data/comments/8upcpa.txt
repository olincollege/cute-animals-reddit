It's a dog-teddybear! I never knew i needed something in my life this much. 
My friend has a German shepherd and a golden retriever. Now I know what they would look like if they crossed.

They're both dudes though. But it doesn't stop them from trying! 
[Here is an adult](http://www.sheprescue.org/images/Inga%20von%20%20Innsbruck%20face.jpg)
Holy cuteness he got all the right traits 
German retriever?
As adorable as it is, this is not a great cross. Generally they don‚Äôt know whether to herd or retrieve. I know it sounds stupid but it will be a very hyper pupper.
My golden shepherd has a different look to [her](https://i.imgur.com/BDjoyUq.png) 
Here's my [German Shepherd, Golden Retriever and Husky](https://imgur.com/a/wfg0ZsL) Mix
Just adorable üòç I also have a German Shepherd/Golden Retriever mix, and he looks completely different! Black fur with a white chest patch up to his chin, floppy ears. Half of his litter was golden and the other half pure black like him!

It's a Golden Shepherd!
That is a goood precious pup! üò≠üò≠üò≠
Very cute. Growing up I had a German shepherd - Collie mix. She was beautiful and placid. And not as furry as you think.
Golden floof
Those Golden Shepherd ears are the best.
omg. my best friends dog growing up was this mix. Sure miss that dog. üò≠
I have one as well. Was such a big fluffy furball when he was a pup. Best dog I‚Äôve ever owned.
Am ded.
This is my Golden Shepherd boy of 4 years! https://ibb.co/jROE2J
If its name is anything other than Rupert, I would be utterly disappointed. 
Cuteness Over*lord.*
I need to upvote this multiple times, how do I do it??????
SO cute, but OMG THE SHEDDING!!
It looks cute, but any health hazards?
Perfect mutt. 
A Golden Shepherd, a German Retriever? What do we call that fluff?!
Wwwaaaannt!!
Now I want one 
Whats the personality on him/her
Ya know... I've never been a big fan of goldens but damn near everything PLUS golden is better. It just looks both cuter and smarter. And it's probably way friendlier.

Dammit I want a goldendoodle...
Oh dear god. 
UGH. MY FEED HAS BEEN BLESSED. 
[deleted]
I have 2 male long haired german sheps who has some goldens ?
IN LOVE! Look at that fur! It must be so so SO SOFT! I would so buy a plush version of him (I decided it‚Äôs a him without checking the comments) so I could hug him every day. What a perfect dog.

 I would name him . . . Paddington. Or maybe Archie. Louie? Clive. Dexter. No, Paddington. Full name always no shortening allowed. No Paddy or Tony or um Ding. Ok maybe Ding for short on occasion. That‚Äôs kinda cute.
Here I might be very unpopular, but both breeds have a tendency for bad hip joints.

So the dog might be cute and all, but what about its later years.

I am all for cross breeding healthy dogs, but since many dogs have genetic problems it seems irresponsible to me to cross two dogs with the same kind of problem.

Just my two cents 
Our golden shepherd has a constant smile and loves everything. High energy and obsessive about fetching. Think ADHD overdrive. Must be exercised daily. We ‚ù§Ô∏è him! 
Looks like a teddy graham
He attacc & he snugg, he cute as a love bug
So fluffy
I need this dog!  Or any dog.  Darn NYC apartments being so small...
Such fluff! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
My dog is the same mix but she‚Äôs the color of a German Shepherd and has golden retriever ears
I've got a [golden retriever/boarder collie](https://imgur.com/a/Q7qq6LN) mix. You mix a golden retriever with anything and its cuteness overload. 
Hello everyone! 
Here is some info about this beauty. First, she's not my dog (unfortunately üò≠). The pic was posted by a vet clinic in Quebec. The dog's name is Maya and she's at the vet for her first vaccines! I've seen posts saying that she's not a German shepherd/golden mix but the vet clinic confirms she is! She's the most perfect dog I've seen (after my golden boye of course!).
Honestly I think anything fluffy mixed with a German Shepherd is going to be gorgeous. We have a German-Australian mix and we‚Äôre straight up obsessed with her. The most beautiful dog.
Golden shepherd or German retriever? The world may never know.
How do you all deal with the shedding of a German Shepherd? I think they‚Äôre the perfect dog other than that con. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stand having hair on me all the time. Any suggestions? 
Lil fluff ball
Adorable. Sounds like the perfect personality combo too. Both breeds are known for intelligence & loyalty. Of all the mixed breeds how am I just now hearing/thinking about a golden shepard?
Is there a sub for random dog mixes?
Here's My golden shepherd. https://imgur.com/gallery/mXgCKgP
I‚Äôll take all you have in stock 
That dog is just going to drag a lot of guys named Clause and Helmut home. 
His fucking name better be Teddy.
Incredibly cute!
Look dude, I‚Äôm all for the cutest of shits, but you can‚Äôt go making me cry at a whiskey bar in front of my friends ok?
German Retriever or Golden Shepherd?
My friend has this mix but it has german shepard colours and golden retriever shape to it. So cute.
Golden shepard?
It‚Äôs a cute dog, take my upvote
Oh my goshhh
He is such a good boy!!! 
Is this a common outcome between these two breeds? Cuteness overload
Golden shepherd, German retriever
The perfect good boy doesn't exi...
He looks like a bear 
You shouldn't do this... Now I want another dog! 
Flufffffffyyyyy

i have a german shepherd/ golden retriever mix, she looks nothing like this. she has the ears of a retriever, snout of a german shepherd and the bark of one too. also she‚Äôs completely black.
Perfect mutt. 
No that's actually a BearFox. They're extremely rare. Lucky duck. 
A Golden Shepherd, a German Retriever? What do we call that fluff?!
Omg too cutee 
OMFG ITS SO CUTE
üòç how beautiful

Doge is cuter
That is 100&#37; the cutest puppy i have ever seen in my life. 
Oh no, someone put the wrong texture on that German Sheperd model.

Gotta be fake! It's not possible to be that cute! üòç 
Can I have the location of this dog? No reason..
My dog growing up was the same mix. He looked nothing like this! This is one reason why I love mixed breeds. He looked like a bear.
What a handsome hound. Here is my Golden Shepherd, [Bilbo Doggins](https://i.imgur.com/1yYdEmP.jpg).
Damn that is one S H I N Y P O K E M O N B O Y E
It looks like the face and color of a golden retriever was photoshopped onto the body of a german shepherd
I wonder if they eat like a german shepherd or golden retriever. 
I wonder if he realizes how many people think he's cute. What cutie pie! \^\_\^
I saved this image, but the truth is that this image saved me 
I also have a german shepherd x golden retriever.. I got a complete opposite to this pupper. He's got floppy ears and is black lol so weird how genetics work
This is my boy Sarge, I love his mix of traits. He makes an excellent family dog, totally mellow and low energy. But he's also very playful and affectionate to everyone he meets. And beyond loyal, people assume he's just well trained but in reality he is just good natured.

Such a cutie but watch out for hip problems. Both breeds are very prone to it :/

It's an Arian Retriever! 

Sorry, couldn't resist.
It's like if Christian Bale was blonde.
This dog loudly and ferociously barks at strangers and then gently holds their hand in their mouths and leads them away.
One loyal stubborn boi.
A GOOD BOY 
My wife and I have been searching for one with these looks forever. 
What do they look like when they aren't puppies anymore?
OMG so adorable 
I'd love to have a pup like that some day. It's so handsome üòç
What a beautiful dog
TOTAL cuteness overload. Like cuteness x 1000!
So cute it looks fake!
It‚Äôs a golden Shepard.
He looks like he would be the live action version of an anime puppy! Really cute
Those knobby puppy knees! :))) 
German Shepard and chow mix is even cuter but I may be biased
adorable!
The Golden Shepherd.
That is one mad cute dog. Love em!
What a cutie üòç
Dog shall be a lovely and, most likely, energetic ball o floof.
I think I literally died of cute for a second just now.
I never knew how bad I wanted a Golden Shepherd til this very second
Super boopable snoot!!!!

Best of both breeds!!!!
Gimme a break holy fuck that's the most cute dog I've ever seen!
Those ears are the cutest thing. I just want to rub them on my cheek.
Wow that dog is so beautiful!
I also have a German/golden mix. Nice dog, never barks. I was letting the cat out one day, and he walked in and layed down. His owners were tired of him jumping the fence and were going to take him to the pound(he was a rescue). We gladly took him in.
Comment from my wife, "IT'S SO FLUFFY!!!" I think I need to find a gif of that girl from Despicable Me.
Isn't it great how the cutest things make us pull the ugliest faces?
He looks like Paddington!!!
Looks like it could belong perfectly in a Disney movie 
It looks cute, but any health hazards?
Golden shepherd
I can‚Äôt stop staring. So adorable üò©

At what point do the ears become wings
OMGG hes adorable.

Ok that's the cutest dog I've ever seen. You should get a prize or something. 
Golden shepherd or German retriever? 
Look at those shepherd ears with the golden snoot. My heart just melted. 
That might just be the cutest dog I've seen, 10/10 would cuddle.
That human expression!!!
This is enough cuteness for the month üòçüòç
My mom has a golden retriever german shepherd mix rescue dog that she adopted when he was two. This is amazing because we have no puppy pictures of him, but I'm sure he looked totally like this when he was a pup!
In a constant state of surprise. Absolutely adorable.
What a beauty!! üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è
Cute puppie
What a cute good boy :3
My first dog was this type of mix, but he turned out like a redhead with slight german shepherd browning on the edges. 
german retriever or golden shepherd? ilike both names! anyway , he is cuuuute!
The shedding on that dog would be monstrous 
goldies are the best

That is the most pure and precious creature on the planet
The golden German. The Arian dog 
Imagine the intelligence and loyalty of a shepherd and the loving silliness of a retriever 
I have a golden retriever now and I‚Äôve always wanted a German shepherd. I need a dog like this. It‚Äôs so beautiful. 
This is like the first stage of a Pokemon. Will get more badass, but still beautiful.
Wow! He is a beauty! Name? 
Look at those ears. Will you LOOK AT THOSE EARS! ü§ó
I have quite a much dog like this but it's 2/4 shepherd 1/4 golden retriever and the rest a husky
Omg so cute

Holy jesus!!!!!
Looks so fabulous. Would like to see this puppy when he is fully grown

Anyone feel like this looks like star fox?
What an adorable pup
The Irish Guide Dogs use a lot of different mixes; retriever and german shepherd is one of the mixes and those guys are SO CLEVER. Also, they can get remarkably big! Like, bigger than a standard of either breed for some reason. 
PUPPY!

Like the German Shepherd remained as it is EXCEPT for he sweetness and looks that is mixed with the Golden Retriever! 

Golden Pup!
Oooooohhhhh this is too much! Now I‚Äôm wondering what it‚Äôs cartoon voice will be like.
I have a GSD + Yellow Lab mix. Amazingly smart dog with the most even temperament. She's going on 13 but continues to be healthy barring some sluggishness. 

How is the general temperament and health of GSD + ~~Floof~~ golden retriever mix? 
My first words were 'oh ffs'...what a beauty.
Can't imagine the amount of love he'd get outdoors
Do you call that a Golden Shepherd or a German Retriever?
I have 2 beautiful boys with a similar mix. Father was a 115lb big fat golden and the mom was a little German Shepherd/Husky mix. My boys look nothing like this, and they look nothing alike. If I knew how to upload pictures to Reddit I'd share
The best of both breeds; gorgeous! 
The Golden Shepherd, they speak of him in hushed tones.
This is amazing I‚Äôm from Ireland and live very close to the guide dog Centre.

We‚Äôve puppy walked

(homed,loved and trained a puppy from 6 weeks to 12 months when they are taken in for training and matched with a blind person)
 4 dogs who were have all gone on to service.

I am involved with them 16 years and I have never seen a retriever Shepard cross like this...

SOOOOO CUTE
Sooo fluffy!!! 
wow! such greatness! 
German Retriever.
I have one of these! I call him my "Golden Shepherd." üòÇüòÇ
Is that a Golden Shepherd or a German Retriever?
I have one!!!!  Best dog ever! Mine has shepherd markings with long coat like a golden. 
Woof, those paws are ginormous! 
The Most Superior Breed. 
That will be one shedding machine.
Give me every dog with golden retriever coat 
My neighbor has a poodle golden retriever mix.   Absolutely the most adorable pooch I've ever seen. Looks just like this dog except with curly hair
So.... so majestic!!
If you don't name him lion then you're lyin to yourself
Looks like a good student 
Great mix.
I had a GS cross black lab, such an awesome dog. He's gone now but I still love him. His name was Zulu. 
My God...
Wow, it looks almost like a cartoon version of what a awworthy dog should look like.
This definitely needs to be a breed.
That golden is so powerful. 
My golden doodle is 3/4 poodle, but looks straight up like a tiny golden retriever. 
Does it retrieve sheeps?
beautiful pup
It‚Äôs a golden shepherd!!!
This dog is adorable! He got the best of both worlds with both breeds. I must have one of these.
That should be banned for extreme cuteness and eyeball overload üòç
Oh my goodness... what an adorable mix.

Now I'm curious.. 

Gsd's personality is very protective of their owners and home while Golden's are basically "come on in! Let me show you to where they stash the expensive jewellery and the safe" 


What would these be like?
It's so cute! Want to pet it so much.
Absolutely adorable!
Golden shepherd ? German retriever??? 
Imagine the dust bunnies it can chase.
It's beautiful ;(
This dog will murder you with love 
Golden shepherd fur machine.

How does this work? Most times when dogs like this breed you get a mix of puppies being more like one or the other rather than being 50/50
Hes gonna be the bestest of boys
Wow
A golden shepherd. So beautiful.

I'm sorry, as an expert I can tell you that is definitely an ewok.

You know, I'm straight, but can really see what a handsome man he is.

Pure bred? Natural is basically impossible unless both were retarded
That's simply amazing.

Pleasee you have to get this breed going! I want one as soon as possible!

So is she a Golden Shepherd or a German Retriever?
My dog is a white German Shepherd- Golden Retriever mix. She is 14 and the absolute best. Her name is Abby! 
This pupper may be the most adorable I've ever seen
This is pretty much what my dog looks like. She's a Golden-Chow. You can mix goldens with pretty much anything and they come out looking cute!
So adorable! How old? Looks like a puppy
Fluff-ball of cuteness.
I WANT IT!!!
I think I died when I looked at this how perfect is this doggy!‚ù§Ô∏è
Awww, so cute. I love the ears! 
Extra obidient boye.

Exactly the mix I want. Husband wants golden retriever and I want a GS... this solves all of our fighting! GIMME.
Those ears üòç Doggie genetic jackpot!
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeee
Oh my god this needs to become a full fledged out breed. 
I bet this dogs a shedding machine!
Combining the loving friendliness of a golden retriever with the screw you I want to bite something nature of a German Shepherd.  I like it, extremely intelligent and motivated.
Dog Goals!!!
Anyone else want a dog after this?
Where did you get the dog from

Too bad that buddy will probably get tumors and have bad hips. RIP
Goodest boi in Da town 
Very cute! I like not-common crosses because you get new types of personalities. 

He reminds me of my Golden Husky, a Goldie with the body of a Husky, White facial markings like a Husky, but with the hair and color of a regular Golden. While he was perfect when it was time to get his leash or harness on for a walk, he was something of a supermodel in looks and personality. He could be dumb sometimes, but he was hyper focused. But he loved cuddling with people and cats both. 

He actually shined in sunlight, so his name was a tribute to Ramses. 
Any downside to the breed/mix? 
Can you please post and update when this beautiful pupper is fully grown? 
I saw one of these guys today, cutest dog I have EVERRRR seen bro
Beautiful 
That won‚Äôt be any trouble at all

I guess the breeder will get 12.000 orders by tomorrow. F.... Docking business. 
Makes me miss my German Shepherd/husky/wolf mix, Bala. She had to be put down last summer because of multiple strokes. I love my current boye so much but she was one of the most beautiful dogs I've ever seen and so special in my heart. The tough girl lived to be 17. 
/r/INEEEEEDIT or /r/INEEEDIT  or something. I need this.
I met a golden/shepherd mix once, when I worked at the zoo.  People always brought their dogs, thinking they could walk them around the park, so the zoo installed a kennel facility so no one would leave them in the car.  Normally we got teeny toy breeds, but one day we got this beautiful mix.  She looked similar to the pic, but had the pale buff coloring of a light-colored shep, with a faint brown mask and floppy ears.

One of the softest, gentlest looking dogs I'd ever seen.  And everyone in the kennel area was scared of her because she was big.  On top of that... she was smart as hell, and would get the kennel door open within minutes of being put in.  This led to a lot of screaming teenage girls running from the kennel/ticket building.

I ended up sitting with her, since we couldn't keep her contained.  My job that day was to play with a dog, and it was the best work day I've ever had.
Yeah, but...some fucked up shit had to have happened for that thing to exist
I want 3.
Strange but really cute. 
Is it okay if I say " I don't want such? They are good breeds but the mix ? No, " ?
That's not real 
Im here to ask the important question... Is this a German Retriever or a Golden Shepherd?
I never knew I needed this until now
That‚Äôs amazing! I‚Äôve always going golden retrievers to be some of the best dogs I‚Äôve ever had. They are usually really tender and if you make them right, it can be enough for a few days! A German Shepard mix would mean you get even more out of it with those nice strong shoulders. Great pick! And I hope you have a great time preparing it!
All modern dogs fly in the face of God (so to speak) : I.E. They should not exist they are mutants created by man. Many breeds have health problem due to overbreeding and likely this ones chances are extra compromised. Not cute to me. 
Would a golden shepard mix nkt be as smart as a shepard husky mix
It looks cute and all, but does it have any effect on the dog's health? I'm not an expert but doesn't mixing breeds have bad effects?
Gimme
My head is going to explode. What an adorable pupper.
omfgawwwwwd
The goodest of boyes
That‚Äôs the coolest dog I‚Äôve ever seen, I want one.
I have a yellow lab/wiener dog mix. Love him so much! 
Retriever shepherd! N7 doggo. 
"You still don't know what you're dealing with, do you? The perfect organism."

Seriously, though. This might be my favorite doggo ever. 
O holy hell I just squeeled a little haha. 
I want one and like now.  Just take my money. 
That is one adorable pupper!
Now does it take after the Shepherd or the Retriever?
How much would a mix like this cost? Adorable overload!!!
OMFG!

This might actually solve the German Shepherd‚Äôs overbreeding issues where they aim to get the lower back in triangle shape.
I have a pure bred golden and also German Shepard. I never thought of them being mixed but damn that dog is adorable. 
Oh boy! Now this is a very smart mix! Can you tell us more about the doggo‚Äôs personality? Is it a family doggo or a hunter doggo? Ect
Viscous but will snuggle you to death

This is mathematically the average dog in my household.  I have a golden and a shepherd - now kinda thinking I should have gone for the combo! üòÜ

Was one of the characters in Isle of Dogs, it seems. 
This should be a recognized dog breed 
[deleted]
Is that... legal?
Hes so beautiful,  that should be its own new breed. Would be a great name, a dog with German mix that's the color of a nice beer...
I have one of these! Female german and a male golden for parents, 3 litters and they ALL look like their mother with the german sheapard hair. Some were thin like her and some were fat/thick like their father

Do they shed?

Very nice how much?
Anyone know a breeder of these? 
these mixed breeds are getting ridiculously cute. Similar with mixed breed human babies 
I am not a biologist so please answer this: 

Is this dog stupid/2 + stupid/2 stupid based on its halves, or stupid squared? 
That‚Äôs just wrong!!! Mixing breed especially when golden retriever is involved causes so many health problems for the dog as he grows
Only half Racist 
No
