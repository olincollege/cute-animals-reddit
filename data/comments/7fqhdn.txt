This is not a place for political discussions.
This is heartwarming but all I can think about is how big that dude’s shoes are
I love Leonard, I met him once at Walmart in baton rouge and he was more than happy to take a photo with me. Also saw him a bunch of times on campus, super chill guy.

I know someone who took a class with him and fournette saw that he had shitty headphones, so he brought him in a pair of beats since he had a ton of them, because he was just that genuine of a guy. Didn't expect anything from it, fournette just liked that my friend treated him like a normal guy.
Grey shirt has to be dad or older brother he looks exactly like the kid 
That's a superstar who appreciates fans.  That's how you do it...
I'm sure someone else has mentioned it, but he's very active in the community and with donations. 

he melted down a bunch of trophies and turned them into a weight set for a Jacksonville high school.

Its amazing how 45 seconds of a humans day can give someone happiness and a story to tell for life. Heartwarming for sure.
I went to LSU at the same time as Fournette. He's a truly great guy 
So the original post got removed because the imgur link had the source (instagram) link in it so lets do this all over again!

**Edit:**  Just to fill everyone in, this is Leonard Fournette who plays for the Jacksonville Jaguars.  He is pretty well known for donating to charities and giving back to the fans.  Good to see him continuing to do these types of gestures.
I don't know why, but sports people doing stuff like this always fills my heart with more joy than if a regular celebrity did it.
What a sweet and friendly Jaguar.
Leonard Fournette is now my favorite NFL player
What a classy gesture. He seems to really enjoy giving back, too.
I went to a rival highschool of Fournette and met him several times around New Orleans and highschool football games, awesome dude!
Why are people debating the usefulness of a gift? Obviously the guy receiving it felt it was a good gift, why the debate? He's giving him signed shoes not a cookware set
I've seen this many times with professional athletes and it never fails to tug at my heart strings.  Fournette is a class act.  I hope he has a long and successful career in the NFL.  Tremendous of him to give that fan such a moment to remember. 
Aw, Leonard Fournette is such a nice guy. Geaux Tigers!
Now I'm crying in a coffee shop researching jobs.

edit: I have a job, just looking for better! 
Wow, that is a face of pure happiness.
He’s a Jaguar, so it belongs on r/aww
r/humansbeingbros
That's awesome.

Seems like a cool guy shame there aren't more people like him in the world. 
I love to see things like this. Some people truly do have empathy and compassion.
So cool. The look on the kids face is priceless. 
This is the correct way for pro athletes to be role models. Like a great teacher, they have the ability to inspire.
Classy guy.
Im curious why this happened/if it's common/where the shoes came from. 

Do NFL players do this a lot and I'm not aware of it? Are there extra shoes and markers lying around for this to happen? Does someone tell someone who tells him this fan is here? Does anyone know?
Nice to see such class from my running back. Earlier in the season after Hurricane Irma, he spent his off day helping deliver food and water too. Wasn't a PA move but dude genuinely wanted to help out. 
Good man. 
What makes this more amazing to me is the Jags just lost a close game and Fournette had a poor statistical game but he still thought to this. 

What an amazing guy. 
Wow i hope i can bring that much joy to people one day.
I love Leonard Fournette so fucking much.
What a fucking guy! There is still good in the world, people. Have to remember that. 
Its beautiful how an act of kindness can change someone's day. This made mine.
Shit like this melts my heart. 
Fuck this shit gets me all emotional.... always love to see professional athletes giving back. 
Nothing like the moment when the people you think of as heroes come up and prove they deserve it. A simple act but not everyone has the class to care. Very cool of the player.
Glad he’s on my fantasy football team, he can underperform all he wants now. No more cursing his name on bad games
Aww, nice!
People like me get mad about how much athletes make. But then there are the guys like this who make me forget that and realize there are some awesome, caring people out there. 
Fournette is a fuckin monster of a man. It blows my mind that he’s a rookie when he looks and plays like he’s been in the league for 5 years already. 
I just find it amazing that a moment that Fournette will probably not think of much ever or consider a big deal will be something this kid cherishes for the rest of his life.
That's the nicest thing I've seen all day.
You know, I find myself generalizing NFL players as having an "better than you" attitude however videos like this remind me that there are goodhearted, caring players in the league.
Good guy Lenny.
Here is the bigger problem I have with this and it is a strange one. This is the kind of thing we should be showing these days. We should show when someone does this and make someones...year. We should be showing that athletes, celebrities and people in the spot light are good people. But instead all we want to focus on is the bad, the horrible things people do. Or the complete, self absorbed assholes who dominate social media. I would rather see this a thousand times over than have to see one second of a Kardashian. Seriously, this makes me pull for the Jags even more to make the playoffs.
r/wholesome
I’m crying while devouring a rainbow roll...
he’s like get the fuck out of here !! no way! this is awesome 
Sort of ironic giving him shoes. 
I’m not crying, you’re crying...
Haha, awesome! That face is pure gold.
Cam Newton did this last year too. Sure he can be a real ass sometimes, but he's always good to kids and fans.

https://youtu.be/mbwtTBzDfpI
Please save your bs edgy comments. Dude is so happy it’s contagious.
So cool. 
 As the asshole that I am, I wanted to post something vile. However, after numerous views, and seeing the young man's face light up, I gotta give props to Fournette. That's what a role model looks like.  Also, go Vikes!
Classy move
That dude stole the ball straight from him. Good thing we got it on video. 
NICE CAT
Is he a fan for life because hes going to die soon ?
Made me tear up. So sweet... 
amazing. thanks for turning the day brighter!
Shut up...you're the one crying.
I see what you did OP. That title is fucked up. 
I love how he just looks past everyone as he makes his way to her to make her day. Go Jags!
What a classy move. This made me cry and smile at the same time. 
Can someone explain what's happening in the video? I can't see because there's a ton of water in my eyes. 
His reactions are so happy it moves me.
thanks for the athletes foot
That dude is so stoked!!! I love this
Awesome
I'm not one to care about football (much less any sport), but seeing the amount of happiness from this fan is causing my eyes to sweat profusely.
[deleted]
Man can you imagine being that happy?
fournette is a boss
 Nice! 
Man. That was good. Dude looked so happy. Well done Fournette.
Faaaack, this made me feel so good. People are alright sometimes. Mutual admiration society.
What a Jag!
I LOVE this so much! Seriously 10 seconds could change someone’s outlook on life. Look at Tyler Perry when he met Oprah as he was a janitor at her hotel. Now he’s worth like half a billion dollars. I’m not saying a football player can cure an illness, I’m saying he could be the spark that ignites a fire for hope. 
These always make me fucking cry. Some people are too goddamn good for this world.
nice
I’m not crying. I’m sweating through my eyes. 
Here you go kid, don't wear 'em out.
Let's send the jags much needed good karma
That's my running back
beautiful
Looking at this makes me so happy! 
Love this guy. Just as good a dude as he is a player. I doubted the pick when the Jags drafted him, but boy am I glad to have been wrong about it. 
Legit man. **RESPECT**
Now I'm a fan too. 
you have fame and fortune, what better than to make sometimes day (life)
Godammit!  Don't you make me like the Jaguars!

All kidding aside, Fournette seems like a good dude!

How can I root for him while still hating the Jags?
I got a little teary.
This is one of those times where I wish I could upvote til my thumb bleeds
How does this not put a smile on someones face
Is there a MadeMeTearUp subreddit?
Brings tears to the eyes
Such a cool dude. Came into our car dealership a few weeks ago. Proud he represents Jax. 
That makes my heart warm and fuzzy. There really is some good in the world. 
I HATE football, but I'm now a fan of this player.
Goddammit my room is full of onions again. Fucking onion-cutting ninjas.
That is something special. Thank you sir, for seeing people some people overlook. 
I love Leonard Fournette. 
Up vote this people. We all need to see some good.
Not a sports fan. So, I don't know who that guy is. But holy shit is he a saint.
I’m not crying you’re crying!
/r/Imnotcrying
awww omygosh this made me tear up!
Well, tears now. 
Awesome
Such a small thing for the player to do that means so much to the fan.  Good work, Mr. Footballer.
this made me so happy
FOURNETTE!!! Glad to see him making it to the front page for this 😭😭😭
Even as a Razorback fan, I always respected him at LSU, very classy guy 
Heart breaking game as a Jags fan, but this is super dope. 
I love this
That's awesome, what a great dude
Damn that makes me happy :)
First thing I've seen in a while that legit made me smile, good job.
Truly amazing
That's so cool. Not only does fournett get me a shitload of fantasy points, he's also a class act. 
Omg... that was so great!

Leo is an amazing ambassador for the Jags.
We need more of this in the NFL and the world.
The way he backs his wheelchair up when he realizes LF is coming for him
Fan for life indeed. Both the kid and me. In fact, after seeing this short clip, I think he's now my 2nd favorite non-Eagles player, right behind JJ Watt.
Needed this. :)
Not a fan of Fournette when he was playing for LSU (Go Gators) but happy to have him with the Jaguars. 
I might be a Titans fan, but that's some classy stuff. Good on you, Fournette.
I am tearing up how sweettt!
BRB crying 
this gave me chills. faith in humanity restored. 😊
teared up a bit
Most heartwarming thing I have seen in a long time!
Yep, right in the feels.
Wow.... a heart of gold🙏 God bless him
this. is. awesome.
Amazing.

the world is such shit that me watching someone give their smelly game shoes to another person made me tear up. what a class act. made that dudes life. 
[removed]
fucking awesome
There are good hoomans in this world. 
A hero for life
Thanks, I think we all needed that 
Wow!  This is great!  So much joy.
He plays for my home team!
This is so pure.
Glad for explanation.  I had written about his caring, loving, kindness. Guess that was removed.
Such a relief that he didn't pat/rub that guy on the head
Fucking awesome 
Best part for me is he gave him both shoes! 
I fucking love sports. 
good guy fournette
This guy is awesome.
I got a little teary.
Man, when people use their powers for good.
This is freaking awesome. I wonder if sports stars ever understand how BIG this is in someone’s life
Not only tremendously talented, but a good guy to boot. That is a rare and beautiful thing. 
Christian bale in “the fighter 2”
Every time I've pretty much lost faith in humanity I see something like this and it's just... Slightly restored, if only momentarily.
Why am I crying in the club right now?
Is the title a joke because it's unlikely he will live very long? I honestly can't tell
[deleted]
Why would he give him shoes? Poor guy can't even walk.

Good guy Omar
How can I be mad about him only getting 42 yards after seeing that? 
Hope he takes good care of them and doesn’t ruin them by walking around in them.

Obligatory happiness established. 
>a fan for life. 

.. like you mean they're gonna die soon or what
Cystic fibrosis. Not even once.
Wonderfully kind gesture from a very kind man. But maybe give him your gloves or something he can.. uh.. use
have y'all considered just letting this kid live his life instead of fawning over how "inspiring" this is or how it "made your day"?

edit: I'm also disabled, not just here to rain on your parade for shits and giggles, so y'all wanna tell me why you think this kid's any different for being in a chair instead of downvoting me because you don't wanna think about your ableist attitudes?
Jesus Christ that’s adorable. I’ve always dreamed of being Rich enough to give to the handicapped. I feel like if you are Rich then you should donate to charity and not buy $1,000,000 watches and cars. 
Guy can’t walk, he gets shoes. 
That’s awesome but come on: it’s kind of funny that he gave cleats to a guy in a wheelchair. Hopefully the recipient and Fournette both appreciate the irony haha
[deleted]

Are those used shoes?  They must stink. 
All 2 days of it.
I was hoping he'd take off his jersey too. The guy probably would have flipped out even more!
[removed]
[removed]
It's about time Eleven got something to help with those nose bleeds

But seriously, amazing gesture. 
No one cares about the NFL. 
For life because he looks like he has some kind of degenerative disease and is going to die soon?
[removed]
[deleted]
That's probably not that long. 
At the start of this gif, I definitely thought he was going to be just stealing someone's marker.
[removed]
he looks so old haha
Mfw I nut but she keep suckin
I love everything about this post, other that the fact that it is Leonard Fournette and that he played for a college that killed their mascot with cancer 
He just took my god damn sharpie
I see a lot of wholesome posts. The fact that he scooted back in his chair and moved forward made me think he was very familiar with the world from a wheel chair. This was an eye stinger. 
wait this isn't fake CGI, because that is what this looks like.
i
Holy shit is that guy behind him, the dude in the famous wtf Jaguars fan gif?
