I did not know that I needed a camel hug until this very moment.
That looks like a solid hug
I never have seen a camel curve their neck like this. Great share.
I didn’t realize camels had that long of a neck. Reminds me of a giraffe almost.
I'll never understand why some people believe animals do not experience or comprehend emotion. They so clearly do.
There was a camel at a petting zoo once that took a liking to me. He put his mouth around my arm, but didn't bite, just kind of held it there. The next time I went there, he recognized me immediately, and came over and started making noises. I didn't have any food on me or anything, he just seemed to really like holding on to my arm.

Edit: Holy mother of God did this blow up.
for a sec I thought this was some amphibious fish eating a dude
Pet the damn camel
If this isn’t one of those things where they pretend it’s hugging him but actually it’s trying to suffocate him or some shit, it’s very cute
Wow! I’ve never seen an affectionate camel, so sweet!
Yo I was having a bad day until I saw this and it legit just incited some serotonin  or something
I did not know camels could bend their necks that much.
I’m no vegetarian but if a camel hugged me like that, I think I’d never eat camel meat again.
This video went viral in Saudi Arabia. The story that’s circling around is that the camel’s owner kid died a few days before, so he didn’t see the camel for a week. When he got back, the camel went to him and hugged him.

I don't know if the camel did it because it felt his sadness, but generally, even from my experience growing up with camels in Saudi, camels are really emotionally intelligent. They sense your emotions, and have complicated emotions themselves. If they love you, they’ll remember you forever, and will greet you every time they see you. But if they hate you, oh boy they won’t forget...
It is strange seeing a camel that isnt being an asshole lol
How beautiful
Hi I would like 1 camel hug, please.
Long neck animals apparently give the best hugs
I need to hug one now to test the theory
i wasnt aware i wanted a neck hug from a camel but i am now
Sand puppy
Damn man I just want a camel
There’s a story behind this, this guy is a Saudi influencer in travel industry, he lift for sometime and got stuck for quiet some time (COVID-19 situation you know) before getting back to his camels. 

On a side note, here is an interesting fact (at least for me): female camel cries (literally) when her baby camel dies! Glad that my country is known for this beautiful creature <3
Awwweee sincerity
There is this rescue zoo in my area that opened recently and I decided to stop and feed the animals. I went up to this one camels enclosure and he was a bit standoffish, understandable because they were rescues so I was speaking calmly and I put the food in the tray and he was warming up to me. He was staring but starting to be friendly to me. Another guest walked by and he was still trying to go for the food until he answered his cell. The mans deep voice freaked out the camel so badly he ran to the back as far as he could and would peek over the small hill to see if the man had gone. He was having crazy camel flashbacks like he was in a war. It was so sad!

 I’m glad he’s at a great zoo now though that actually cares about him.
At first it looked like he had half his body in some creature
That neck is like stretched taffy.
Warmed my heart in the morning, thanks!
TIL that camels can be heart-wrenchingly adorable.
The story is that the herder lost his son
I thought the camel had the guys head in his mouth >.<
I didn't realize camels were part snake. I know their necks are long but giraffes can't do that.
At first I thought that was a giant mouth swallowing the guy head first.  Took me a second.
/r/masterreturns
Animals loving humans gives me hope. Lots of hate in this world, but fundamentally, I love life.
It looked like a 4 legged animal was sucking on the guy's upper half
I've had a horse hug me this way. It's an amazing feeling having something that large gently embrace you around the neck. The weight of their neck and head is considerable but they rest on you without crushing you.
[deleted]
I thought that neck was a massive top lip, was like oh shit this guy been engulfed wtf
I guess this time going with a more realistic approach to the title? Last time I saw it the guy lost his family or something.
I never knew a camel could do that with its neck. 

Either way that looks like a great hug
Honestly at first I thought the camel swallowed him
I have a black greyhound, also affectionately known as a [shadow giraffe](https://imgur.com/a/ZwzL9Ta). 

He uses his long neck almost exactly like this. He will wrap his thunderously large neck around my side, look directly into my face and use his eyes to say "I am sad. Woe is me, a poor lowly greyhound. Will someone scratch my ears, call me a good boy, and give me treats?"

It works frustratingly often and I've even been 'interrupted' in a meeting while he decided that he wanted to sniff my desk, look around, and then yawn and walk off.

God I love having that goofus around :)
I want a camel cuddle.
So sweet. Awe don't leave him again sir.
I need a hug like this
I’m not crying, you’re crying
Wow, animals are my favorite beings.
Happy AL Habibi noises
Habibi
That looks like a wonderful hug!
So cute
A big bear camel hug!
The thumbnail is some vore shit.
til that their necks can do whatever the fuck that is
I need a camel hug.
CAMEL HUG!!!
for a second I thought it was some kind of mutant that was absorbing his head
“Please don’t make me carry fat tourists again”
At first, it looked like a huge mouth was wrapped around this guy and the camels neck was its lips
Long neck doggo
Wow, took my brain a moment to process that the neck was wrapped around.  In the interim I was seeing the camel with it's Jaw unhinged boa constrictor style and the herders entire head and much of their shoulders in it's mouth.
This is how my dog wishes he could hug me every time I enter the room
Animals have far greater emotions than most people think clearly.. I wouldn't even be surprised if **CRABS FELT PAIN**
We don’t deserve animals.
I'm not sure why but i've never seen a happy camel.
We don't deserve camels.
TIL camels necks can do that
Wasn’t this a camel comforting his owner after the loss of a loved one? That’s what I read last time.
Extra long hug. I bet thats some shit you gotta experience.
The Boa Camel strangles its prey before swallowing it. He will be stored with the others in the Boa Camel's spacious hump. The Boa Camel can subsist off of a single human for up to 5 months in this arid wasteland.
Camoo says dis my hooman. Git yer own! <3
camels are known to have a very strong memory.

there is a popular saying I heard "A camel never forgets".
Today I learned camels have very flexible necks.
i want a neck hug :(((
THEY CAN HUG WITH THEIR NECKS?!
I believe  the backstory was the camel herder just lost his mother and the camel had a 6th sense about it and was comforting him..
MERS
I thought camels just spit on people, no one told me they were handing out hugs.
omg I thought he was eating the dude at first
Snek nek
That's beautiful
I thought I saw something cursed for a second because of the way the camel's neck was wrapped around the guy.
Unconditional love!
why the long neck
"Yo so did you bring the white powder I asked for?"
I thought the camels neck was a weird alien creatures mouth and it was creepily eating that man...
Because of the horrors I find myself exposed to on a daily basis on the internet I first thought this man had is head in the camels ass, and I *hate* myself for that.
My mother: *walks in the kitchen to the sight of me eating bread at 1am*

Me: "Ever seen a camel hugging a person?"
I always forget they have long necks.
My biggest fear is that in reality it's "camel beat into submissive wrap" or something malicious.
sort of puts a different perspective on Arabic people, doesn't it?
Plot Twist: The camel is trying to suffocate the person but its too weak.
Anyone first see this as a camel with a really big head monching on the person?
Seems so peaceful and full of love
He must treat his herd well, with respect and love
Took me a second to realize that it wasn’t a grown man stuck halfway up a giant nostril.
Thats a weird snake
TIL that a camel is just a horse goose.
These two are definitely fucking
The camels actually constricting the guy so he can be eaten later, after wrapping him in the strong fat that is stored in the humps
awww I want a camel hug!
Okay idk if I'm just sleep deprived but my brain saw that guy waay inside that camels mouth
_you left me... You deserted me... But I'll choke you... SWEET REVENGEEE!!_
I thought the neck was lips, and the camel was just like: **SUCC**
Im caMELTING
Pure love.. It's melt my heart.
Camels, for when you can't decide if you want to buy a horse or a snake
We don’t deserve animals 😥❤️
In stark contrast to the [camel who probably called in an airstrike](https://imgur.com/RQWYJmv)
Am I the only one who sees the big-ass gun that guy appears to be holding??
I want one 🥺
I cry
Looks like he is saying come here let me talk to you about that water...
You know, I've never seen a camel up close. I have seen them, just never up close. I find this very heart warming.
And here I thought they just coughed up massive Camel loogie and spit in your face. Now I love Camels!
"Dont ever leave me, James!"
This kills the herder.
Thought that was a giant mouth eating the guy at first.
We don’t deserve animals.
Straight up thought this was a frog that had somehow fit a very large prey in its mouth. Sigh.
This is actually how camels asphyxiate their prey
Camel is just trying to check on its Anoos. Man just has to get in between.
Aw    who knew?
That hug says, "You are my best friend forever."
I felt the love there!
I'm not gonna lie, for a second I thought it was some creature with a person's head and shoulders in its mouth.
Dang, I need a Bro camel!
I imagine the camel saying, "I'm so glad you're back, this dingle dangle doesn't know what he's doing, everything has been terrible."
"Where were you? Habibi I missed you"
FEED ME MASTER
My heart 🥺🥺🥺
I legit thought that was a giant vacuum eating some guy's head at first
Even the herder's tail is wagging.
Bruh when im gone for a month I come back and my chiuaua is like: oh you're back? Nice   and goes to sleep
One time another animal did this to me... it was a snake
A Camel ~~Greeting~~ Strangling His Herder
Well I'm never eating camel again.
The man looks happy to see the camel.
At first i thought a mutant creature ate the man
I smell a schnoodledoodledoo
I want that hug.
Thought he was inside a huge mouth at first
So sweet, it put a hump in my throat.
I want this video. How do I get it?
I want to be kneck wrapped!
More like a 'I'm gonna get rid of my problem'-hug...
That neck looks like it's broken
:)
Reminds me of the \[swan hug\]([https://www.boredpanda.com/injured-swan-hugs-man-richard-wiese-born-to-explore-abbotsbury-swannery/](https://www.boredpanda.com/injured-swan-hugs-man-richard-wiese-born-to-explore-abbotsbury-swannery/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic)).
Did, I want to be hugged by a camel... Bad.
He looks like he’s about to choke him out.
Omg.🥰🥰
Mouth hugs are a different level
Lovely❤
Dem Neck Hugs.
Can you add one more pixel please? Just one?
I looked at this all wrong and thought the camel had a huge mouth and had consumed the herder up to his shoulders. Shouldve gone to Specsavers.
He needed that hug
At a petting zoo, a camel once took my dad's coke-bottle glasses right off his face.  5yo me thought it was the funniest shit ever. 28yo me thinks it's pretty silly too.
Dat neck dough
Unbelivable
I was going to make a terrorist joke, but this is just too sweet
Camel did a 180
Really the camel is like,

"Ha, choke hold! Die biiiitch!." Wtf, why is he still moving...
Til camels have flexible necks
My dog has this effect when I’m at work, but after 6 beers he wants nothing to do with me haha
We don't deserve animals
Absent like my father! Ha Ha ha ha... 🥲
That herder blended right in.

He's a camel-eon.
Clearly trying to infect the herder with MERS
You can tell he is a good heard master his animals love him
Looks like a hug that will never separate
What most people don't realize is that this "herder" is actually the owner of the herd, and that he was absent because he buried his son and was swamped because of the funeral arrangements.

The camel seems to have felt the sorrow and offended its condolences. 😪
Sorry, but did anyone else see an eyeless animal eating the man’s head at first?
really thought his head was in the camels mouth
The kind of hug we all need right now
Bro's got a neck on that sexy bod of his
I thought it was a giant frog eating a person 💀
Like a boneless neck?
I read this four times thinking it said Eating instead of greeting.
"HugDAYEEEE!"
What the fuck. Did not know they could move their necks like that.
Animals have such strong emotions , how precious 🥺🥺
Fucking hell I want a camel friend now
Aw das nice
Awwweee sincerity
The herder desert her.
... can the guy breathe? Can the camel breathe with its neck at that angle? Can ANYONE in this video breathe?

Legit, super sweet, though
I never let you go Jack
Camel snugs are the best snugs
I thought is was a giant frog mouth consuming him
Where do I line up for that?  
-- makes me realize I really could use a hug right now.
Kinda hug I need rn❤
TIL camels hug like geese
I too want a camel hug.
Am I seeing things is the handler holding a gun?
Are you shure that is a camel?
I never knew I wanted a camel neck hug until now D:
My neck hurts watch that
He taps that ass
Okay, this is cute, but I gotta say I'm weirdly creeped out. I had NO idea their necks were that flexible!!
Wholesome Camel Chokehold
I thought it was a huge mouth over the body. Then I put my glasses on
I thought the Arabian man was getting swallowed.
We don’t deserve animals they are so pure
I did not understand this picture.
It’s a big hug
I want a camel to hug me :(
Hairy snake with legs
Don’t know how I read camel EATING his herder
Didn’t realize how long their necks are without a human for scale. Things like an anaconda.
My dog and I need to step up our hug game.
Where’s Schnoodle at??
I never knew this about myself... but I NEED a camel best friend who gives me camel hugs. Oh, my heart!
I though the camel had a big ass mouth and was eating the guy
Everyone loved that.
This is love and respected for each other
Why does the thumbnail look like it's taking a giant bite of the guy?
The feel good video of the year.
Plot twist, it's trying to strangle him.
Cool
I can not be the only one who thought the guys being eaten
At first glance I thought this was some otherworldly creature devouring some poor guy. Turns out it was just a wholesome camel
Am I the only one who thinks it’s a dromedary?
I did not know how bad I wanted a hug from a camel until seeing this video!!
I legit thought the camel had the guys head in his mouth for a sec
At first glance I thought something with a huge head was swallowing him.
I didn't know their necks were that articulated.
awww
Camel hugs!
Ooohh i dident see the head and was like wtf
What tha fuck dude
That’s one thick scarf
It's because of the mutual respect they have for each other as low value males.
Plot twist, he's trying to suffocate him
I was scrolling by a *little* too quickly and exclaimed “OH MY GOD THAT CAMEL SWALLOWED A MAN” 

Never have I been happier to have been wrong
So precious
A solid few seconds went by with me thinking this was some kind of long-legged giant fuzzy big-lipped fish frog devouring a guy
I thought that was a big camel fish ('frog') that had a human in its mouth.
Wow, at a quick glance I thought the neck was a snake!  But how cute!  ☺️
🤣🤣🤣
Finally something wholesome this year..
As cute as this is the neck bending is fucking freaking me out
For a second there I thought the camel was pooping out the human
Camels, giraffes and elephants are so incredibly friendly and kind. I love them.
Love to human for animals...
That's called true love...
You know it's a real hug when you wrap necks as well.
Camels give the best neck
who knew camels had such long necks?
Sometimes I get really down on humanity and for good reason but things like this where two different species can embrace lovingly makes me happy, after all we turned wolves into mans best friend
I am not sure if it’s true or not but this was his comeback after the herder lost his son
It's like a very tall dog. With a longer neck.
CRUNCH
This is a dromedary.
Ain't that giraffe.
r/wholesomememes
Guess I’m getting a camel then
That's Beautiful :3.
aww
Reminds me of that scene from The boys
I didn’t know what it was at first

I thought some dudes head was consumed by a frog
Lol such strong hug
Great.  Another human adapted coronavirus moment.
Oh wow, I never realized camels can bend their necks like that! They look like good bros.
"Why cant i quit you"!!
You thought it was snek but it was camel all along hecking bamboozle
I wish someone hugged me like that lol
swan
I thought it was an animal eating someone’s head at first
I thought the camel had eaten the dude at first.
That is a dromedary
Aw, that's lovely. He must take good care of them.
Why the fuck did I feel like the camel opened his mouth and literally engulfed his head into a hug
Did read the title and thought it was some creature with a really large mouth eating someone.
Neck hug FTW!
I love camels so much, ngl. I got to ride one named Dean at my local zoo. Dean was an absolute gentleman and enjoyed pets. They’re softer than they look too, like lamb’s wool where they’re fluffy. 10/10, would suggest camel ride. They only spit/bite if you are not nice to the camel, so just listen to the handler on how to be friends with camel. They remember people really well and will hold grudges or be happy to see you. 

Anyway, I’m trying to talk my fiancé into at least alpacas. We have extra acres. Why not alpacas? He knows how to shear sheep already and they’re just extra long sheep. That or a llama because they’ll protect smaller livestock. Can’t ride either but you can pet their soft wool which is a big win.
Sweet
Looks like a snake with the body of a horse
Her* That camel is a she-camel
Arabic Nokia noise
It is 5 am and for a sec it looked like that camel was eating that man like a snake.  I was very confused.
Why do I have the urge to find a camel and receive a neck hug?
This is so beautiful!
whats wrong with that horses neck
For a second i thought this was a giant white frog eating a person alive, lol.
You get back whatever you give out! This is beautiful 😍
“Don’t ever leave me again 🥺” -cutie camel
Animals are much more deserving of respect and love than we as a species give them.
I watched this more than a couple minutes only to realize the gif being looping. Cuteee.
Bendy neck
MERS in 3.2.1...
Animals deserves LOVE too
What happens in the desert stays in the desert
Little known fact, much like boa constrictors camels squeeze their prey to suffocation before stretching their jaws wide enough to swallow the prey whole.
That’s one that I wouldn’t eat.
the neck rub...
I saw this a was real confused for a minute
What is it?
Camels are just land swans.
I thought he ate him
At first glance I thought it had his whole head in its mouth.... then I saw the neck wrapped around
At first glance, I thought he ate him.
I could watch that all night
At first i thought he was being swallowed by a giant mouth
Don’t ever leave me alone with Jim again .   He is a terrible herder.
When my dad was young, he went on a trip  in the desert and saw a camel. He had an apple on him so he decided to throw it. The camel thought it was a rock and came charging at him. Camels cant turn right or left when chasing someone if they do they fall, my dad knew that and narrowley  escaped the camel. My father told me that he saw the shadow of the camels neck reaching on him in the pure red sand. Camels are cute and cool but dont mess with them.
How am I supposed to eat camel meat after seeing this?
Awww very cute. Animals are so pure.
Long time wrestling fans will recognize this as the original camel clutch.
That’s incredible! I had no idea a camel’s neck could even do that. Never seen a camel show affection towards a human like this. However cameracrew overheard camel say to owner, “Don’t EVER fucking leave me, EVER again. These dudes wanted to run a train on me, had their phones out; where the fuck where you!?”
Such a beautiful moment.
I thought this was a huge mouth which swallowed his head at first... Kinda terrifying ngl
That’s so sweet
Watch out, they spit! 🐪🐫
Dude.. *back*
Duuuude!? *where have you been?*
...dude *Sorry*
...Dude... *Hugs*
Adorable!
I am cross posting this to r/SanderSides. Edit Patton would love it.
Adorable!!
It's very early for me and when I saw this, I thought the Camel was swallowing the herder whole
Wanna hump?
Anyone else think he was being eaten by something?
Thought I was looking at some kinda nose at first.
A head lock before the necking begins.
At first I thought the guy was being eaten, then I read the title
I didn’t know their neck was that bendy lol
Oh hes got him in a chokehold, 1.. 2 .. 3 ... ding ding ding
It looked like the front of the camel was a giant mouth and he was eating the man for a few seconds
Awww He loves his human 🥰
I didnt know camels were this ***fLexXible***
And camels were supposed to have salty attitudes...
I think that's a drama-dary.
I’m sorry but every time I look at this I always think it’s some giant toad trying to swallow the guy.
*dromedary

I have never seen a camel show affection like that! bravo
Bendy neck

For a second I thought it was some kind of mutant that was absorbing his head
When I first saw this I was trying to make sense out of it bc I just saw a dinosaur swallowing a guy whole
Neck said ↪️
the guy son died so the camel is hugging him ( confirmed )
Omg i didn't know they could bend their neck like that
The odds of getting choked out by a camel are low, but never zero.
You can just make a post title say anything. Doesn’t make it true. Regardless, I need a hug like that one day.
Is that dude holding a gun?
I love animals. Why are we killing everything. I am all good with food and sustainable meat but the primates and other species are dying fast.
https://youtu.be/lJNoAE0UHzY we had North American camels until extinction robbed us of them.
r/arabs
I genuinely thought some abomination of a creature with an enlarged mouth had swallowed the top half of a human. For a fraction of a second I thought “holy shit is this real?” 

It oddly looked familiar too. Not sure from what game but it’s a four legged creature with a roundish body and without a neck. Acted like a dog and may of had its tongue sticking out with slobber.
Yeah.. this looks cute... ha ha ha... when ramzan comes the same human will butcher the animal for food...
Is that real? That's absolutely beautiful - is it real though?
I like this a lot
I thought it was a beast eating the dudes head like "OMG GET HIM OUTTA THERE" then i was like "oh"
But that’s the back of the camel...
Damn camels are flexible
Is it just me or did It kinda looked like something was trying to swallow someone whole at first glance.
At first I thought the camel had the man's head in his mouth...duh
“He keeps me safe”
Alternative title: Camel strangles herder while coworker films.
Guy is gonna get MERS from this
Wholesome camel I could use I nice warm camel hug
Camelhug
Thank you; CAP\_X!
at first i thought the person was inside the camel's mouth
Wow, that sounds good
Never thought about a camels neck before. Long than I would expect.
Damn my wife doesn’t even like me that much and we usually get along.
Talk about white robed Prince problems am I right
That made my heart go Pitter Patter with Beautiful Red Hesrts flying towards those two!!
***Too cute!!***
Well I knew that they could be dangerous but I didn’t know that they were loving as well
a camel hoarder!!!
Wholesome
Did anyone else see the camel's legs and, at first glance, think it was the guy's bare legs and junk
Oh he a long neck boi
My high ass thought this dude was in the camels mouth
If someone says that this isn’t a sign of love and it’s like neck cancer or some shit I’m quitting life gen-z style and going offline for 5 mins
Omg that’s so sweet.
Damn I really want a hug off a animal
He brought a gun to meet his camel?
Camel: that’s my special boy.
I’m stoned and thought something was eating someone, until I saw the subreddit it was posted in, and then I was even more confused.
Camels like “Shit bro, cramp! I GOT A CRAMP! Help me stretch out!”
Camels are kinesthetic, they adore and communicate through touch, when they're treated right they are sweet as can be.
A sand swan hug
Animals are so compassionate
So wholesome

Now that’s a camel clutch
That’s incredibly sweet.

I know I saved her, but sometimes... I think she saved me
I love animals.
This is absolutely everything. My heart aches knowing I can’t get a camel hug
Oh I thought it had the guy in its mouth lol
i know what we’re all thinking. can the camel...
Til. Camels have bendy straws for necks.
Cool snek bro
Awwww !!! I want a camel hug
No greater bond than a man and his camel
Why is this making me cry
This looks exactly like that one pic of a swan hugging the person who raised it.
Love Transcends Species! This is the way, I have spoken!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I was looking through the comments and nobody mentioned it. That's actually not a camel it's a dromedary. The difference is the amount of humps on their backs. Camels have two of them.  Hope it the right word in English for that cute fella
From the thumbnail I thought it was some sorta weird giant camel head eating the man

[https://i.imgur.com/ayEW6Mq.png](https://i.imgur.com/ayEW6Mq.png)
Ohh how Sweet 😘 Pure Love 🥰
Tell my why at first glance I thought a man was being swallowed by a GIANT catfish???

Definitely been watching too much River Monsters😂
Did he walk a mile for that camel?
Met three camels in Dubai. Looked into my eyes like Golden Retrievers. Beautiful creatures.

There is a good penis meme here somewhere.
I thought it was a big frog eating a man tbh
That’s so adorable!
Herder: YOU’RE SQUEEZING ME TOO TIGHT

Camel: Sssshhhh
Rich Arab poor Camel , you get the picture.
they hug like llamas omg
Aw
Beautiful
And then the herder milks the camel.
fun fact: swans hug the same [exact way](https://www.holidogtimes.com/this-injured-swan-cant-stop-hugging-the-man-who-saved-her/)

Yeah. It's cool and all but look at the camel toes tho.
Thats a big samd dog
Great now i want a camel pet  🤦🏻‍♂️
He's choking!!!
Solid
Atleast he has a camel that hugs him
Is no one else a little horrified about how bendy that neck is?
For a second I thought his head was up the camel’s arsehole!
I literally first saw the camel swallowing the person whole....
holy shit for the first second i thought this thing had swallowed the guy in a giant mouth
Her* That’s a female camel
That’s a big snake
Ah the constrictor camel in its natural habitat, it has found a good meal today.
I didn't know the neck could bend like that
Am I just high (yes) or is that camel smiling
I love how love and hate are two emotions that transcends species
Wholesome
I never realized how long their necks are! Look at it wrapped around him like a damn scarf!
That’s love right their

Camels only want one thing and it's fucking disgusting

That's the same way swans hug
Ah yes. A generous hug from the noble humped back noodle neck horse.
For a moment I thought it was swallowing the person
adorable
I had never before realized how cute camels are. They have that same 'humans are my friends and I love them' quality about them as donkeys.
yeah camels are truly nice , but imo i think that camels dont have a middle feeling .

its either they love human so much or either they hate him so much , btw if u hurt camels then be sure to check ur doors , camels will never forget what u did to them either bad or good .

At first it looked like he was swallowing them
I thought that was a giant mutant frog-camel monster swallowing head of a person
Oh my goodness -- what a sweet hug!
And then they made sweet love
Get a room.
Can confirm , we give good hugs.
Look Ma! No hands!

Tina you fat lard I friggin love you
Wow whatever you do don't search "camel cute" on youtube. Wtf. After seeing this I wanted more cute videos of camels but now I'm sad.
This is why I don't eat animals
I want this for everyone
Damnit, now I want a camel
So camels aren't as ornery as they say.
Neck for days
Aw they hug like swans!
The only animal that can wrap around your neck during a hug. Looks absolutely adorable
❤️
For A second I thought the guy was in its mouth
That is beautiful.
This is both impressive *and* adorable.
So that's what the long neck is for...

He probably sold the camel after this.

Cutest camel  thing ive ever seen X3
Is this the new Camelconda movie ?
Wow!  Camels can be mean/nasty!  His human must have been very kind to him!
Now this is wholesome
How has no one said anything about the gun?
That camel has the neck of a dragon! #emotionalANIMALS
Their necks sure are bendy.

The only greeting I've gotten from a camel is a spit to the face.
Is this before or after he has sex with it?!

Hey you two, ... get a room
Good thing he didn’t go missing on HUMP DAY.. or else that greeting would’ve looked different..

Most animals are like how we expect dogs to be. Cows, sheep, goats and pigs too. Please consider going vegan or at least reduce your meat intake. Friends, not food ❤️
when the camel grew too old, will they slaughter it? 😢🥺
Probably gonna hump later.

They don't call em pack animals for nothing
Last hug, before she gets baked and served in a feast.
Just wait til later this evening
I thought Camels were generally very irritable animals?
