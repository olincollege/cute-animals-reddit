Aww...he's like that penguin that fell in love with the anime girl they put in his enclosure at the zoo. 
"By the way, you look unbelievably beautiful tonight.  You're practically glowing.  Maybe it's the light."
That‚Äôs the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all day 
Man, foxes are just so cute and fluffy 
Awww dude I love foxes, this is adorable. 
He‚Äôs sitting so pretty! Let him meet her and document the exchange. 
''twas a week before Christmas, n what did i see ?

the foxiest gal - she was Looking at Me!

her eyes - how they sparkled! they twinkled so merry

her whole body glowed like  a big Christmas cherry!

i sat on the porch, n we stared for awhile . . .

she never did move, 

but i did see a smile

i learned then that Christmas is not 'bout what's 'boxed' -

you can find it in ^small things, frens - don't be outfoxed ;)




decoration playing hard to get, zero fox given
I know they're wild animals but damn do I wish they were domesticated. 
Holy omg imagine their babies, imagine an avatar type fox that actually lights up all bioluminescencey.

This is the cutest thing.

Do you think your light up fox reminds him of a dream he once had?
Do you think the fox thinks that your light up fox is his God?

Omg I wish I had a house, and lights and a fox to play with. Although I would take any two of those things
[deleted]
Mfs just be out here with adorable foxes 
That‚Äôs a beautiful deck. Can I trade you? Like, I still want my house, but you can have my deck and I‚Äôll have yours. 
Fox- "babe you light up my life"
Mrs. Fox - "I'm pregnant"
 
Mr. Fox - *nervous smile* "Honey that's great news. You look like you're glowing"
The last pic says it all. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúHeyyyyy‚Äù.
Imagine being a fox, going through your yard, seeing a giant glowing effigy of yourself.
Maybe someone think you‚Äôre the one with the crush.
LADY IN REDDDDDDDDDDD ü•∞
I have a similar one but it's a cat and the first thing my real cat did was walk up and try to sniff its butt
The decorated fox could probably use some rest. He looks very light-headed.
*I* have a crush on your Christmas light decoration. Wherever did you get it?
This is a set up for a Pixar short if I‚Äôve ever seen one. 
THAT IS HECKING ADORABLE 
Filf 
You know you‚Äôre a cute little heart breaker. 
FOXY
He's using his tail as a pillow
Is this is the premise of the next Pixar movie. 

Fox falls in love with a Christmas decoration. Wishes it alive. They spend all Christmas together. On Christmas Day it turns back into a decoration. Fox is sad. Fox gets found by family who owned decoration. Fox is found to have a mental illness and is given meds by vet and the family decide to take him in, who already had a disabled lady fox that they rescued and was lonely.... happy ending. 
Very cute light up Fox decoration, where did you get it
How are people happy seeing this !? He's in love..but who he is in love with..won't ever love him back ! because it can't ! He's gonna be heartbroken :(
looks hungry, you should invite the little booger in
AWWWWWWWW
Love this! Foxes are underrated!
Man, foxes are adorable
Twas the night before christmas

When the fox went balls deep

Into my decoration

Of which I can no longer keep
Where did you purchase this?  
Where did you get the decoration? I love foxes so I must purchase this immediately

Foxes - Are they canines? Are they felines? I mean, yeah, I know they belong to the family Canidae, but who do they think they're fooling with their verticle-slit pupils and retractable claws?
I know there is almost no chance this gets answered, but where did you get that decoration? My wife LOVES foxes. We have little foxes all over the house. This would make her season if I could find this and get it for her. Thank you in advance! 
Oh my god, he's so beautiful!  Foxes are like cat-dogs.  They're perfect.
This is so stinkin cute and I am immensely jealous. I love little foxes so much. 
This would have made me ridiculously happy if it had happened to me, which I know considering how happy it's made me vicariously. 
Man this Disney movie looks like it's going to be great!
Is this like a fox's version of hentai?  Obviously fake, but strangely attractive...
That girl is lit
What does the fox say?
The head tilt in the last picture makes it for me.
Pixar, make a short outta this, ASAP!
Oh look at that curious little guy. I love foxes, it's like they can't decide if they wanna be a cat or a dog. 
This is heartbreaking but lovely. It reminds me of I Am Legend where he goes to the video store and just wants someone to talk to him.
This is bullshit. I have the same Christmas fox (got it at Target) and it has not yielded me any foxes yet. I am so disappointed.
Aw, he looks lonely!  üôÅ
It‚Äôs like in Fantastic Mr. Fox when his wife is literally glowing.
Okay, this is beautiful
What a little cutie patootie
Fox's are sooo pretty
Outfoxed. 
Fox would do this to my golden retriever . Also I‚Äôve caught one playing with a tennis ball in the snow . 
So sweet, nice job.  Merry Christmas!
He knows you‚Äôre fox-friendly
You light up my life
How dangerous are foxes really? They look so pettable lol
/r/foxes deserves this 
What does the fox say?
Can't you SEE he's the fox?

Let me hear you applaud!

He is MORE than a fox!

HE'S A SHINY GOLDEN GOD!!!
That's one healthy looking fox.
My mom has a light up tinsel pig with the same hat and scarf as yours! I didn‚Äôt know there were more tinsel animals! Does yours have a name? She named it Hamlet. 
This is fucking adorable.
I‚Äôve never seen a fox before. They always look so curious in pictures 
Now r/awwtf in the next photo shoot. 
Aw, distant, unreachable love. 
Babymetal becomes real.
Brb. My heart is exploding üòç

And I have a crush on that fox, it's so cute!
u/AoMCrapulence
Foxes are adorable, but I'm seeing a *lot* of misinformation about "domestic foxes" on this thread. Here's the truth:

* There is no such thing as a totally "tame" fox, assuming that your idea of "tame" is an animal which will happily live in your house and actively seek your companionship. [**Even the famous "Russian Domestic Foxes" are not completely domesticated**](http://theartfulfox.tumblr.com/post/61131776543/russian-domesticated-foxes-myths-uncovered) and retain a lot of wild traits (skunky odor, yowling, a need to burrow, peeing/pooping everywhere) which make them completely inappropriate as traditional "pets."

> No fox ‚Äì be they domestic, captive bred or wild, is a dog. They do not act like dogs. They are not dogs. No one should ever buy any fox expecting it to act like a dog. They still smell like skunk, are incredibly loud, require extensive socialization, experience the ‚ÄúOctober Crazies‚Äù, are destructive when bored, mark their territory with urine and feces and call during the mating season.

This is true even if the fox is neutered or spayed.


* With a few *rare* exceptions, **adult foxes, even if raised by humans, are not "cuddly" animals and don't typically like being petted.** Those photos and videos you see on Instagram and r/aww are the *exception* and not the rule.

* **Being raised by humans does not cause a fox, or any other wild animal, to become "tame" or "domesticated."** What it does is create a confused, *imprinted* wild animal which thinks that the human caretaker is its mother. Since foxes don't maintain a bond with their mothers after reaching adulthood (and will actually challenge her for territory) this is no guarantee of a friendly relationship. If a fox *does* bond with a person, it will typically only be towards *that one person*, and the fox may become aggressive towards anyone else. 

* **All foxes, regardless of origin, have a persistent "skunky" odor.** Unlike a skunk, their scent glands cannot be surgically removed.

* **Foxes cannot be trained as easily as dogs, and generally cannot be "potty trained" at all.** They *will* pee and poop all over everything they see as "theirs" (i.e. you and your possessions) and fox urine smells like the worst skunk you've ever smelled.

* **Any fox kept in a home 24/7 will quickly become miserable and destructive.** They require a zoo-quality outdoor enclosure, and that's expensive.

* US laws generally treat *all* foxes, captive-bred, "domesticated," etc. as wildlife. **It's illegal to own any fox in most US jurisdictions without a permit. Even if your state allows it, your county or city may not.**

* Because foxes are considered rabies vector species in the US and there has been no vaccine confirmed effective in them, **any pet fox which bites someone, or that is *alleged* to have bitten someone, will, by law, be confiscated and euthanized in order to test for rabies.** Even the tamest foxes *will* bite, so this is a very real danger.

*Above all, please remember that the photos and videos of "pet" foxes acting tame and cuddly are the exception and not the rule.* For every "tame" pet fox you see on reddit or Instagram, countless foxes are surrendered to sanctuaries or euthanized after people discovered that the reality of owning a fox is not the fairytale that social media often portrays. That's why I feel the need to debunk these myths every time they come up. I hate being a Debbie Downer, 

"you're glowing"
To be fair, it is a very lovely decoration.
Careful, he may just want your wallet.

Oh my love you are shining tonight 
‚ÄúSup, Sis?  You lookin‚Äô lit af!‚Äù

Now he'll bring his unrealistic high standard for female foxes back to his den and thus the fox species died out.

Humans have it easy - there are dating options everywhere. There are literally people EVERYWHERE you look that are worthy of dating. I can't imagine how lonely it must be to be a fox in the wild, where you only see another fox every few days or even very few weeks, and your mating and companionship options are so few and far between.
He's found his Evangeline.
Awww he is such a good boy....
In the bottom right picture, he looks like Todd from a scene in The Fox and The Hound.
im the real fox falling in love with a fake fox, that's life little foxy, you gotta learn.
Well don't just stand there...
This is adorable. I wonder what the Fox is thinking. 
That‚Äôs really cute.

‚ÄúLooking quite.. foxy‚Äù

Ohh, the interest the flufftail is showing for that light-on foxy.

He's probably wondering if she's available Friday night to go out for a drink and a mousey snak.
"Santa Fox? Is that... is that you?!"  *Prostrates self*  "I am not worthy!  But uh... bring me chickens?"
Mirin'
Are you sure the fox sees another fox and not a chicken?
Omg she or he is such a beauty! Look at those curious ears, tilted head and fur color on the pawies is sooo adorable! And that tail is fluffy as fuck! Awww i cant even
But... What does it *say*?!

Spoil time.

He was attracted by the scent of food. Noticed there is no snow on the wood. Wood is an insulator, so he stuck around to enjoy the heat radiating from the light fixtures. He has no concept that this arrangement of lights is supposed to represent a fox.
