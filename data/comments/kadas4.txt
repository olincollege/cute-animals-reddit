He wanted belly rubs. Why didn‚Äôt he give him belly rubs üòî
Pet the cat
She lies down and the guy is like "good god you're a fucking genius" and follows suit
On the catwalk, yeah on the catwalk. I shake my little tail on the catwalk.
Unbelievable how the hooman tried to take cat's spotlight.
She's a cat in Egypt. Worship is her ancestral birthright.
"Why is that guy stealing my thunder?!" - Kitty, probably
Cats are everywhere in Egypt. People feed them and play with them and the cats walk in and out of shops and restaurants all the time and everyone just acts like it‚Äôs normal, I guess because it is normal. 

*this is a memory from when I went ten years ago, I was 10-11*
Do egyptians still love cats like back in ancient egypt?
finally getting some of the recognition i deserve - cat
And the winner of all awards today goes tooooooo......   Kitty!
everybody wants a picture with the cat
I lived in Cairo for my sophomore year in high school.  One of the memories that stands out is watching the Royal Shakespeare Company performing Macbeth, which we watched on a school field trip.  During a particularly intense scene, a mother cat and her kittens proceeded to run up on the stage and frolic for several minutes.  The actors took it in stride and it got a few good laughs.  Cats are everywhere in Cairo.
This guy has more personality than 90% of the Hollywood actors
I hope he took that kitten home! It get so excited with those wavy arms.
Pet the god damn cat.
"No hooman, you do preening all wrong! Do this! Yes, now this! Preen more! Now pet me you dunce."

That man really said ‚Äúok how can I get the attention back on me?‚Äù
Can someone confirm that this cat got pets?
kitten says: bitch please... my ancestors were worshipped as gods.
He stole the show. This reminds me of the cat who came on stage during an orchestra performance.
C'mon kitty, do kitty yoga and lick your butt. Let's see Hawt Guy copy cat that... please.
That dude looks so much like Angry Joe. Down to the leather jacket, the hair, raised eyebrow, and the facial hair. Weird.
Pet the cat you monsters
Pet it you fools!
When this clip is reposted over the years hopefully people right away will be like "oh yeah, that must be 2020/2021".  I thought it was an old clip because of the quality until I noticed the masks.
Pet the kitty damnit. It‚Äôs obviously really wanting some pets.
 I think you are mistaken, the red carpet was for the special guest the cat
The dude just matching the cat's poses killed me. That was fuckin great!
So I guess I was the only one yelling ‚ÄúPet the kitty‚Äôs belly!‚Äù
"Once we were gods."

The human is handling it magnificently!
Here is a bit more about the kitty [https://www.arabnews.com/node/1773291/offbeat](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1773291/offbeat)
How‚Äôs he just gonna ignore that belly?
Worship me human, like thy ancestors have done
I love how the guy takes queues from the cat for his poses
Good for him for going along with it and letting the kitty pick the poses hahaha
Awww lil bb just wants to be worshiped again.

That kitty wants to become famous üò∫
I like how the woman just took cat pics and literally gave 0 fks about the guy "hello darkness my old friend"
The cat's like 'just stroke me you self centered prick!'
Something about a human adult begging for attention is way less appealing than a cat begging for attention
ŒóŒøw adorable
Stop posing and pet the cat!!!!
Does modern Egyptian culture have a similiar deference towards cats the ancient Egyptian society did?
PET HIS BELLY OMG

I don‚Äôt know celebrities at all, but just the way this dude adapted and posed with the cat shows some great charisma and I hope he got many awards and all the movie roles in future, the cat too.
That best picture was the bomb
Improvise, adapt, overcome
This is exactly what fashion photographers want
Why does a kitten get to do this and it's not a problem but when i do it,  I get arrested. The cat was naked too.....
That man has some serious self control. I would just be petting the cat. Totally distracted.
I recognize the cat, but who‚Äôs the dude?
All praise the kitties!!!

Let the cat do it's thing, we don't need you on there with it. It doesn't need you moron.

On the catwalk I do my little turns on the catwalk
Cat: Get out of my photos human
I WANT TO AWARD THIS KITTEN BUT I‚ÄôM POOR!!!
Is this dude posing ironically or unironically? Because i can see myself doing that ironically at some wedding
This dude models. Quick readjustments at different angles for poses, all improvised to the cat's poses and positions. Pretty cool.
Does their culture still think highly of cats. Not like some divine animal. Did the culture still keep a little kitten love.
Cat didnt even know what was going on
Oh that‚Äôs just Bast.
This guy is not aware that they are photographing the cat, not him :D
When did Borat get the cat?

Just proving that Egyptians and their worshipping of cats never goes out of style.
I love that the cat was posing too and started to change positions as the man did.   Precious.
That cat deserves more fame than the kadashians
this project requires IMMEDIATE funding
Correction: humans are crashing a kitten's film festival.

I didn't know Angry Joe was that popular.
Someone give this cat a home!
Which one is the kitten?

Dude, stop stealing my thunder. Theyre here for me not for your dumb ass.

- The cat probably.
hahaahah he is totally hamming it up with that baby!
It's Egypt.  that cat's distant ancestors were worshiped as gods.   No wonder it's all like "Gimme that platform to stand on".

"What is this dumb human doing, this is my kingdom..."

Whos this dude? I like him already
At least pet the damn cat if you're going to post it all over your social media.
The cat just wants its belly scratched
She knows she is everything
I‚Äôd skip the screening to hang out with the kitty
Guaranteed that cat got adopted and now he probably has a diamond studded collar and is living life to the fullest

Angry joe!
That's a nice kitty right there.

I love how color coordinated this guy and his outfit are with the cat. It's pleasing on a very visceral level.
Hats off to dude for just running with it like a pro.
Egypt still loves cats.
Is that Rahul?
In my next life, I'm going to be a cat. They are all fully employed, even during the pandemic.
It would be a calico cat
This is definitely a dumb question, but I know in ancient Egypt cats were revered. Are cats still considered special today?
Model cat
That‚Äôs so cute! When the cat payed down its almost as if s/he was posing! üòÇ
Who's the asshole behind him? Why didn't the cat push him off the little stage thing?
Would have loved it if the cat decided to lick it‚Äôs own butt
This is an enlightened gentleman, seeking to understand the ways of the great felines and integrate amongst them.
I don't know who the guy is (I'm assuming an Egyptian film star?) but I officially love him. I hope he took the kitten home.
This deserves to be the most liked post on reddit.
Kitty cat be *rocking it* too like there be poses *struck* in this vid by human and feline and I'm here for it
You know in books, anime and movies there's a scene like this were there's a monster disguised as a human right and a random character tries to expose said monster by scaring it or making it expose it true self e.i eating the cat. Just putting this out there cuz I have an overactive imagination

cat on cairo film festivel
Egypt has a huge feral cat population. Unfortunately they don't have a lot of good folks trying to care for them. And like in every country on this old globe, there are inconsiderate poop-for-brains that just abandon their animals for whatever inconsiderate poop-for-brains reason they can manage to come up with. 
Kind of makes you lose faith in humans...providing you had some to start with.

Cats are intelligent animals with strong emotions. You can find her home even if you are several kilometers away. It is known among people as being ungrateful, while dogs are known to be loyal, but those who know accept cats and prefer them, because they do not beg to anyone, and they realize that the provision is from God only, while they do not accept dogs because they exaggerate adulation to their owner, whatever. In Islam, the urine of a kitten does not defile clothes, while a dog's saliva, in addition to his urine, is considered unclean. In the Shafi‚Äôi school, the plate that the dog‚Äôs saliva touched must be washed seven times, once with soil. It is also forbidden to keep dogs at home except for the purposes of hunting and guarding.
