I have trained my kitten to give "kisses" when I get home, by booping the tip of my nose against his everytime. This has resulted in him shoving his entire nose into my nostril when he wants to wake me up.
I love how you can see her visibly relax after the stretch, like *ooh* that was a good one
So cats like squishing AND stretching. They seem to have many things in common with bread dough

If one of them isn't saying "soo big!" when this happens it would be a crying shame.
My senior guy insists on the same thing before picking him up.  If you don't, I suspect it hurts him a little bit and he meows harshly....if you're gonna pick him up, gotta stretch like this for a few seconds first.
She's praising the sun
‚ÄúAlright I gave you the stretch now where is my treat?‚Äù
Helping her be the best that she can be :)
*Dear diary,* 

*Today I saw a viking stretching a cat.*
This is so wholesome!
My man looks like fred if scooby doo was about mystery solving vikings

Edit: just thought if there's a talented artist that wants to draw the gang as vikings I would greatly appreciate it
He‚Äôs like a Catropractor!!
Then is owners turn
I thought you were Fred from Scooby Doo
I demand a Dark Souls outfit for the kitty. Purrraaiise the Sun!
We laugh, but this looks like such a wonderful thing for the back. My jenky back is jealous.
So to respond to a few things I‚Äôm seeing in the comments:

- The blue ‚Äúscarf‚Äù you‚Äôre seeing on my boyfriend isn‚Äôt a scarf, it‚Äôs a face mask that wraps all the way around your head, he just had it on his neck because he was home on his lunch break and gave her the stretch before leaving to go back! He does kind of look like a hipster Fred with it like that around his neck, though, lol.
- I see some people don‚Äôt like his hair, but that‚Äôs okay, I do and he does and that‚Äôs all that matters!
- This habit came about because ever since Daisy was a kitten, she‚Äôd lift her arms to the sky any time someone picked her up. My boyfriend decided he‚Äôd help stretch her out when she lifts her arms and now she just expects it any time he gets back home! 
- Daisy enjoys the stretches. Boyfriend isn‚Äôt rough with her and doesn‚Äôt hurt her doing this! She grunts a little after every stretch like we humans do after a good stretch, and her little paws shake during because she loves it. 

If I missed anything or you have another question, just reply here! My notifications and messages are a bit crazy right now so apologies for not replying to people individually!
Praise the sun!
My husband stretches our cats like this, but he holds them facing away from him with their back against his torso and leans back a bit. Our cats are chonks and always give these big shuddering stretches lol
Find you somebody who loves you like Daisy loves OP's boyfriend!

I love seeing these posts. I have a crush on your cat's crush :)
What a docile cat. If I tried that with mine I'd be scratched to shreds.
Praise the sun
Her tummy looks like she's wearing a v-necked argyle sweater. Her coloring shows a v at the neck with sort of diamond-shaped patterns of color. I've never seen a cat stretch like that except when laying on its side. She's very limber and must care for you and your boyfriend a lot.
Praise the Sun!!
"You think one of these days he'll finally let me hug him?"
My cat patches uses to love stretches.
One of our cats loves to be stretched like this too! You can feel all of his muscles trembling and stretching and you can tell how satisfying it is for him.

Aawww... What a cute video!! :). Happy cake day, by the way!! :)
Oooooh big stretch!

The cats stretching like the fabric on that baby gap t shirt.
People can choose their dogs, but cats choose their people. If this is how Daisy greets your boyfriend, then she has chosen him to be her person.
Praise the sun!
We have a cat who does the same.  His name is.... Stretch.
This video would also work with the title "Man bends cats for fun".
She has some cute armpits. **A sentence I never thought I would write (or say)

What a haircut.
That looks like a pretty damn good stretch worth the wait.
Fred seems different after parting ways with the mystery gang.

You two are just gonna have to get married now. The cat's too attached for him to suddenly dissappear.

Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.
Jeez, your boyfriend could stretch me out, too
Daisy is such a pretty kitty! She looks she has a V-neck on when she is stretched out. <3
You should buy him some tshirts that are his size.
This is adorable
Ooohhh big stretch!!!
Now that's love.
I used to do that with my Ninja! <3

Oh my gosh!! My kitty does this EXACT same thing!! I‚Äôve never seen another cat do it, my other kitty hates it. Cutest thing ever!!
r/touchdownkitty
Cute cat and cool coloring! Never seen calico this black! (Not to be confused with torties, which usually are dark.)
This is so cute. I love how calicos can have such different black:red:white ratios in their fur. I have 3 calicos and they look so different. Anyway, Daisy is a doll! Sweet boyfriend, sweet cat. I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre doing all right.
Gimnastik kat))))))
My smaller of two cats loves this too! It makes me really happy when she wants me to do it because I can feel and see her relief and happiness.
This is really cute. Also happy cake day!

This is not a stretch, this is a saiyan attempting to collect energy from around the earth to produce a spirit bomb
This is a fun thread but ignores the fact that the cat stretching and flinging her front legs up is adorable!
What a unique pattern for a calico!

Awww my very first kitty did this. He would stretch way out and hug me around the neck every day after work.  It was the best. Thanks for the reminder!
This is absolutely precious ü•∫
When my dog was a puppy he'd bark at us when we sneezed.  Once when my daughter sneezed, in the brief second she had her eyes closed, he had traveled 10 feet to stick his snout in her open mouth.  LOL
Ugh my dumb idiot heart
Stop it right now
This is one of those gifs that I've got to pay attention to the time on or I'll just watch it on a loop for like an absurd amount of time. It's very satisfying.
Can someone turn this off before I hurt myself watching this cuteness?!
Me stretching after doing 2 minutes of tower
My cat is pisses at me now. He didn't want to stretch.
Marry that man
He can give me one too! Woof!

Aww! So precious! I've gotta try with my cat
This is so cute, oh my god! Daisy is such a cute name for a pied tortie too!  Daisy looks like my cat Freya-Bean\^\^
You mean Daisy's boyfriend waits for him to give her a stretch. And then she let's you guys hang out.
Daisy was my cats name also... She was a black cat with spots of white under her neck.... Miss my Daisy Girl.... And stretch kitty stretch...
Your BF seems like a gentle giant.

Too adorable. Didn‚Äôt even know this was possible
Hug the damn cat!
Our ginger tabby Gabriel used to do this... haven‚Äôt had a cat since that did. I‚Äôm hopeful though!
My parents do the same with their cats, although one prefers to be "stretched" on the ground. Amaze
How does one even know a cat wants this the first time?

Omg! My cat does this too. If you pick her up off the ground, she stretches her back legs too.
OK, now, everyone. Take a big inhale? And then on the exhale... Shift into salutation to the sun.
That's a cool cat
Question is does he do the same with you??
Old bjorn Ironsides
Praise the sun \o/
This is adorable. Also, you should talk him into adding hammer curls into his workouts as it will give his biceps more definition and size ( I had that same issue for such a long time and it was such a simple solution).
I legit thought this was someone I knew for a minute
THAT IS ADORABLE OH MY GOSH
My cat would claw my eye out if I tried this
what a sweet girl ‚ù§Ô∏è
My cats suck. Apparently
That is a adorable. I love when pets and owners have their little rituals. When I'd come home from school I'd shower then sit on the couch. My dog would then come over and sit down by legs waiting for me to run my clean feet along her belly.
GENKI DAMAAAAA
Praise the Sun!
That's adorable!
Even though I'm not a cat person, this is so adorable and funny. :3
Your bf is a MMA fighter?
Praise the Sun!
Yes, this is what I needed.
My cat does this, but we call it ‚ÄúLoooooong Kitty‚Äù lol. Which is cute until you‚Äôre at the vet and they ask you to raise her front legs up to access the belly and you say ‚Äúloooooong kitty!‚Äù Like a weirdo in front of the vet.
My hooman helps me exercise and after a days cat napping,I need a good stretch....
Yogatta do what yogatta do
The cat is great, but can we all pay attention to how the boyfriend is dressed like hipster Fred from Scooby Doo when he's wearing that white polo?
Cats are the best
My cat does the same when you touch near his armpits, so cute
So sweet! How did they develop such a routine?
When the bass drops
I'd love to see this video with the human edited out. Nothing against him I just think it would look hilarious
Daisy says, "Marry that man!"
How adorable,! Who else could use some of that right about now?
Ready? Begin. Down... up.
I have no idea how long I've been watching this for ü§î
So graceful
How can you not add a kiss to that belly!!
Cat is a big Shawshank Redemption fan.
Ohh that‚Äôs a big stretch
My animals love stretching!
Awwwww!!!!!
PRAISE THE SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNN!!!!
My cat does the same thing! He stretches his paw out too and wants to me to pick him up during the stretch process.
A lot of people are allergic to cats
PRECIOUS FLOWER üò≠üò≠
When did fred from scooby doo get so swoll
My boyfriend does this to my kitty too!! Well I do give my kitty stretches a lot too.
Looks like Fred from Scooby Doo at the start
Buddy, one day you‚Äôre gonna stretch it too far, and that‚Äôs gonna be a sad one.
I do exactly that with one of my cats! He loves it. My other cat is not flexible at all haha.
I had a cat that would kind of do this, except she put her paws on my shoulders so we called it a hug. She was probably just stretching though.
I sincerely have never seen anyone do that outside of myself... Great minds and birds of feather
Anyone else make stretching noises while watching this?
That was one of the cutest things I‚Äôve ever seen. It makes me think of [this stretch. ](https://tenor.com/view/lift-cat-human-cute-hug-gif-3539698)
I used to do that my black cat when she was still alive. She loved it too.
There is an innuendo in this..
Gorgeous lil tortie!
OMG!  I was just watching videos of a cat doing this.  OMG IT'S A THING THIS MAKES ME HAPPY!
Aww, big stretch
I have a two brothers that do this. One does it to be thrown over my shoulder and the other just does it for my attention. It‚Äôs the cutest feeling.
She's praising the sun.
He's a Catropractor?
My cat does this too! You can feel all his muscles shake it feels like it would be glorious

I watched this for a very long time before realising it was a loop.

You know that stretch you do in the morning and it feels really really really good? I bet that's what the cat feels like each time she does that stretch.
Big stretches!! She‚Äôs so cute. And happy cake

That was awfully nice of Daisy to choose your life partner for you.
Can you imagine, even to lazy to stretch on it's own

Oh damn... can I get a stretch too? That looks so good it made my body ache.
I do this with my shepherd every morning and when I come home, he loves it.
Oh my goodness my cat does that when I go to pick him up
Must be accompanied by saying "oh big stretch"
Cutest thing I've watched today. God, I need to stretch too, then I'll feel better.
That is a beautiful cat!!
Looks like they‚Äôre praying together lol
Back trouble in cats!  Of course!  A good stretch is chiropractically recommended.
Ohh, that made me want to stretch too
My kitty does this, but only the opposite way! She loves to stretch legs as well!
She trained him well!
Yay team!
Daisy:" Human's home, I think i'll give him the pleasure to hold me again today."
My cat demands a nelly scratch the moment I walk in the door after work. Amazing how well they‚Äôve trained us!

Duuuudee I do the same thing to my cats in the morning and whenever I see them wakeing up. Really cool to see their claws come out before retracting when the relax again. They love it!
This is too sweet. <3
Happy cake day
my cat does this when I pick him up! 

he'll be on his back and do a full stretch toes and all
My husband does this with our cat!
Ha that‚Äôs great. Our cat hates when my wife picks him up unless it‚Äôs to help him stretch and he looks so much like that
u/savevideo
That‚Äôs a back adjustment not a stretch!
Praise!
Yea but what does your boyfriend give to Daisy every time Daisy gets home?
Stretchy boy
By the caption alone I thought this was going to go a different direction.
Can't tell if she just expects it and tolerates it or if she actually wants it.
Yoga Cat
Do you even praise the sun bro?
My cat Enzo loves to be stretched just like Daisy!  He‚Äôll actually stand up and put his front paws up in preparation.
‚ÄúPraise tha lord!‚Äù

You want a hug? Psyyyyyyyych!

Hehe my cat does this too :3
I love the idea that Daisy actually hates this but thinks the boyfriend loves it and does it out of a sense of duty.
My kitty‚Äôs also named Daisy.
What a great stretch. I could just see how good it felt.  ü§ó
I forget why I like reddit until I see things like this
When I met my now-wife, she had a black cat that loved to do this whenever she came home from work.

If he had a good one, he would even make a satisfied grunt. It was very cute.
Biiig stretch.
Is he a chiropractor?
we do this too! big stretch gang. she trembles and stretches her beans mid stretch, too. that‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs good.
I have found cats are 100% creatures of habit. Once they like something and get used to it, , they must have it in their routine... or you'll hear about it
Nice ponytail cupcake
Kitty chiropractor!
Is it weird that I want to be Daisy and have someone stretch me?

Cats can be so quirky. One of mine used to stretch her back legs so often it was compulsive.
The cat is actually instructing him on how to pray to her properly
Is your boyfriend Fred? From the mystery machine?
So he's a cat chiropractor... Nice
I used to stretch my cat like this too. When you lift the arms above the head, the shoulders vibrate a bit, and if you lengthen out the legs, the thighs shake a little bit.  Only works on relaxed cats.
Happy cake day!
Oh how I wish I could be so grossly incandescent

WTF, I also have a stretchy cat!
I enjoy this, my favorite cat move is measuring them. One hand under front legs one hand under back then stretching them out parallel to you with arms extended. Unless completely farell I've never met a cat who doesn't enjoy being measured
Love
Omg my cat does this exact thing! I thought she was the only one!
She has ginger pits!
I do this to my cat too! hahaha They love this
I‚Äôm stressed at work, watching this made me do a stretch as well and felt my bones pop with such relief! Thanks!

My cat, Mr. Biscuits likes his tail pulled aggressively and prefers an audience when he licks his butthole, especially with eye contact.
He‚Äôs a big boy and the cat is very cute.

I do this with my cat Max, but I flip him around the other way and lean back myself so we stretch together.
