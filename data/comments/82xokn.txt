*coming into this thread* "Haha what a cute dog, jumping into her arms like that!"

*leaving this thread* "Humanity is a blight upon this Earth, and hell awaits the ignorant masses..."
Super cute until I saw the other dog in the bottom left corner. I'd feel guilty and have to buy both. That's why I avoid pet stores
This is the trust of a dog that has never been dropped. 
When you see how big the box it lives in is it's not a surprise how eager it is to leave. Tactics perhaps?
Doggie has a good sales tactic 😂
Hate these puppy stores. Countless pups come into my hospital, sick and malnourished. Adopt, don't buy.  Then hopefully, these stores will go out of business. 
Don’t buy from stores and support the assholes who owns them. Adopt from a local shelter.
As adorable as it sounds, it’s sad to see the conditions that puppies have the live in for both pet stores and mills. I wish there was something we could do about it
:(
The worst & most disgusting place to buy a dog or cat from.
[deleted]
More like save me. Those puppy mill pet stores are horrendous. 
Don't support pet stores like these, they most likely come from puppy mills where they are raised in horrific and cruel conditions.
God I hate stores like these. Poor dogs.
I just imagine cartoon jump sounds. *sproink*
More like "Rescue me! I was raised in a puppy mill and now live in a glass box."
Poor little puppy mill puppy. They are all good dogs worthy of loving homes, but when you buy from pet stores (that aren't adoption centers) you're fueling the horrific torturous conditions these dogs endure (both the parents and the puppies that are never sold) and the cycle continues. 

Adopt, save a life.

In videos like this, all I see is a dog being trained to jump out of it's dangerously elevated cage...

I know, I'm ruining the cute, but what if someone else shows up and isn't ready to catch a flying fluff?
Pup at the left corner so sad tho.
Dog comes fully equipped with total faith in new owner.
Please don't buy animals from a pet store, especially dogs. I hate puppy mills. Ours is a rescue from one. She saw nothing but a small cage for her first 2 years of life. 
#**NEVER!** 
Never buy a dog from these places. 

As a kid, I fell in love with a dog in a pet store like this. I was able to convince my parents to get it for me. It was a loving dog, but it spent so much time in that cage that it became neurotic.

It refused to go to the bathroom if you are watching it. However, it had no problems going to the bathroom in its crate the *instant* you left the house.  For years, we would almost cringe at the idea of coming home, because we knew we had to wash our brown dog that should have been white.  What's worse is it constantly licked itself raw until it got open sores.

We had no idea how terrible puppy mills were.  After doing research, we were astonished by how badly these animals are treated.  

My next puppy was a mutt from the neighbors dog, and it turned out to be the best dog you could ever ask for.  I'll only have a mutt from here on out.
As a serious point, where this is in the world has a big impact on whether or not it is appropriate/possible to adopt, and therefore if purchasing is the only sensible way to get a job barring bringing one home from abroad. 

In Japan for instance I know that adopting a cat or dog is next to impossible because there are almost no animal shelters, and the few there are might as well have waiting lists because they don't have a constant flow of animals needing homes. This doesn't mean there aren't a large serious issues with animal abuse over there, or that the shops and breeders don't have bad practices, simply that the problems they face are different.

Thought I'd just point that out.
Do not even walk into stores that sell puppies! 
I like how everyone in this sub always say "adopt, don't shop" but it's always the purebred dogs that get upvoted to the front page 
This doesn’t seem like a great place for a pet to be in :( personally I’m not a fan of stores the sell pets. 
Puppy farms are not cute. It's a horrible system for every animal involved.
Do not buy from puppymills!
Cute. I hope that girl adopted him 
how the f are places like these still around?
*get me out of this breeding hellhole plz*
Puppies aren't products. Adopt don't shop. Don't breed and buy while shelter dogs die.
My 1st grade, best friend's parents were cocker spaniel breeders and looking back (didn't know any better at the time) their conditions were horrific.  Their voice boxes had been surgically removed and they were kept in 3ft x 5ft cages their entire life (never taken out except to breed). ADOPT DON'T BUY!
Please don't buy puppy mill dogs. Please don't even go into or support these horrible stores. 

Any store that sells puppies is supplied by a puppy mill. Those cute puppies come from adult dogs that are suffering in horrific ways. 

No reputable breeder would ever sell thier puppies this way- you are, without a doubt buying a dog with a very questionable background, I've seen hundreds if not thousands of cases that led to heartbreaking wallet-breaking illnesses because of the genetic messes that come from puppy mills,and the parent dogs are kept in tiny filthy cages and bred until they drop dead.

They lie about the puppies parentage, the condition of the breeders, the health and well-being of the dogs. The petstores at our local mall got 2-5 dead puppies with every batch,others died in route from easily treatable parasites, others from parvo, and those that survive and get sold... Look up the worst genetic health problems of the breed and just assume that's what youll be paying for. 

 Many of the puppy mill rescues I've helped with have hundreds of dogs 6-10 years old that have never seen or touched grass or been touched by humans. The puppies may be cute but the only way to end this hellish torture is to stop giving them your business and your money. 

Shop anywhere else. Anywhere that doesn't sell animals. PLEASE. 
Me at job interviews.
That's more sad than anything else.
I see a lot of 'don't buy from pet store' comments here and that makes me happy because mills in the US suck, but I'm pretty sure this .gif is from somewhere in Japan. I'm not really sure how pet store sales work in Japan and where the dogs come from, but I just wanted to throw that out there.
I genuinely thought these puppy mill stores were ruled illegal some 15 years ago. What the hell? I didn't know they still were a thing and now I'm all pissed off. 
makes me sad
This makes me feel very sad
Please don’t buy a dog from a pet store; they’re almost always from puppy mills and they’re often defective from generations of inbreeding or just plain sickly. I agree with the other folks who say go to an animal shelter, *unless* you have a specific purpose in mind for the dog (bird dog, K-9, Search and Resue, herding, etc.), in which case you need to do a lot of research to find a reputable breeder before buying.
I hate pushy sales people.
"They're just jumping off the shelf."
its sad 
I would hold on and never let go
Not going to read any of this thread, just going to say that this makes me morbidly sad 😢 
Can I be sad and aww'ed at the same Time? How about awwade? 
Man my own Pomeranian that I've had for years doesn't even trust me this much
Sad really
That floof in the bottom cage ;-;
Either this or this puppy is repeatedly trying to end its life BECAUSE ITS BEING HELD PRISON AT A PET STORE, but this annoying human keeps thwarting its attempts! 
Leap of faith
I wish I could trust a partner as much as this lovely doggo trusts strangers.
No way I'd be leaving without that dog. No way.
Ya that dog would be coming home with me 
Still confused how there are pet stores that sell dogs and cats. Like what the fuck. That shit's so illegal here. 
Where is this place where dogs are still kept like this?
Wow, you mean that dog doesn’t want to live in a small display case?
How are Dogs and Cats being sold in pet stores still a thing? I don’t see a cute Dog, I see many poor Dog’s that are being made a forced problem. 
As a dutch person, this is so foreign to me and so sad to see dogs being sold in a petstore.
This makes me so sad :(   Poor little pooch just wants out of that box
I hate these places but still that dog is just adorable
Poor dog 
One of my most harcore rescue gals bought aa puppy from a pet store in the mall. An australian cattledog puppy. The puppy had been in that glass box for 9 months. A cattledog. She had to get a really shitty loan to get that puppy out of that box. I totally get it. 
Adopt more and buy less
So torn because right now we're looking at dogs to adopt from rescue shelters in Illinois. We're surrounded by so many pet stores like Petland that have the most adorable looking puppies, but all of their reviews talk about how the puppies cost between $1k - $4k and after they've bought the pup they take it to the vet only to find out it has so many health issues. It's hard to turn down their adorable faces but it's also important to remember not to support the puppy mills that have such horrible environments that create puppies with health issues. We're restricting ourselves to rescues only. Hopefully we'll find a good pup this weekend!
If I spent who knows how long trapped in a tiny glass box, I'd jump into the arms of the first person who opened it too.
I bought two Yorkies, who I love to bits, until I discovered the joys of rescues.  I’ve now got 4 more dogs, all failed fosters.  They are wonderful and have so much love to give.
You mean adopt... you can't buy family members.
Those dogs live in boxes...? 

Fuck puppy mills and all that, I know buying only supports...but I wish I could buy all the current victims, too. 

Sucks that puppy killmills need to feel it in their wallets to make a change...because that wallet dent is probably going to amount to animal lives :/
Pet stores make me sick
Poor dogs living in 50x50 cm cage.
this is a sad video. pet stores are evil and they sell puppies from horrible puppy mills just for profit. 
That is actually a grocery store in Korea.
PSA:  if you got a puppy or dog from a store or breeder and it has health problems, some states have puppy lemon laws.  In California you can get a 150% refund on the dog (and keep the dog) to cover vet bills.

Source: happened to me even from a reputable breeder.  Invoked lemon law and got purchase price plus 50% to cover his vet bills.
See the pup in the bottom cage :(
poor thing just wants to get out of that hellhole
places like this are honestly evil
There are so many things wrong with pet stores whom work with puppy/kitty mills. Where I am it’s sheltered animas only, except fish. And I’m still sad about Betta’s. Plus other animals. I hope that eventually we get to the point where mills are non existent, and adoption becomes the norm. 
This is actually sad af. 
This breaks my heart.
Nothing about that cage is aww.
Pet stores make me sad. 
I'm so glad selling dogs in a pet store isn't a thing in the UK. Couldn't stand seeing those dogs in small perspex boxes 
Omg he doesn’t want to be locked in a tiny glass case? Adorable!
Buy from a reputable breeder.
Why is the dog in a hamster area? 

Videos happy but boxed doggo seems kinda cruel. 
Adopt don't shop!
Albeit cute, these places are notoriously horrendous for any animal, not just dogs. Just look at the box that it's kept in, no wonder it wants out. 😔
If this lady didn't buy/adopt this puppers after its 3 cute suicidal jumps, then she has a heart of stone.
r/depressing
Endearing but sad all rolled into one. 
Buying a Dog Out of the Box? Sry you sucks a lot....Just idiots founding such shops and just bigger idiots go in and buy sth/somebody there..... Let the Shit storm begin. 
Adopt don’t shop. Put these places out of business please. 
We’re upvoting puppy mill dogs now?
I see a lot of the #adoptdontshop thing. But the small little caveat I will throw out is this. It is clear some shelters don't want to have successful adoptions. Back a few years I was in a Petco. They teamed up with a local shelter. A cat was in the store that I fell in love with instantly.

So I inquire about adopting her. This is what they wanted in order for me to start the process:

Copies of my Paystubs
2 years of tax returns
3 months of bank statements
Letter from my landlord or copy of my mortgage statement
Required pet insurance
2 letters of recommendation

I get wanting to know if you have the money to take care of the pet. But no fucking way am I giving you that much information. And that is why puppy Mills still exist. It is so easy to go and buy then go through a massive amount of paperwork to adopt.

Adoption should be safe but EASY. Not like applying for a 2nd mortgage.
There isn't anything cute about puppies being sold in this way. Unethical and irresponsible, no animal lover should think this is OK. 
This is not a AWW moment, i hate pet stores that sell dogs behind glass boxes like that...
Adopt, do not shop, boys and girls.
The little daredevil
Store worker?
Let me out, let me out, this is not a dance!
dang it lady! i am trying to jump off this ledge stop saving me
Can't refuse that 😍
No lady you don't understand, you are taking me home, and that's it.

This is basically how I got my dog at an animal shelter; they opened the cage and she grabbed on and wouldn't let go. 
It’s a Ghost pupper 
Same thing happened to me while visiting the SPCA last year for our second adopted kitten. Our newest family member (now), jumped right out of her enclosure just as this puppy did. Unfortunately she did her landing with claws out. Luckily I was wearing a thicker shirt that day.
Its fucked up for me. They are acting like it is some kind of toy...
IF THEY DONT I WILL.
The face of the little one in the bottom left corner who isn’t getting any love is just breaking my heart..

Edit: and of course, it should go without saying,  puppy mills are bad :(
You can buy dogs from shops where they live in tanks? That seems prrtty fucked...and like it sets up dog impulse buying which is also fucked of the pretty variety 
Please tell me the puppy went home with you.
This is MLM salespeople jumping into your inbox over and over 
Nothing say r/aww like a puppy mill 🙃
Wasn’t there a post a while ago from r/AskReddit about Redditors who had worked in pet stores as employees, and the horror stories pretty much all of them had about working in shops like these?
Just like picking out a live lobster, same idea for dogs in china! #poodlesandnoodles
This is why i cant visit the animal shelter. I will leave with a fluff everytime!
Aren't those display cases way too small for dogs?
Adopt, don't shop (or drop).
r/floof
That dog has a lot of faith the human will catch it.
What breed of dog is that?
Anyone know what kind of dog this is?
Buying pups and cute and all but y’all ever heard of adopting and giving a doggo a second chance?
You have been chosen. Take me with you, human!
The last time she does it is gonna be bad for the dog.
The downside to this is you know you are getting involved with a hyper puppy and many owners don't understand what this entails.

I've seen shitty owners buy a dog like his because it was cute in the store but they would keep it caged because it was a high energy dog and they didn't know what they were getting into in the long run.
Clearly, that dog has ZERO trust issues. 
"Location, Location, Location" -the dog caged below eye level, probably
That dog in the bottom left pawing at the glass :((
It's all fun and games til pup brings up the MLM it's secretly peddling. 
This is why I adopt from shelters or mom-and-pop breeders. There should be a law against keeping puppies in a little box like that.😡
Wow, I remember when I was a kid (80s and 90s) they had pet stores like these in the mall and in shopping centers. They gradually disappeared (thank goodness) so it’s surprising to see this. I guess other countries still have them, unless this is a shelter but the glass window boxes look very much like those pet stores. The video is very cute but the subtext in incredibly sad because that dog wants to eat out of there so badly. 
I hope that fluffer was purchased by that lady
That dog is having a mental breakdown, no dog should be sold from a pet store and made to sit in an cage like that.

That’s just evil.
Puppy be like f this life ain't worth living no more!
What stores actually have puppies like this? 
Pet stores sell dogs from puppy mills. 
Pet shops make me feel sad
I’ve never seen a pet shop irl with puppies and kittens. Just mice, ferrets, Guiana pigs and hamsters. As well as the usual birds, fish, reptiles and bugs. It’s depressing to see the small animals in there, I can’t imagine how sad it would be to see puppies and kittens caged up like this. 
Didn’t even know this exists in real life. Buying dog like a hamster...
Anybody who would keep a puppy in a horrible little skinner box like that (or support a business who does) is a psychopath. 
LOVE ME
To add to the horrific stories about pet stores, adding that the good news is most of the pet stores in my area don't sell animals but show adoptable animals from the local shelters, anyways the story is that a pet store in West Edmonton Mall closed down and left the animals unattended for. Someone notified the authorities who were able to go in and Rescue the Animals, I think it was Birds, fish, and reptiles.
Please tell me you brought this dog home 
The leap of faith. Very cute.
I hope that pet stores get banned everywhere.  
They are such awful places, and so many people buy on impulse because "it looks so cute" take it home,  it starts to eat lots/shit/ grow and people end up dumping them.  The.  Worst.
Before this thread, I didn't even know pet stores could sell dogs. I guess it's banned in the UK or something.
[deleted]
Blasted puppy mills.
Everyone is saying ‘don’t buy animals, adopt them, blah blah blah’ as if it’s the fault of the animal that they come from somewhere with such bad practices. But this is not a black and white issue. Supporting places like puppy mills and the like is horrible but what is the other option? Leaving these dogs and cats to never find a forever home? To never be happy with someone who will love them?
No buy. Only adopt. 
Adopt. You get the same dogs and don't support assholes. 
Buying dogs is for terrible people.
nothing "aww" about this :(
Never buy always adopt. We don't deserve dogs. 
Poor thing. Adopt don't shop.
That is pretty sad. 
Weird seeing dogs being sold like that in pet shops. I'm sure it's illegal in the UK, seems inhumane.
I hate pet shops. Disgusting. Hundreds of rescue dogs need loving homes. Please adopt and put these places out of business. 
Yeah "awww" until you realize that is a fucking puppy-mill shop.
Should be forbidden
Dog probably comes from a puppy mill.  Horrible to keep them in those cages.  People shouldn't buy dogs from pet stores for that reason, you are supporting puppy mills. 
W.T.F... NEVER buy a dog!
save me from this horrible lonely little cage you bitch.
This is just sad... I hate Asian pet stores–they often do little or nothing to keep the dogs in good health and most just want to get the fuck out of those tiny cages... poor things (p.s. I am Asian)
Never ever ever buy a dog from a pet store.  If you *must* have a purebred dog, look up a rescue for that breed, or contact a *reputable* breeder.  Do your research!!  Or, even better, adopt a mutt from the shelter.  Mutts tend to have fewer issues than purebreds anyway.
I hate stores like this :( 

There was one like it when I lived in Vancouver which was downright cruel.

Dogs are not meant to be kept in bloody tanks all day and night!!!
If she didn’t buy that pupper I totally would. 

And before I catch crap from all you “adopt don’t shop” people:  your hatred of the industry should not prevent that little ball of fluff from going to a good home. You want change, go bribe some politicians like everyone else. It’ll work faster than telling people not to open their hearts and homes to the furry critters.  

Fun fact, where I live the pet stores don’t sell cats and dogs.  They have an arrangement with the local shelters and adopt out pets from them. 
This doesn't make me "aww", it makes me think of that puppy's parents who are being horribly mistreated in a puppy mill somewhere!
90% chance that dog came from a puppy mill    :[
Pet stores sound so innocent at first. You go to the pet store to buy a pet.

But in reality they're such a monstrosity.
Fuck petstores.
Puppy mills and the people that run them and straight detestable things. They aren’t human. They are lower than the animal shit they scrape off the bottom of their shoes. 

One thing to look at positively is that I am seeing close to no pets being sold in privately owned stores. Non-chain stores to be more exact. When I was younger they were all over the place.

We can never save all of the homeless and abused animals but we can damn sure try. How are puppy mills even still a thing? How have they not been so criminalized that things don’t even attempt to try and set one up? If we can’t even get things like that right then how can we expect more serious problems to be fixed?
So depressing and fucked up seeing the other cages that contain puppies that would love do to the same, but likely will never get a chance to, and that's forgetting the place those puppies came from. 
Go to a f-ing shelter. 
[removed]
Awww a dog that has to sit in a little cage all day so people can make money, so cute... holy shit some people are retarded 
AdoPt DoN’t SHoP. 
Fuck pet stores man.
That shit is fucked up. Are there really pet shops like that? It's puppy farming. Inhumane.
Fuck puppy mills. Adopt/rescue instead
Fuck you, "Pet Store".  
Adopt animals from a local shelter. Don't support stores that sell pets.
I'd take that dog in a heartbeat
Don’t buy pets...
Is that a dog for sale *in a store*? Where does that happen? :O
I'm a bit skeptical.
This looks like a pet store, so the dog may he tought to do that, so buyers get instant connection and buy dogs more often. 
Cool marketing, if true.
selling dogs at pet shops :(
Cute but a shame to think the pup is probably from a puppy mill. Downer, I know, but adopt!!!
Adopt don't shop
people who buy those puppy mill dogs are just as bad as the breeders
WELL LOOK HOW SMALL THAT BOX IS!! JESUS HOW IS THIS LEGAL ANYWHERE?!?!?! 
Shouldn't be buying from these damn pet stores. Like a corporate puppy mill
This is cute, but seriously, fuck pet stores that keep dogs in little glass boxes like that. It's just wrong. 
downvoting this video. #adoptdontshop
Oh look, a puppy mill
Adopt don’t buy
seriously. stop selling dogs in fucking pet stores. 
please never BUY animals :( ADOPT instead. so many great animals in need of great people like you and would appreciate it so much more. visit your local shelter <3
All these people saying adopt don't shop. If no one ever buys from a shop all the shop animals just end up in shelters anyways all animals need a home
Are pet stores still legal in the US? I had no idea!

Here in Spain they were banned some years ago, and I am so happy about it, I always thought they were cruel and all the puppies come from puppy mills :/
One day we'll stop selling dogs on store shelves and look back on when we did in shame. Adopt your dogs, don't support a cruel industry.
Adopt, don't shop. 
Fuck a puppy mill
Don't buy dogs...ADOPT some from your local shelter
Is this is the US? I’ve never seen anything like this in the UK (our pet shops only ever have rodents, birds, fish, rabbits, guineas - NEVER dogs or cats!) I absolutely did not realise what these pet stores were like, why are they in such tiny boxes? With no toys? Or a proper bed? This is utterly disgusting. Why are there no welfare laws about this? 
#AdoptDontShop 
Adopt don't buy!
There is nothing aww about a pet store.
Such a catch 22: you want to get him out of that hell hole but shouldn’t contribute to the horrible puppy mill/pet store system 😭
Pet shops! Breeding animals into captivity for profit! Gotta love em!!
Wow, fuck you who still buy dogs like this. Theres a seat next to Hitler after you die
There's barely anything aww about a pet store like this.
I wish r/aww would stop letting people post gifs of literally petshops who sell animals from puppy mills. 

This isn't a joke. Seriously - adopt don't shop..
Puppies in cages....complete bullshit. Isn’t this outlawed?  Should be. 
Also a very good loop.
man, I'm glad dogs sold out of pet stores are a thing of the past.
Where is this? Is it even legal to have dogs in these types of cages? 
Why are pet stores like this still legal? My only real experience of them was in Japan (but I know this style is also common in the US, don't really have them in the UK as much) and it's so heartbreaking to think these little guys sit in a bright, hard box for weeks until they get sold. And if they don't I dread to think what happens with them :/ Yet these gifs always get shitloads of upvotes because "daww so cute" but nobody stops to think about it.

Yeah, humans have a lot of shit to sort out about our own race but we should seriously treat other species with more damn respect. It disgusts me, honestly.
#  ADOPT DON'T SHOP!!  All Animals that are imprisoned in Pet Stores, need to be adopted, and then, NO Animal should EVER be allowed to be sold in Pet Stores.
there are stores like this for puppys? :O

So happy and so already trusting of his new owner lol 
What if you dont buy that dog and he tries to jump on someone who will not grab him? Trust issues for rest of his life.
Do you think this is a f**king game?
My manager says to always put the product in the hands of the customer. I wonder if this counts.
I remember seeing these types of pet stores throughout Hong Kong. I have no idea how anyone could own a dog in that city with tiny ass apartments.
That is the biggest little leap I’ve ever seen.

How can someone enter a place like this and leave it again? All those dogs left behind, i couldnt...i just couldnt
“Huuu-yip!”

The one in bottom is looking on hoping hes next

Even if the dog falls, it's large fluff to weight ratio ensures that it will have a nice, slow descent.
This is just wrong. I'm sure that puppy has more than enough money to buy the woman but is just playing with her instead

Omg she had BETTER taken that goodboi home, seriously.

That dog is coming home with me!
That poor dog at the bottom would be me.
Do what she says!
r/gifsthatkeepongiving !
I need to get a dog right now
Is this Japan?  I was just there and found the pet stores INCREDIBLY expensive. Like $3500 dollars for those designer dogs. It bummed me out because while it looked like they were being taken care of... A whole lot more would be taken care of if it was looked at as an adoption and not for profit. 
Sweet puppy needs a home!

Puppy love everyone on first sight
Anyone notice that poor dog down below pawing at the glass?
The wand chooses the wizard Mr Potter 
So cute how there's just box after box with dogs.
It reminds me of that little white dog from Secret Life of Pets
While pet stores *are* terrible, there is **no way** that pupper sat around waiting to be adopted.
Leap and Annette will appear. Well, that’s what I guess her name is. 
What type of dog is it?

Thing looks like it'll bark 90% of the day
It's all fun and games till they go to the cliffs on holiday
You should just not catch him once just to see what happens..

This is like bedtime with my toddler.  
My phone just exploded from cuteness
Can someone verify story with happy ending? 
Seriously, buy this trusting little guy and get him out of there. That's so sad :(
Almost looks like a store employee training this overpriced pooch to ‘sell itself’.
you can't even walk away because it'll jump and commit puppy suicide... 
This is the first time I said 'aww' out loud while scrolling 'aww'
I'm guessing that woman is annoyed because he keeps jumping out. He looks so cuddly btw
looks like petland - an american chain store that sells dogs in tanks like this

'I've caught a cloud!' 
This is basically how we adopted our cat. At the pet store, he was the sweest little thing -- rubbed his face in our hair, kisses, purring, most adorable kitten ever. Flash forward 6 months, only affectionate the wife, could care less if I'm alive or dead, only wants attention from me when food is involved. Wife likes to rub it in my face that it's "her cat now", too. I'm thinking about leaving both of them over it.

Pupper was excited at the opportunity to escape, not at hooman...
"This is not a dance..."
Just walk away...
It's vicious! Look how it jumps in for the attack!
I do not advocate for letting any die. I do not see why you assumed that. If you read my comment, I stated that as a society we would have to deal with the unwanted victims of that industry. There are great people and organizations that specialize in rehabilitating mill dogs. 
Just don’t drop water on it, or feed it after midnight. 
As happy as that is, the dog below. :(

Why won't you let me love you?
If this isn’t my dog. These dogs these days, like oh we about to have fun.
All i can see is the little dog in the lower left who also wants a turn :(
Sold after the first jump!
Get out!!!! 
Poor poocher in the bottom left :(
Welp we know who’s house is about to reek of piss. 
Who said anything about buying
hahahahaha

Well.......ya get her/him?
Lemminghound.
Only 399
Yaaaaaay puppy farms are the best
I don’t think buy is the correct term
That one below is like "meh, try hard!"
That's one trusting dog, just jumping like that over a pretty sharp drop.
r/tippytaps 
>Fluffy puppy

Fluppy
She is the chosen one!
Anyone know what type of dog this is?
Amazin😎😎
I support this decision
God damn that's cute
It's 2018, and pet shops are still a thing.

*sigh*
OH MY GODS, I WANT THAT PUPPY. RIGHT NOW. *flails*
Thats just cruel man.
I have two hopes for this.  First, that she took the puppy home because it obviously loves her.  Second, hopefully that is a pet store that only offers rescues for adoption.(That’s how the mall pet stores are by me, they only offer rescues for adoption, as it should be).  Pet store are horrible and only care about their bottom line, they do not care about the quality or where the puppies come from.  
Trust fall!
This might be a dog vending machine
Lol cutie, it ain't by force.
Damn this dog must trast the humen kind! Fortunately not like the humen kind his self....
I *need* that dog.
r/aww
Just walk away. He'll get the picture.
I would buy all of them
you would probably try to get the fuck out of a tiny cage too...
This is just sad, cute but sad 
Did she?!!!
Adopt, don't buy
So precious 😍
If I was going to get a puppy we’re should I get it?
I couldn’t even walk past this shop let alone go in there. Fuck that, I’d be walking out with so many animals 
Leaps of faith
STOP PUTTING HIM BACK, TAKE HIM AT ONCE
...then OP puts the doggo back in it's cage, closes the door tight and smiles frivolously, blatantly ignoring the repetitive tapping and barking that is now getting ever so quieter as OP walks to her car.
I hope you bought it.
Dat vertical leap 
Just. Take. My. Money.
This dog is very cute
No, just the breeds the thread was mentioning like bulldogs etc. I thought u were the one making the comment about breeding dogs to look a certain way and they other had health problems. For example bad hips and such
Wouldn't even put it back it's too cute !
Asian countries tend to treat pets more like products and less like family members...
Me, jumping into relationships that don’t want me. 
please adopt people!
Pet stores are evil :( 
Don't you dare leave him there. You take him home RIGHT NOW.
Putting living beings inside small glass display cases for sale makes me a sad. Breaks my heart.
Reckless speculation here but to me it seems like a place that buys from a puppy mill. And these dogs are trained to jump in anyone's arm. tin foil opinion here.
If only it was “adopt me!”.
I bought two Yorkies, who I love to bits, until I discovered the joys of rescues. I’ve now got 4 more dog
Its cute
What breed of dog is this? Pom? Do they stay this small?
i heard adoption in japan is an absolute nightmare
i always wondered how / why people bought small yappy "dogs." Well now I know that they don't really get much of a choice!
I know everyone says we shouldn't buy from let stores but if we don't then these poor guys don't get a home. It sucks they're breeders out from factories like this but we.might need to do  it so these guys get a home
what kind of puppy is this?
Fuck it, buy them all! 
CUTE ALERT!
So sad pets all don’t have homes 
This is really awful!!! Mammal animals should be sold like that....that unkind attitude to dogs, cats and other mammals!
Awww the little pupper below like 'What about mee!?? I can play too!'   :(
Wtf this turned my eyes in to Water.
STOP IT. 
Love the preparing tippy taps!
She's yours now!
I almost bought that doggo right off the .gif itself
You better had bought that damn dog.
A million dollars and NO MORE!!!
Omg my heart
/u/macronicro
Oh gosh, how can you say no ?! 
Christ please tell me you did
Is that a Samoyed?
This dog will never learn the consequences for making that jump if they keep getting caught.... 
Love this 😍
She better have adopted him
What country is this??
WHAT A CUTE DOG.GIVE ME THE DOG
Probably trying to get out of the tiny fucking box it's cramped up in
I am so happy now.
Looks like Japan. I lived in Tokyo and these pet shops selling puppies and kittens are everywhere. They usually sell miniature breeds for ridiculously high prices -$2000+. The Japanese love dressing their tiny dogs up like babies and walking around with them in strollers.
It’s a disgusting business and those that don’t sell get PTS.
Yeah.... that’s fucked 
So that’s what a “leap of faith” looks like
DID YOU BUY THE DOG?!
That's how pretty girls turn down boys.. 
This is so adorable!
Does anyone know where this video was taken? There's an awful lot of bandwagon talk about the horrid conditions of pet stores and puppy mills. I agree that puppy mills are typically terrible places and breeders are some of the most irritating and difficult people on this earth, in my experience with them. However, I don't see any evidence from this video alone of such deplorable treatment of the animals. I work at a Vet clinic and we often work with rescue organizations that adopt out stray animals in need of homes at the very same pet stores many of you are trashing. I think it's a great opportunity to reach a heavily trafficked place of people.
shes training this poor puppy to kill itself...
If that is in japan , the puppy is in for a nasty surprise if he doesn’t get bought after 7 weeks. 
I love dogs, but not to an extent that I would consider myself a "dog person." But it would really mess with my head to have to walk away from a dog that did that to me. 
What if the pet shops could train their dogs to act adorable and petty, just so the visitors buy them?
It’s a wooferang
I will adopt him 😍
I wonder if they teach them to do that for increased sales...tin foil hat theory of the day lol
Huh! 

Thanks for the info. That’s really good to know!
What breed is this?
"and would you like to buy the optional accidental death pet insurance today?" 
God only knows where your adopted mutt came from. Shpuld they just leave it in the class showroom case so it will go to where or whom?
O my mother fudginggod....that's too cute
Did she but the puppy??? I can't find it.
You are the chosen one
How can she resist?
Literally flying off the shelves. 

Do they still sell dogs in pet stores? Boycott.
Did she buy him??

So... did she buy it? Someone please tell me she bought it 
Was I the only person thinking “please stop doing that because you might not catch it” stressed me out! 
This is just wrong. I'm sure that puppy has more than enough money to buy the woman but is just playing with her instead
A visitor entered the Mercedes. Mercas come out of their necks and pull Grandfather out of Zaporozhe. And grandfather calmly says:
- Guys, why get angry. Come on, we'd better drink tea and eat gingerbreads.
- Grandpa, are you crazy? We're going to your apartment to rewrite us!
- Guys, respect some older! We will drink tea with gingerbreads, we will talk ...
My colleagues exchanged glances, but nothing. They followed the grandfather. And instead of going to a pub, he leads them to the park. They sit on a bench, grandfather pulls out an old brass lamp, rubs and gin appears. Grandpa to him:
- Organize tea and gingerbread for those gentlemen and for me.
- Yes, sir! - replied the genie and indeed, a table materialized from the air, with a tablecloth, samovar, gingerbreads, a dishware. The necks sit with dropping jaws, after a while one of them gathers up and says:
- Grandfather, sell us this lamp.
- No!
- Sell, I give you ten thousand baks!
- Well, what are you, I will not sell!
- Fifty thousand!
In the end, they bought a lamp for a quarter of a million. My grandfather went back to the car and drove off. The head of the neck rubs the lamp. Gin appears. His neck is:
- Look, now I'm the boss here. You are about to organize ten million baks to start with!
- Excuse me, new ladies, but I specialize only in tea and gingerbread ..
My dream is to have a cute dog in a big house and take it for a walk every day.
I swear to god, if they didn’t get that dog... i don’t mean buy I mean smuggle out of that hellhole.
He can fit in a large purse or backpack. Just saying.
never fear brain, the husband will not find out. **scrolls through 2 more Sub-Reddit threads**
I don't think this is cute. Look at the poor little thing in the lower cubby.
This is fucked up and the fact this is on this sub is fucked up. Animal cruelty isn’t cute or funny
Adapt, Don’t shop!!!!
I can't believe it's legal in your country to sell puppies like that?! Fucking horrible :(
I'm sorry but is this normal? To have animals on shelves like a product to be bought? I've been in many pet stores, even own one and I've never seen such a thing. Must be America or something I guess
As cute as this is, anyone who BUYS dogs should be crucified
What breed of floof is this?
This is how you get thousands of karma.   
OP don't leave us hanging yo... Did she buy the dog? Or both dogs? I seriously wanna know! 
So cute. I hope that anyone adopted him
The $5000 bill from the orthopedic surgeon will be less adorable. 
I hope she adopted it. Otherwise it is going to jump again with the next customer who won't be ready to catch it.
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen this week!
What breed of dog is this? 
If a dog did this to me, it would have a new home cause omg so cute. 
Animal stores are so fucked up in every way from the incest ridden creatures they sell to the ridiculous high prices.

Fuck that. I'll try to be a good friend for man best friend

You'd better have bought that pupper.
Just stop it and buy that puppy already!
Omg that's so cute.. 😍
This is actually the most depressing GIF on reddit.
BUY THE DAMN DOG FOR PETES SAKE!
SOMEBODY PLAY WITH THE DOG IN THE BOTTOM LEFT CAGE.

Also, to all the ignorant comments here about not buying dogs at a Petco: Petco and PetSmart almost always partner with local animal shelters. The dogs and cats on display are on loan from the animal shelters, and only for ~3 days at a time until they go back to the shelters.

Source: worked at a Petco in college.
God I hate pet stores. 
Looks like a high-tech Asian puppy farm.
Never buy a pet!! Always Adopt!!
I cannot stand these puppy mills. Buy from the SPCA
awwwwwwwwwww :'(
you think this is a fucking game?
As much as I hate pet stores that sell dogs like this, I hate the people who buy the dogs even more.
ADOPT DONT SHOP 
TAKE ME OUT OF THIS HELL HOLE PLS
Is this seriously a fucking pet store? It’s 2018! People get with the program- pet stores are awful places. I can’t believe we’ve come so far as a society and yet we still allow pet stores! Shame on us as a society!
If this were me, I'd have no will power to not take that dog home with me. 
So puppy mills are aww now?
It’s so fluffy I’m gonna dieee
Pet stores are evil. Put them out of business and rescue a companion. All animals deserve better

Adorable yet heartbreaking.
Disgusting 
Hope she ended up buy that cute thing!!
She shouldn't play with her food like that....
I know pet shops are bad because the dogs come from puppy mills, but...what are we supposed to do with puppies than come from puppy mills?
Awww... I pray to God you took her home!!  ❤
There's a pet store at my local mall, and their dogs die all of the time 😢 

Bastards, those people...
Too bad it looks like a pet store. Remember, people, dogs from shelters are much more deserving of a home than ones from pet stores. /s
my god I hate ambiguous endings like this.. SO DID SHE ADOPT THE BALL OF CUTIE PATOOTIE OR NOT??? SOURCE?? IS THE PUPPERS RESCUED WHERE IS IT NOW
People always have something to complain about. You sell Africans... people complain. You sell Pomeranians... people complain.
well, is cute, why not buy the puppy?
I swear OP if you didn't buy that pup you are on fucking notice. Even if this is a repost, it's still going to be your fault.
He’s yours seriously just get him!
I love food shopping
[deleted]
Just buy the jumping mashed potatoes already! 
Pleeeeease buy the doggie!!! 😭😭😭😭
This dog + fire + soy sauce = tasty little snack.
