If you don't love drinking from the hose you're the weirdo.  I'm 30 and just had to use a hose for the first time in a while recently and hell yeah I was spraying the flowers half and half with in my mouth.
Always remember to water ur horse
What‚Äôs the point of spraying water on leaves though?
When your dog child gets jealous of your plant children.
Question: I often read how breeds with very short/stubbed snouts have health issues.  Is the reverse true as well? Would breeds with very long snouths be extra healthy in that regard?
What kind of breed is this long boi? Anyone know? My best friend Google couldn‚Äôt help with this
That dog is part anteater.
That's a cute furry plant you have there!
My iguana does this. But she spells it ‚Äúspray‚Äù.

Please make sure and water both your plants and your horse.

Such an adorable horse.

Dogs compete with our attention to other dogs, to cats, to children, and now they are even competing with plants for our attention. They want all our attention forever and always.
That's a very polite horse you've got!

His nose is that long by default?
Look at that S N O O T
My rough coated collie (think Lassie if you‚Äôre not familiar) had a very long snoot. I did some research and found out that borzoi was added to the blood line about 60-80 years ago.
thirsty noodle
I like your horse
His nose looks like it evolved just for this.  So cute!
jesus that dog has a long face
Borzoi mix???????
Not a greyhound (my favorite breed since childhood)...is this a Saluki? Or Borzoi? Just curious.... The snoot looking for squirty water is adorable. I remember the retired racing greyhound my husband and I adopted years ago...we happened to be watering the backyard lawn once with the hose and he just ran back and forth through the spray in absolute bliss, and then approached the sprinkler end of the hose to try and drink the fresh water.
What are you doing, step-dog?
Snoot dogg
Now I know where all the pug noses went.
I like how the nose comes in from off-screen, and you don't even see the eyes at first.
Horse puppy demands hydration
What breed is this dog??? It's so majestic
Loongggg loonngggg maaaannnnnn
Just FYI you're not suppose to mist your indoor plants leaves unless it's very well ventilated (ie have a fan blowing on them or if they're beside open windows).
My dog drinks from the pool
If you give me sparys today, then I'll gladly pee on your plant Tuesday.

Ohmygod precious
ive never seen a dog with such a big snoot:0
That's cute
Now image that dog on a gun range
Don't water your plants like this. Big leafs are like solar panels. The roots are what suck up the water. Water the soil directly. Watering the leaves just attracts more bugs and makes it easier for diseases to spread to the plant.

Although these are indoor plants so these are probably less of a concern. Even so, not sure why you'd water the leaves like that unless I'm just unfamiliar w/ taking care of these plants.

Also, cute dog!
Why the long face bro?
Why the long face
Looonnng snoot
thats not a snoot. thats a snoooooooot
This is gonna end up in We Rate Dogs with the caption: "This is the ultra rare Doggo Plantis. 14/10 would water every day."

We use a spray bottle to keep our dogs off the bed and other furniture. It does not work well with our boxer because he likes to drink out of the spray bottle as well.
Don't forget to water the dog for healthy growth!
Ah, but of course. Some of the finest sparys for you, kind sir.
Longdog is long
That gorgeous face!  So elegant a nose!
According to a well-known song:

*He chews on the shrubbery*

*And drinks from the hose*
Lorge Snooba
My now deceased puppet used to do this with the vacuum. She would get in the way sometimes so you‚Äôd run the brush tool along her. She loved it.
Why do you spray the leaves? Does it just supplement the moisture in between waterings?
Oh my God I want your dog LOL I have two pit bulls and I use the spray bottle to correct them when they are doing some thing I don‚Äôt want. One of them is terrified of the spray bottle and runs away but the other one love it it runs right up to me and opens her mouth for me to spray. Yeah I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm gonna do about her LMAO
My GSD absolutely HATED water spray and it was a good way to tell her something wasn't allowed.

Meanwhile my two labs would try to eat the spray...
Dat nose

You can lead a horse to plant, and he will drink anyway
He was a touch parched
* nematode voice* Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty, thirsty!!!
My fave is how after his first sip, you start to move the bottle over to the plant, but his nose stays in camera. ‚ÄúAh ah ah, not quite finished there..‚Äù
Those eyes are... Convincingly thirsty
Well that's just fucking adorable. He's so gentle. I love hims!

For every one plant you water, you also have to water your one dog
"I dont have a spray to spare!"
Why is there a horse inside
My cockatiel whenever I pick up the spray bottle.

"Oh hey I see you're holding the bath machine. Wait where are you going with it? SPRAY ME"
My cat does this too. But he doesn't want to drink it, he wants to be wet. You spray anything and he's right in front of you making you spray him instead. Once he's dripping he'll luck it off. He's a weird one but i love my boy.
He can smell things even on mars or other planets
Oh so that‚Äôs why they evolved to have such long snouts
Looking at the skeletal structure of one of these breeds and a pug, I would never believe they are the same species.
I are plant!
Beautiful dog! I use a spray bottle of water for when i fix my daughters' hair & my dog isn't so gentle. She snaps at it, hates the look or even the sound of the spray. She barks & won't ease up til it goes away.
