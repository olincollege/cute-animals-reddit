Looks like its calling for  help lol

This is what we cat owners affectionately refer to as a "struggle cuddle".
Is that Bill the Cat’s long-lost brother?
A face swap on this would just be the  same ipcture.

Good one, hope he is alive tho.

500k karma in a year, I swear some people....
It's a great pic but OP just stole it.  This cat is named Zimes and his tongue is stuck permanently out from a pitbull attack.  It's cute still but so much Reddit content is disguised as original; it's just reposts of other peoples' fine moments.

Makes me sad sometimes; Reddit is quite a phony façade of wholesome, OG content.
That cat is literally how neonazis look when they salute.
Lady, yu r squeezing the tongue outta ur cat!! 😛
I hope she isn't from the UK or she'll have a court date very soon.
why she put him in a chokehold?
Is she choking it ??? . Remind me with the Simpson Cat.
This woman is very, very attractive
Straight from a cartoon like.

This is a repost.
Poor cat

Hail kitler
I love this picture!
Looks pretty perfect to me!
Meme template?
First thing I saw this morning! Love it
A new meme template is born :)
r/animalsbeingderps
As a dog owner, when someone says they are a “cat owner”, this is exactly the picture that pops up in my mind.
Nazi cat
I’ve seen this one a few times today from different accounts. Kinda feel like the OP should be getting some credit. 🤷‍♂️
r/AnimalsBeingDerps
Omg that is funny!!
how is this on r/aww
Best pic ever
I remember seeing this posted by the real OP during my shelter at home order. This picture is wild.
This is totes adorbs. You should print it out as a greeting card / holiday card and send it to friends and family lol. They'd get a great laugh out of it.
That cat looks like it's mocking Hitler. Good job Lil Chaplin, good job.
Poor cat
It's like taking selfie with a drunken friend. Lol
That is adorable as hell
This is so cute.
Blepppp
This one is a perfect selfie.
Ooo😍 cute💕
Meow. Do be a good kitty!

Edit:  was supposed to say "That do be a good kitty!" Meow works too!
Help me! Someone save me from this hooman

"And I'll hug'em, and squeez'em..."
Hahaha
I love that she looks derpy too. Love it. 😁
Jezz cat is such drama queen
Dreamworks script-writers be like:   
"Yup, That's me. The one on the left of course. How did I get into this you ask? Well it all started with..."
British SOE operative strangles unaware SS officer giving Nazi salute at a parade in Northern France c. 1944 (colorized).
I think that cat is secretly a Nazi.
The cat seems more committed to the theme of the selfie. The woman is too photogenic.
Poor little I'm pretty sure he/she need more air at that time LoL!
Do you call him George?

Edit:  Getting downvoted?  Maybe my references have become too obscure and I've become that old man with the weird sense of humor ha ha!! Video reference to "George" below...

Do you mind me making this a meme template?

Can a League of Legends artist turn this into Lux and Yuumi?
Her skin is camouflaged in with the wall, no wonder the cat never saw her sneaking up.

Aww, look at cute Elmyra all grown up!
When you both indulge in a little cat nip
Reminds me of toothless lol
The cats tongue, istg, looks like a pink airhead

Plot twist: the cat was dead, it died like that
Based cat
OMG this would be my profile picture forever!
I would frame and hang it . That truly is a keeper.
Nice...
That cat is both stunning and brave
Hail kitler

How can you say the perfect selfie doesn't exist?!  This is **perfect**!
This should be the catlady face :)

Furher cat 🐈
The cat looks stupid too
That cat looks like the real world equivalent of the cat from the Simpson's Itchy and Scratchy...
Sieg Meow 🇩🇪
My ex used to handle her cat like this and couldn't understand why the cat developed a hatred for being picked up.
You look like Freydis from Vikings
Getting real Elmyra from the tiny toons vibes from this. "I'll love them and hug them and hold them forever!"
Soviet anthem starts playing
Elmyra Duff vibes
The cat's face is so strangely human
So true.  That’s hilarious!
Dirpalicious.

Derpy cat and owner expressions...  the cat totally nailed it.

10/10 effective choke hold
As an expert breeder, I must say that it is a purebred cat, namely a nazi cat, LoL! What a pose and face! xD
Owner: "Mr. Cuddles, come here."

Mr. Cuddles: "NEIN, NEIN, NEIN!"

The cat looks like toothless from how to train your dragon

That cat is smothered by love.

The thumbnail looks like she is posing next to a Big Black Cat
I give you....[https://youtu.be/r-kyEqE6os8?t=20](https://youtu.be/r-kyEqE6os8?t=20)
I sure hope that this ends up framed, and on your wall.
I think your cat might be a Nazi.
Heil Kittler!!!
The cat is hailing hitler

Nice choke hold
Elmyra Duff is that you?
Not her being goofy, I-
They both actually look like this!  All the time!
Nazi cat
Clearly the cat (unlike the person in the picture) is not a hugger....

I can translate the cats facial expression for you..... "HAAAAALP ME, I CAN'T BREATHE!!!!!"
Nazi cat
HEIL FUR MEINE FUHRER!
"Just what I always wanted. My own little bunny rabbit. I will name him George, and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him... "
A  woman with an intellectual disability doing her part, strangling a Nazi supporting cat.
Kinda looks like she putting a choke hold on the cat.
HEIL KITLER!!!!
First thought was that she was holding fresh roadkill.
Dana Scully?
Oh another bratticus catticus, I have one of these. ‘Hoomans are weird and gross sumtiems... Meow.’
So now this sub is promoting the nazi salute?  Her and her cat need to be cancelled!
Hail cathitler?
Black cat has a question.
Elmyra Duff?

This reminds me of Elmira from Tiny Toons Adventures and her cat.
This cat is about to form a new reichstag

Heil Kitler!
That’s not a selfie. It’s an ussie.

Nazi cat isn’t real he can’t hurt you.

Nazi cat:

Best portrait of Pepé Le Pew and Penelope!
Like Reddit another girl, better prepare your meaningless awards and useless internet points to uPd0oT it to the next level!

Choking a cat for internet points.
Why dous your cat look dead
It looks like he’s overacting being strangled
Yes, that’s the perfect selfie right there!! Hee hee. Loving the cat tongue and sheer panic as she/he wonders what on earth is going on. (I so wish our pets knew we were just trying to say that we love them! Hee hee)
Everything, from the cat's tongue hanging out to the maniacally dangerous vibe this chick gives off, is perfection.
YOOO I GOT CAKEDAY LESSS GOOOO
Hey baby ...if me and you both met in middle.... We would redifine autism as we be the center of spectrum...

Well done OP 👏

Who are you quoting? Who said the perfect selfie doesn't exist?
That's...a healthy start to the Cat Lady lifestyle.

Whiskers is gonna make a break for it someday...

When I sedate cats with Domitor, they make this face ..along with drool and vomiting

Edit: wow, downvoted into oblivion....Domitor is a perfectly safe (within reasons) drug to give to sedate cats!!!

Derpy cat yes
This is priceless!
I dunno, this one seems damn perfect!!!!
I love this so much.
Buhuahahah
I most likely haven't, but I feel like I've seen this person (OP?) before...
This look like it was crafted in a laboratory by a team trying to construct a meme template for maximum reach.
that is kind of how i feel when extroverts try to bring me into an social situation with people i don't know
Awesome,That's so cute!!
wacky
"Guys help this hug is too much for me. Help HELP ME IM GONNA DIE" says the cat as they try so desperately to break free. But it's all for not as the cat accepts its fate. End scene.
You need to immortalise that in a painting!!!!
Blep
Bill the cat.
This kinda looks perfect to me
She looks like Mrs Maisel
Kitler appears to have been hitting the schnapps.
Count Dankula vibes
I'd make the same face if someone choked me out
She's choking the cat.
*Help Hoomannnnnss*
The cat's face tho.. lmao ;P
Blink twice kitty if you’re being held against your will.
Ah yes, the "I'll just slip right out of this wait no shit now I am stuck in a super weird way and I like this even less"-move. A cat-classic.
Oh look it's Bill the cat!
