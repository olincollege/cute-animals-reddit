Carrot has seen it all, and most likely knocked it off the table.
I never knew I needed a cat named carrot. Time to add to the kitty crew
She has a look of an old Samurai who saw everything and who knows everything.
Needs some boots
Kitty looks both wise and adorable. 
I love carrot. 
What a wise carrot

Amazing! Carrot has had a rough couple of days so this is all making my family feel a lot better :) thank you kind internet friends 😊 
Toby Gillis and I send you greetings from the elderly felines club. We met in spring 1998 just after he was born. He's been my partner for 20+ years now.

Cheers!

My childhood cat lived for 20 years and died my last year of high school before leaving as if she was sticking around to watch my back. My parents got her shortly before I was born and apparently would follow me around glaring at anyone who would get close. Subsequently my first word was ‘cat’ which pissed my mom off a bit lol. I miss the fuck out of that cat 
[deleted]
I love how pets get scruffy looking when they get older.

Cue Han Solo quote
Aww my cat is currently 14 and I hope she gets that old.

Carrot is so sweet you should call her Carrot Cake. 

It's hard having an older cat and watching their health decline. My family adopted a rescued barn kitten who we raised as an indoor/outdoor cat in Eastern Ontario. Her health problems started around 17 but she made it to 20 and passed this year. As tough as it is for outdoor kitties, I'm so comforted to know she never missed out on an adventure. Once they've spent a lot of time outside, it feels cruel to restrict them despite the elements and dangers. Carrot is living her best life and no matter where it ends, she's happy you gave her that. <3
I've had such a hard day, seeing sweet Carrot gave me a smile. Thank you. 😊
Tell Carrot that mice still fear her and tell tales of her around the campfire.
Awwwwwwwwww
My neighbors farm cat Milkshakes made it to 19. Lively fucker to the bitter end too
Was hoping my cat would make it to 20 years. She's 15 or 16 right now, not 100% sure, but she has cancer. Pretty big mass in her neck and a lump between the eyes getting bigger. I've been to the vet this week. She's still eating well and seems happy and affectionate but I don't know how much longer this can last.
I would both die and kill for Carrot
I made you this :)

This made me both sad and happy because my cat, who is 19, is working towards her 20th birthday has had some health set backs, I keep demanding she lives until 30 years old but your title 'not many farm cats make it until 18" just got me right in the feels

&#x200B;
He/she doesn't seem to carrot all!
UPDATE: [Carrot says good morning! ](https://imgur.com/a/OnCuNTl) and thanks for all of the love! I just put her photo on here to try and make my mom feel better but Reddit you have outdone yourselves ❤️
My russian grey is also 18 :)
Carrot is the best thing to ever happen to me
UPDATE: thank you all for following Carrot and sending all your love. Unfortunately this morning we had to make the difficult decision to say goodbye. I’m sure wherever she is, they’ve never seen a farm cat quite liked her. ❤️
Tuff ol' farm-cat.
I love you Carrot. 

&#x200B;
Hope Carrot feels better soon!
i love carrot 
I love that cat with every fiber of my being
omg Carrot is a national treasure 
I love this ♥ Congrats to Carrot and may he have many more years and better days ahead.

He reminds me of Tom, an orange farm cat I had in high school, who would go missing for weeks and once a couple of months, and still keep coming home after long journeys. He had lots of battle scars, but man was he a tough ol' guy. I miss him.
Having an 18 year old dog, I know just how special waking up to their love feels, but I also know how much it hurts everyday worrying you're going to lose your best friend any day. My love to Carrot and family!
She can vote in Florida
My old kitty made it to 17, Carrot looks great. Not a day over 12! (Also, she looks like she’s super soft and a total snuggler, I love it when kitties snuggle.)
Get well little warrior! ❤️
I hear he's good for your eyes
Go Carrot! 💜
That cat looks like an elder statesman who just finished writing his memoirs
My old boy is 15 with arthritis 
Bless them when they get up in age 

They're so wise and majestic but also dopey and cute. Here's to him getting well 
Reminds me of my cat Bobze. Lived longer than any other pet. I could pet Carrot forever 😭😭❤❤❤
This Kitty looks like the original farm owner who now gets to watch his kid and grandkid tend to his life's work.
Carrot is wonderful. It looks like he’s spinning some olde timey tales for the kittens. I hope Carrot has a speedy recovery. 
That cat knows how to grow a good sensu bean.
You're lucky.  The old cat on our farm growing up was an asshole.  He'd hang out in the shop, and you could even sit next to him in a chair, but if you touched him, you'd get the claws.
What a great name! 
I can’t be the only one wondering if I should be asking carrot for a snezu bean right?
That is a wise old cat this hits you when you ask stupid questions
Age, name, color?
18, Carrot, Gold
Carrot is adorable! 
Oh my god that’s one of the cutest cats I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen a LOT of cats
Carrot is wise... and Carrot... demands food
Now he can finally vote! 
Carrot is fucking awesome!

Any more photos of Carrot??
Awww carrot! 
Carrot, you made my whole week. We love you! You’re perfect! Pure! A spectacular specimen. 
Looks just like a farm cat that we used to have who was about that age. 

His name was Gym...he was a little large...
Carrot!!!!
Carrot has seen some shit
Surprised this ins't too sad for the mods...
Awwww he had that little farmer stache too. Hug him for us pls.
“The Devil should have killed me when he had the fucking chance.”
I would fucking LOVE to hear his 'back in MY day...' stories 
I would sacrifice my livelihood for carrot 
Thank you for calling your cat Carrot
Does Carrot need some antibiotics? 
pretty carrot
I love you Carrot, and I hope you make it to 19.
She's a beaut
2018 took some great people from us. BUT WE CAN NOT LET IT TAKE CARROT. #healthycarrot
Clean his eye boogies! He lookin a little rough. But damn that is one fantastic cat ya got there I wish I could meet him and pet him =^..^=
Carrot The Wise
It still looks cute. Like Garfield
I love this cat 
I don't want to be dramatic, but I'd fucking die for Carrot
Can we talk about the name Carrot though and how appropriate and cute it is?
Farm cats are underappreciated 
A cat named Carrot???? That is the cutest thing!
He looks like Wilford Brimley. 
Carrot's barn mice body count is legendary.....at least that's the word on the homestead streets.
looks like an old Asian man with infinite wisdom he wishes to share with his student
More Carrot pictures please
We had a 22 year old cat on the farm when I was growing up. She had no name, only the title "Mother of all Cats" from all the litters she had produced , at the time of her death there was somewhere between 30-45 cats on the farm that all were in some way related to her
It's because his name is carrot. This has pleased God and in return God has granted him the blessing of long life. Amen
And now she thinks she's cool. I can tell by the smug look :)
Cutest thing I've seen all day
Carrot!! Keep on keepin’ On!
We just got a farm cat and I love that little guy!! I hope he lives a very long life. ☺️
He is. A Cutie™️.
Tell carrot I love him
I love you, Carrot!
I love barn cats.  Get well soon sweet Carrot!
Such a cute name!
Carrot looks so cuddly 
i love u carrot
I love him and I would DIE for him!!!!!!!!!!! 
What a sweetheart. Give her a kiss from me and my Mowglicub 😽
That's a cute Carrot
I bet Carrot can tell you the meaning of life if you ask him. 
That is the chillest looking cat ever. Hopefully it gets over the last couple days quickly. 
We Care a lot about Carrot <3

She is wise and will pull through!
 Omg, I think Carrot has literally the same b day as me. He is so cute!
Oh look at that fuzzy little old lady! KIIIIITTY!

Edit for correcting the sex of the cat, oops!
He looks wise 
I want and I need to hug Carrot.

NOW!
Aww baby carrot, boop!
Please tell Carrot I love him 
My orange tabby is 14 😘
Carrot 😭 im ded
That's such a CUTE name for a cat. :) 
I lost my families farm cat, Binks, not too long ago. I was away at college and found out at my Thanksgiving dinner. He wasn’t even that old, they thought maybe heart worm. He was such a good cat to me and I’m going to miss him 
My little guy is 1, but he looks like carrot so Im hopeful he will make it to 18!
I love carrot!!!!!
I'm desperately in love with Carrot and I don't know how to tell my family. 
That's the farm-iest looking farm cat I've ever seen. 
That is the wisest cat I’ve ever seen 
He's the kind of cat that can say "No, Mittens, you gotta hittem with the left, not the right" 
We had a cat on our farm that we named Clara. She was gray and white and was wild at first, but through my patience, was able to tame her. Every now and then she'd go missing. She had tons of litters of kittens over the years. She was lean and mean. I often was awoken by her fighting in the yard with newcomers. The last few years I had spent on the farm I had not seen her. I figured she was picked off by an owl or died of old age. But right before I moved, she came back to assure me that she had survived. She was the toughest cat I knew. 18 years of harsh Minnesota winters and a hostile farm environment couldn't kill her. 
What a sweetheart! I hope he gets lots of snuggles <3
I want to give Carrot all the love and a thimble of peanut butter. I love an old fur baby :)
PLEASE TELL CARROT THAT I LOVE HIM
Are we sure that isn't Wilfred Brimley?
This is a cat! 
He's a lovely orange boi
I would die for carrot
Freedom = long life? 
My old farm cat 'Tuffy' made it to 17. He was a dear boy in his old age. Hope your Carrot feels better.
Carrot is so precious. Thanks for keeping her safe and loved for so many years. I hope this winter is easy on her.
We had a cat live to be 18 years old. We took her to the vet and he told us that he had never seen an 18 year old cat before. The oldest he had ever seen was a 15 year old cat.
Once semi adopted a "stray" cat that allowed himself into the doggy door. Eventually got toys and food for him. He came and went as he pleased for about a year. Orange tabby I also called 'carrot' and one day, just before I moved and was considering taking the cat with me, a teenage girl came to my door asking if I have seen an orange tabby, he normally leaves in the morning and comes home at night. But she hadn't seen him in a while. He was on my couch. "You mean this guy?"   "Omg! LJ! " And promptly took him home. LJ is a stupid name anyway. Carrot is much better. Still miss that cat...
This the chillest looking cat I've ever seen. "Eeeeeeeeeeeeey ma'ama, what's goooood?"
I bet he/she’s  caught a few mice in his / her time ! 
Good for Carrot. We’re all so proud of you.
Carrot reminds of Bigwig from Watership Down, for some reason. Maybe it's the grizzled look :)
Carrot , Did a good job!
He looks like he can say "Diabeetus" with some authority.
I know it’s late but here is [how I envisioned](https://imgur.com/a/RXXzZoO)  this cute guy
Imma carrit.
Awww sha his/her little face how cute! Looks happy!
Yeah typically farm cats get used as shooting clays at somepoint
2 snowmen are standing around talking and one goes to the other one “do you smell carrot?”
Carrot is such a cutie and has the cutest name!! Makes my heart swell!! 💖😍💋
Happy birthday Carrot, we’re birthday twins (kinda? I’m 22) I don’t know you, but I love you
Your 18 Carrot is gold.
Carrot has seen some shit.

And I love him/her
I had a kitty I grew up with that made it to 18. His name was yellow kitty and he was my best friend.  My freshman year of college my mom drove three hours to my college to tell me in person that she ran him over.  I'll never forget that day.
That's definitely one farm cat if it's named carrot!
Your cat is older than my girlfriend lol
There's something special about this one. I just wanna cuddle her on a cold Canadian night while drinking hot cocoa. Here's hoping she lives past 20!
My cat just turned 18

btw Congrats buy her a toy or some nice food
he looks mumified..
If only dead birds could talk...
That cat looks 18.
She looks so wise...
I love carrot!! Such a perfect kitty!
There was an old barn cat named Clementine at one of my neighbor's farms. She was a tough bitch, but tame and sweet as heck. She was the first in a long line of fierce cats, and to this day, her line continues. She lived to be about 20 and then she never came back from hunting. The area has fishers and coyotes, so she may have gotten caught by one of them, or maybe she just wandered into the woods to die, but Clem sure proved that not all barn cats die young. 
Damn. That old cat has seen some shit.
I love u carrot
I love you, Carrot. 
I’d let him retire to a nice soft pillow and all the chicken he couldd eat ❤️
Mwah mwah I love you, sweet carrot
Good news !! =DDD Hail to Carrot, the Cat!!! =DDD
I love cats names after food. I had a cat called Toast.
God bless Carrot. What a legend. 
Omg hai carrot
I got a farm cat that somehow is still alive at the ripe old age of 20
I wish you, your mother and carrot all the best. <3
I love carrot
Ca-Carrot!
"Fucking finally. Hey, do me a favor and run down to the shop and pick me up some smokes, Carrot."
Carrot the farm elder and shameowan. he looks wise and all-knowing. 
Bless that good boy
He looks totally fucked tho.
A very soulful looking old man! He’s beautiful!
Please send Carrot my love. What a sweet baby
A friend of mine has an orange tabby that's 23. I hope carrot has many more good years! 
she (or he) even looks like a farmer with that stare
What a handsome cat.Many more years hopefully for you carrot!!
CARROT!!
I had a cat called [Carrot](https://imgur.com/W0RJ3Ov). Also ginger although he had a double name meaning as I named him after Captain Carrot from the Discworld books. Unfortunately he went missing on Halloween during the day before I could take him inside. I was never so distraught over losing a pet. 
Happy Cake day carrot!!
I love you, carrot. 
Wipe those crusties out of carrots eyes
Carrot is beautiful.
Good.
Theres nothing like snuggling an elder cat. 
Its like petting furry wisdom and history (even though their lifes are shorter than ours)
Thanks to you for share with us!!, Carrot had a long live with a family that loves him. Priceless
He’s so crusty and cute I would die for him 
Im no artist so pretty pants but this lil dude is so cute I had to have a go at doodling his lil face. Sending my love to Mr Carrot.  ([doodle](https://imgur.com/a/UK8d63M))
Carrot. I’m in love. 
Carrot! Ugh that name 😭😻❤️
Legally allowed to leave the planet now
i would die for carrot
He looks like he could tell you some shit with those familiar looking nose scars. We had to put ours down after a bad scrape with a wild raccoon. She made it to 15 and was otherwise healthy. 
Dat nose!
101k sheesh
My gf's moms cat is 23y.o. Never been more scared when i heard her scream at night
Happy happy bday
My friend's made it to 19 this year before having to be put down. Hopefully Carrot goes even further!
Not to be dramatic, but I would DIE for Carrot 
Carrot looks wise beyond years!
Awesome 
Carrot looks like a Winnie the Pooh character 
Aw he’s all scraggly waggly...my cat is 15 and she’s starting to look that way too...
My current cat is 16 and spry as ever, let’s hope she does as well as carrot here 
I can sense that he a thicc kitty. String from many years of work.
Omg he's such a little nugget 💗
Carrot looks like such a sage, like a miniature Buddha covered in fur.
Carrot! What a sweet name!
Good boy Carrot!!!
Beautiful cat named Carrot!
Her diet consisted of her name. Thus the good eyesight.
I love you carrot
Aww Carrot 🥰🥰🥰
My cat lived until 21
She doesn’t seem to give a shit to anything ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Aww, Carrot is so sweet!
Awesome name
I love this lil cat ☺️
Awwww his name is purrrfect😻😻😻😻
What a good name for a cat. 
Hahahaha why does carrot look like a babushka I love this!
Queen Carrot presides over her farm with a firm paw.  Mousies beware!
What a cutie!
This cat totally looks like it lives on a farm and speaks with a southern accent 
My cat is almost 20! Hoping he makes it another year. 
Precious
carrot i love you you are doing great 
I love this dude.
There’s a cat at the corner of my block that’s quite friendly with me— I visit him quite often when he’s outside. I’ve named him Pickles (after the cat from Neko Atsume, to which he looks similar.) Apparently his name is Pepe—not too far off— and he’s 17. Which is older than my sister. Definitely a shocker!
Looking sweet, Carrot!
What a beautiful specimen 
[removed]
She looks like she’s so done with your shit
Get er done carrot!
You’re cat looks like that critter from Caddy-shack lol 
That face is the last thing thousands of mice saw. Good work Carrot. 
I love farm cats the most. I have two mousers. If a farm cat loves you, it's true love. Farm cats don't get regular food (because theyre supposed to kill their food. Don't worry, we feed ours in the winter and if they beg. If they beg then they haven't found prey lately), and usually spend their days outdoors. They're not housecats that love you because you're the food lady. 
Carrot looks like she's done with your shit 
My cat made it to 21 before quietly passing away in her sleep.
Unpopular opinion: older pets are so much cuter than younger pets
I love him immensely 
Not to be dramatic, but I would die for Carrot
HES SO FUCKING CUTE
I’ve always wanted a pupper named Carrot!!!!! But I love this kitty Carrot!
Yes!!! My 11.5 year old cat is named Bananas!!
The stories he could tell!
I had to re-create an account, because I forgot my old one, just to post that I too once had a cat named Carrot! Best cat ever😔
How dignified!
I wish we all never die, including the animals. 
I love farm/barn cats, Carrot has probably slayed close to 1000 mice in her years
And now she thinks she's cool. I can tell by the smug look :)
What a sweetie! To many more years of love and happiness. :)
Go on Carrot! 
Logged in just to upvote this sweet kitty <3
Sweet boi
you GO, Carrot!
This cat has killed many a rodent
That's gold.. 18 carat gold 😎 
I love Carrot. I hate myself.
He’s so adorable!
Stay strong & much love from the other side of the globe, Carrot. 
What a beautiful bastard 
That looks like Arthur Morgan as a cat 
This made my day)
Give Carrot a big kiss on the nose.
He looks wise
Are you sure he's alive??!? 
Carrot has this wise look. Just like Confucius...

Those who hesitate...
Long live Carrot!
My cat was 20
Orange farm cats are the best, fight me.
Carrot looks very suspicious 
farm cats live the longest in my experience 
Congrats Carrot. Keep going
Carrot is definitely stoned right now.
Congratulations Carrot
Aww.
I love you Carrot
He/she looks like a withered old man. So cute!! 
Aww she reminds me of a cat I had when I was a kid, who was an outdoor city cat, who we had to leave with neighbours when we moved to the US. We thought it would only be for a few months, but we ended up staying and the neighbours went on vacation with their cat and ours. Sardine ended up loving it so much that she stayed with the owners of the place, and became an outdoor country cat (straw hat and all). She's still alive, unlike our other cat, Tartine, who had some sort of liver failure a few years ago and died in his sleep.

Anywho, Carrot is adorable!! What a cutie patootie lady!!
Carrot looks like a damn savage.  You go Carrot!
Feel better soon Carrot and happy holidays Carrot family!
Time for a well earned retirement to the couch. 
carrot deserves a can of tuna for his/her 18th
I think I am in love. 
CARROT
Looks so fluffy and beautiful.  :3
He looks like a wise grandpa!
Wait till she's 24 Carrot, then she'll be even more precious
My farm cat passed away last year at 17.

Cherish Carrot with all your heart.
Carrot is the best name!!! I love it
Carrot definitely has a chair as an elder on a council of wise cats. I can see this picture hung in the Hall of Legendary cats.
Your cat is immortalised by this post and in my phone. Be proud of yourself. I am. Of you, of course, not of myself, I suck, but you're cool.
tell carrot I love him
We had an old mama cat (we spay all but one so we can keep a handle on the litters), we called her orangey. We had her euthanized last year at the ripe old age of 16. That’s old af for a farm cat. She was a great mouser and raised litters of great mousers. She was a friendly old girl and when it looked like she was through, we did the kind thing instead of letting her just disappear to suffer and die alone. RIP, baby, you did good.
I love this but he does look like hes begging for death in this picture
^kill ^me ^meow
Did you get Carrot cake?
Age is just a number and something this good cat doesn't Carrot all about.
More like /r/gaww
He’s really a dwarf. 
I showed this cat to my cats (Josh and Flare) Josh rolled over so i gave him belly rubs and Flare put his paw on my phone (Flare is orange and looks just like carrot so im assuming he was confused)
She is looking like she know everything her eyes looking so cunning.
Is there some point in time when Carrot gets brought inside a home to retire in comfort? Or are barn cats really more comfortable outside even in something like a Canadian winter?
granpa cat
I've been inspired to push through finals week. If Carrot can push through 18 years, I can last a week
my cat is 22 :)
Congrats Carrot! Orange cats are the best. I have 2, they are 2 and 12. I hope they live as long as this pretty kitteh! 
Cutest cat in the game 
Happy birthday carrot!
Omg carrot I love her 😭😭😭
He is adorable
Boss
Wizened old cat. I will make him a Tabaxi NPC in my D&D game. He will be guarding a sacred barn.
Our barn cat, Duke, is 17! It’s so much more impressive since they’re outdoor farm cats, and most people don’t even realize it
Many hugs for Carrot!
Happy bday Carrot!!
Carrot the ginger cousin to korin.
He looks like the old dad from Walker Texas Ranger.
Carrot
76 years old
Does he still do any farm cat stuff or does he stay inside the house all the time now?
That’s so awesome. My fiance had a cat for a little over 20 years. His name was Junior and he was the coolest grumpy cat there was. 
Yep my cat is a farm cat and she just turned 19!
Mine is an orange tabby who turns 19 in January. He's a problem and has no chill, and all sorts of old man energy, but I forgot what life was like without him. I'll probably miss the shit streaks on my carpet when he's gone.
Carrot is an absolute treasure. I hope he’s on the mend soon!
Aw, love the name and love the adorable cat!
nice pic
I love a farm animal. The good ones are fiercely independent, yet loving and respectful of humans. The ability for two different animals to observe what each other are daily, but still find and enjoy a cross species bond is awesome. 
Good carrot! 
Carrot is so cute lol 
She’s so fuckin cute.
That cat looks like he sits on a porch dispensing sage advice. 
I thought at first that the title said "how many farm cats is it gonna take to get 18 carrot hats".
He looks so content 😻 awwww such a sweet looking little boy/girl(?)
What a sweetie. 
The only carrot I like (: 
I love carrot. What a sweet face!
Wow!!! What an amazing cat!!! Carrot is amazing. Ps that doodle would make a great tattoo as well 
Damn that looks really similar to my old farm cat that died just a couple of days before turning 18. My mom got him for a dollar before I was born. And we instantly became best friends.
Wow, he's really cute.. But what's a farm cat? 
This is too pure. And rest in peace for the other cats.
Only in the farms that are not into what I've seen in the news. 
Carrot looks like a really sweet cat. My grandparents had an orange tabby cat which was also really sweet but constantly weighed over 20 lbs. It was fat, but sweet!
Do farm kitties have short lives? :(
HIM NAME CARROT!!!
I'll take18 Carrot gold please
She definitely has the look of a surly, old farmer.
I had an orange tabby, lived to about 19. She was the sweetest cat I owned, about 8 years later I found one at the local rescue to bring home.

Carrot's an adorable old cat. :)
cutie looks like yoda
> I've seen things kitten that you wouldn't believe.... Wait who are you
CARROT!!!
Captain Carrot.  He is the king of the Farm.

He might seem like he is a lowly rat catcher.  But the animals know that he is the true and rightful king.


He just prefers to be catching rats.
Donate 3$ to wikipedia
That isnt a carrot, its a cat.
Carrot looks like a good kitty. 10/10 would pet.
Carrot is a cool name 
My farm cat made it to 20. She sadly passed this spring.
I love the name
Aww Carrot. <3
I love carrot so much ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Carrot is so good
Cute Carrot!!
Carrot looks faded 
Good job to Carrot for being a tough ol guy. Farm cats have it rough, it's a hard knock life for them. I was going to adopt a kitten from my parents farm a few months ago but I think it got eaten by a coyote or something :(  poor little guy
Such a sweet face!! My girl is 17, an indoor girl. Your Carrot has had a more challenging life on the farm, here's to many more years!!
awwwww
I bet that old feller could tell you some stories about back in his day. 
Carrot!!!!
Is that a farm mouse peeking out of Carrots nose?
Carrot looks like a cat who would be wearing a sweater, while sitting next to a homeless guy playing a Casio keyboard.
Still look adorable 
Aw, such a precious lil cat 🐱 
Carrot is perfect 
Thank you kind internet friend! 
Give Carrot some snuggles for me, please. He is such a good lil orange boy.
Awesome
Why don't many farm cats make it?  Predators?  Disease is from livestock?
his name is carrot❤️😭
What a handsome kitty :) 
He needs your help decrusting.
Carrot was alive before 9/11 or YouTube or the iPhone. That's incredible! Great job Carrot!
I am deffinately not a cat person, but carrot looks so yummy yummy😅 I would give scratchies gently to this legend

Mee the real world Garfield
"hah, you didn't expect that "

Great name!
Carrot is older than me
My friends bought a new barn last year, and the old owners left the barn cats behind. One kitten was named carrot stick, carrot for short :)
Yoda Carrot. 
Awewwwwwwww carrot 😍
That cat has seen some shit.
Not a cat person but I think I love Carrot 
I had a beautiful orange girl named Carrottop who also lived to be 18. Something in them carrot genes. 
I love Carrot! What a special angel you have. All animals love, love too!!
"Jon, give me my *fucking* lasagna."
That cat has seen some shit. 
Aww, I love senior animals and Carrot is so sweet!

Btw, the name made me laugh in a good way. :)
You mention Carrot has had a rough few days...what's wrong with Carrot? :-( 
He looks like he has much wisdom.

Carrot is gold!
My 18 year old cat died last week :(
I bet Carrot smokes a corn cob pipe
Monday syndrome 😂
I’m sure Carrot is responsible for a lot of smiles! 
We had a sweet barn cat named Tom that lived to be 20-21.
Happy birthday Carrot 😘
That’s a nice name.
Carrot is so good!!! 
ya ever just get tired of living? 
My brain told me that was a noose around the cat's neck and I freaked the fuck out for a second. 
Can you show your cat this comic series please?

I think she would like it. Starring another ginger cat named Carrot.
Scully made it until 19. She died peacefully 3 years ago.

I still miss her, she was a great friend.

I hope Carrot has had a great cat life.
Knowing something that I don't want to happen that is guaranteed is sad.
Look at that old guy. So cute!
awww gorgeous girl! long live carrot 
I love you, Carrot!
Not many farm animals ever make it to even one years old.
My cat is almost 20, and he seems more healthy than my other 2 years old cat LOL
Look everywhere. Research suggests this is part of a #Russian propaganda campaign.

The orange ones are the best....
That’s a bad ass cat. 
I hope carrot is alright, I saw you mentioned it’s been a rough couple days. What a cute kitty. I love Carrot!!!
very cool
 He's 18? Good on you lad, wanna beer?
Give carrot a drink now, legal age celebration 
Carrot is precious and perfect. I love her so much.

You're giving her a good life filled with love. Good on you.
As a cat person, it warms me to see kitties look as floof as they do at such an “old age” my second cat ever is 14, she’s lost weight, but still maintaines the ferocity she had when she was younger....as someone who treats scratches and bites daily
My God, a life this cat led.  Growing up on a working cattle ranch, I didn’t realize that other people had pets with no jobs. 
She's beautiful
Your little dirty nose is so cute, Carrot ❤️🐈🥕
I love you carrot 
I love you Carrot and your giant soft orange face. 
This goodness is what the internet is for
You are a good person. 
I have a cat that just turned 21, her name is Sinatra, and she will still try to fight other cats 
😭❤️ thank you for sharing this beautiful angel with us. hurts my heart to hear shes had a rough few days. i have had farm cats too they have a special place in my heart. best wishes to you and your family.
Give Carrot a hug.. so sweet
Give Carrot our collective pats. They've earned them.   
A cat living 18 years is an achievement in itself, but an outdoor farm cat doing that is legitimately impressive.
Yeah buddy!
I love u carrot 
I’d like to farm cats too.
Yay for Carrot!!!
I love the name!
Carrot is ADORABLE. Thanks OP for making me smile.
Why is he called carrot? 🤔







/s
I will name my son Carrot in his honor 
Carrot has seen some things
“You come to me, on the day of my daughter’s wedding... (and some other words)”
This guy looks like he’s telling an interesting anecdote, he needs a monocle and a glass of fine brandy. 
Happy birthday, Carrot!! Xx
That's the look on the face of somebody who's seen what you did and disapproves but still loves you
Such a sweat baby! That face is adorable!
"Sit by the fire young one and I will teach you the ways of Mortal Kombat"
Real life Garfield. 
She looks so wise. I love Carrot 
Carrot is cute
I love Carrot. 
Happy Birthday, Carrot! Time to submit that driving license application.
Aww she's as old as me! Imagine all the things she have went through and experienced! Long live, Carrot! P.S. Also a cat lover here. A total of  5 cats I take care right now! <3 
That soulless being would eat your corpse without hesitation.

Its pure fluffy murder.
Yay Carrot!
Is wise and handsome old maow 
Happy birthday Carrot! 
Carrot is an outstanding name for a cat 
You sure?
Carrot is wonderful!!!!❤️❤️
I remember our first farm cats happy and angry, they were the best two cat you could ask for. Happy died when I was little, you see my Mum loves chooks and we required a lot of food and this in turn attracted mice and snakes. Happy would have been two years old when it killed a brown snake that was living by the chook food that my mum found, that cat loved my mum and probably saved her life. Happy died shortly after since the closest vet was an hour away and she didn’t make it. 
Angry only passed away last year at age of 16 and it took awhile to find him because he went down the paddock to die so we couldn’t find him, in his 16 years however he raised four puppies and one parrot named polpol. This post made me miss the buggers and we certainly didn’t deserve their love
And he looks so tired of his owners shit
Aw what a cute bby. Bless Carrot!!!! 
Carrot is such a cute name it hurts. 
Wow . The love your cat projects to you is amazing 
Wow. You guys still surprise me.
That is the wisest looking cat I’ve ever seen
I like carrot
Farm cats>purebreed cats tbh.
It looks like if it could talk it would be saying -hossenfeffer- here.
I love you Carrot. 
Happy birthday Carrot Kitty!🍰🥕🐱💚
Hope Carrot feels better soon! <3
Legend says she caught the red dot
Carrot has been in the shit.
Carrot has eye boogies ☺️
Looks like a real sweetheart. I'm glad you've gotten so many years together. 
Please, he has ‘mouse murderer’ written ALL OVER HIS FACE.

Tough old buzzard 
She looks like a kitten
She's so cute
Or he idk 
It would be nice to see her old pics ...please share her old pics
This cat is 2 years younger than me😶😶😶
I miss my Mr. Kitty. He was old and awesome, had him 15 years. Carrot looks like a badass :) 
God bless 
What a beautiful baby
Carrot! That is the most adorable name I've ever heard!
What an amazing looking cat!!
My cat Raggy made it to about 18-20 
Please tell Carrot I love him/her
my cat turns 23 next year 
We have an 18ish year old farm cat named jo. She goes away for a month or so then comes home for a week and repeats lol. She's aggressively affectionate lmao. If you stop patting her she will bite until you start again haha
that a lot of upvotes

you could say


its 18 Carrot gold


Gorgeous kitty cat
Aw...she is super cute ♡ 
What a sweetheart! I'm the daughter of a crazy cat lady and my dad's nickname is Carrot (he's a redhead) aaaaand I and the proud cat mama of an orange girl kitty named Pumpkin LOL!! I don't know what all that has to do with your adorable kitty post, I'm just a synchronicity warrior haha!! Best wishes to you and Carrot and all of your family!! Life must be good on the farm!! 
Can she see in the dark?
If current old man Bob Dylan was a cat, he'd be Carrot.
I love carrot. 
Beautiful old fella
Please do an update on Carrot later, she is really cute and pudgy. Give her a big hug for me (:
Everything best for Carrot!!! I'm very happy that she is 18. But on the other hand this picture hit me very hard... I've read that she is 90% deaf and blind - this is so sad... Time is a bitch. Someone remove onions from my eyes.
We had a farm cat get into her early 20s! The farm keeps them young.
Born in 2000!

Jus like me yay
Yay carrot
My family in Seattle, WA had an indoor/outdoor orange tabby named Carrot! Your lovely lady cat is gorgeous and is sure to many more lives in her. Our guy jumped off of the roof of the car going 35mph (eeeek ki?), abandoned us to add suspense and another day to our family beach vacation on the Oregon coast and only left us when he turned 18. Sending you all the bunts, purrs and cuddles to close 2018. 🐱🐾
If a grumpy old farmer was a cat, carrot would be it.
My baby had a rough night
Oh you Americans @ Canajans... "... not to be sentimental but i would die for Carrot...".
Just a Cat, people... been around a long time and loved by the family thats all... seen seasons come and go, the ebb and flow, pondered all the big questions... probably has the answers and now in the twi... the twilight (sorry something in my eye just now... )
Cutie
Carrot is the bomb.

I had a black cat named Sam growing up that lived until he was 22. He had no teeth and no claws but still managed to run the neighbourhood, even when he was 21. 
Powerful creature
She looks like a tan Yoda
Carrot! I love that name!
Not many farm carrots make it to 18, but Cat has
He looks like he has many stories to tell
hahaha I’m fucking crying. 
dang i wanna hug this cat so bad
What a good looking lass. 
Carrot does not look very fucking pleased to have made it that far tbh.
You are looking at Carrot, lord of the yard, first of his name, killer of mice, cuddler of mom and dad, acceptor of tooshie scritches, protector of the realm. 
Congrats to ol’Carrot. Farm cats have an important job and such swagger. Thank you for sharing her with us. 💖
One-Carrot. That name is SO adorable for an orange tabby, especially a carrot-orange-farm-cat-tabby. Two-I want to smooch that sweet face! 
I love carrot!  Bless it's soul :)

Hi not to be dramatic but I would die for Carrot. 
He even looks like a cute ball of hay
I love him! Sweet Carrot kitten. 
Aww so cute 
\>that 18 year old cat boomer who still plays with a yarn ball
„Hey lets name our cat carrot“
Our Scooter just turned two weeks ago. Long live Carrot!
she looks like she has eaten many chickens in her 18 yrs
I love you Carrot! 
Is that karin 
So wise. 
Carrot is a very cute name
I have two cats, Zucchini and Green Bean; if I got another pet. I always thought that I'd name them Carrot.
