Goldens: not satisfied unless they're carrying something in their mouths
2 goldens and a wine fridge. What HGTV heaven is this?
If you have a dog then you're guaranteed love
Other dog is like "2 dogs! All you need is love and 2 dogs!"
So cute but I'd feel bad telling the doge I don't need the pillow 
I believe him, yo. I don't know why, but I do.
All I need is to somehow get rid of my allergies towards dogs and then get one
So h*cking cute
That's redundant and you know it, OP. Dogs ARE love.
And also apparently wine helps too... based on the wine cooler on the left.
Hey, we have that same pillow!

(Dog on right) stop hogging the photo burt, he has two of us thats twice the lo-
Or two dogs!  üòç
Best video I have seen on the internet in weeks. Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
It‚Äôs basically the same thing. 
dog = love
All you need is the dog tbh 
;
"Hey! Next time you leave the house I'm going to destroy this! Just wanted to let you know!"
What is it about goldens.  They are just the most loving dogs. I find that they are always happy.
2 dogs = twice the happiness
Awful title. 
Put an egg in it's mouth
If this was a cat, she'd be sleeping on top of the pillow, safe in her knowledge that she's the supreme being, and that she only needs you to provide a quick meal and head scratches. 
All you need is love. Dog = love.

All you need is dog?
it's too much trouble to have a pet dog, time and again I tell myself.

time and again, golden retriever gifs pull me back in and convince me it will be worth it
And you most certainly don't need no schmackos, hand em over.
I wonder how many looking at the pic will feel that the msg is meant **for them** actually..
Biased 
If you have a dog that tends to bark when excited teach it to get a pillow before it goes up to the person like this one
As a cat person, I can‚Äôt disagree with this statement. 
Dogs are love
u/wf2968 well i have one out of the two 
2 doggos = twice the love
[Dog is love](https://imgur.com/a/o0mbd) - Rev. Ruff
...and that wine chiller.
Dog owners know this :)
I have this pillow.
What‚Äôs the difference? 
Such good boys 
A labs mouth is so soft you can put a pillow in it.
Isn't that the same thing?
But you have two!
I ain't got nothing then.
Or two
Can confirm, have double the love.
Love and shitloads of grilled meat. YeeehAaaaaa
I‚Äôll take two thanks
Love=Dog
‚ÄúAll you need is love and A dog.‚Äù *wink*
And a pillow... according to dog 
He's the complete package 
All you need is the love of a dog. 
I hate loud barking. 
But dogs ARE love, albeit in a rather slobbery messy form but who cares...love is love. 
Seems suspicious - I wouldn't trust either one of those slippery droolers.
my day is made
Can confirm... Got a doggo and I'm happy 
Of course they're going to promote dog, they're dogs.  Good dogs.
Thant‚Äôs Fansu and Bodhi who live in Hong Kong
I disagree. All you need is love and 2 dogs!
[This is all I need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZTdqh-a0tU).
That wine fridge doesnt hurt either lol
accurate
Dogs are the best! üòÜ
Sweet
What happened if i have 2 dogs?
Said the guy with a wine fridge
Sounds true to me!
Man I love golden retrievers...
This made my day! My mom has been puppy sitting my husker due to severe separation anxiety and a hectic work schedule for me this past week. He‚Äôs recently been separated from his other doggy buddy and isn‚Äôt taking it well. He needs a friend to help keep him in check. (Checking in to fostering) 
I get to pick him up tonight, and I‚Äôm so freaking excited! It‚Äôs only been 4 days, but I miss the shit out of that dude. 
I feel like if my beagle could choose one it would say ‚ÄúAll you need is....to drop more food‚Äù
Spoiler, he ripped all the stuffing out after this
Trying to find a flaw in this argument... failing miserably.  
I ask myself hoe long it take to bite into it
Where can I get that pillow? 
Where can I get this pillow?!?
Puppies peddlin propoganda
That's it! Scott! Get the wallet, we're adopting a dog!
Me applying for a job
.....or two!! :D
Truth!
That's definitely legit. If there is one thing that could only be legit. that would be that!
You have TWO dogs. You're living in excess. 
Proof we don't deserve dogs
*All you need is a dog*
That actually is legit. 
‚ÄúWouldja move...Brody... I‚Äôm trying to show her the damn pillow‚Äù
....
‚ÄúThink she read It?‚Äù
Cats are also essential
All you need it love... And a sweet wine rack.
I want buy one .. what will i do to get nice one ?!
But dog is love.
*A*?
That pillow clearly states "A" dog, not two dogs.

That dog is trying to send it's owner a message.
That's a very redundant statement 
I can't hear this gif but I guarantee this dog barked a few times with the pillow in their mouth. My golden loves to make a little bark with her mouth full of socks, shirts, pillows, toys, anything really. 
Next target : MUST GET DOGG!
Yet I lack both.
Dogs *** how rude lol. 
This should have been what the Beatles song was called
Nobody *needs* a dog.
A wine cooler helps too. 
You just made me smile. Thanks. 
Turer words have never been nommed 
I got the love! Wife and daughter are amazing... But my dog is evil :( :(
Or two!
Does not bode well for the second dog...
And a super expensive wine fridge in ur kitchen
Always trust a golden boi
take the dang pillow already!
why not two instead?
I'll take the love. Not the Animal. Do I win this game now?
This makes me smile... I just lost my puppy today for 10 years and makes me smile... thank you very much OP
What's with this lame title?
Can i have them both?
Aww. Please pan over to the other doggo too!
A dog is a man's best friend, right?
"A dog, Sharon. 'A' dog. Singular."

-- Dog with pillow
But 2 is better 
Checks out
Theyre trying to brainwash us and this is them presenting their propaganda. Soon dogs will rule the world!
Kinda need a car to transport that dog to the park 
i'm finally moving to my own house... i think the first thing im going to do is adopt a dog. 
Wine mom
Seems redundant.
So all you need is a dog.
... 0-2 ain't bad.

*sigh*
So... all you need is a dog?
‚ÄúHappiness is a dog to adore you and a cat to ignore you.‚Äù
Dat's the same thing tho...
Certified good boi
He reaaaalllly wants to chew it...
Love...dog...What's the difference? All you need is dog (woof woof woof woof woof woof) all you need is dog (etc...)...
And with dog comes love
and a few dogs*
The other one needs a pillow that says ‚Äú‚Ä¶or two‚Äù.
and a new pillow 
I see who‚Äôs the favorite one!! 
All you need is a dog, a dog comes with love
Isn't that the same thing?
And if you don‚Äôt have love at leasts you have a second dog
... and to wash that pillow
Owning dog = House = Lots of money = Rich 

Shit you‚Äôre right love and money are the only things we need
I have a beagle, so I'm 51% there.
Oh my god this is so much like my dog, whenever someone comes home he'd run upstairs to grab a plushie and run all the way back downstairs and show you it, but don't try to take it or he'll be upset xD
I would settle just for the dog
I have neither
I think he's trying to tell you something.
Golden‚Äôs have to be in my top five favorite dogs. 
I lost my Golden a year ago, but these types of posts make me smile the most :)
My doge
All I need is a golden puppy! I miss the two I had before!
All these posts of goldens/labs on reddit recently have made me miss my Golden Girl :'(
10/10 would believe the doggo
this dog is so nice..i like you ..you are lovely..
He can‚Äôt really be trusted, because he‚Äôs a dog, and the message is conspicuously pro-dog. There‚Äôs a high degree of bias in him highlighting this message. Also, dogs can‚Äôt read, making this all the more suspicious.
**YES** Really legit. I really miss having a dog :")
People really don't know how to use this phrase.
Truth, love and woofers is all you need
This looks like the one that was yawning in bed a few days ago
"Out the way, this is my camera time"
This is redundant
But there‚Äôs two....
And...multiple dogs.
Golden retriever on aww doing normal dog stuff? To my front page! I guess! 
Redundant statement mrite
Dogs are love.
that way the mouth is shaped when its mouth is full is absolutely adorable 
I have neither :(
All love you and need a is dog
So, all you need is dog
Like seriously, 101% true loyalty on point.
Dogs are a bunch of love wrapped in fur.
meh, you can go without love.
Woosh tail 
I need myself a lab
this is so cute <3
Too bad you have two
OP:

‚òëÔ∏è Love

‚òëÔ∏è Dog

‚ûñ Good Title
ALL DAY!
/r/haildogporate
Aren't those like the same thing?
They‚Äôre the same thing. 
What's the difference? 
All I want to do today is hug this dog
Dogs ARE love
We don't deserve doggos
üé∂All I need is you, a little luck, and a couple dogsüé∂
Are Goldens good with cats?

I would like to get a dog one day but I've also got two cats
I have 2 rescue puppers, relatively smol. They are the loves of my life (along with my wifey of course) 

But I REAALLY want a Golden Retriever. help. 
I'm sure that if you can get the dog the love comes naturally. At least from the dog.
That seems somewhat tautological... but I'll allow it.
I have no love and have a cat. I think I'm doing it wrong 
101% legit
Where do I sign?
Stupid title
Definitely true. Good boy
Aw this made me miss my dog 
and a new pillow
The cutest floofs.
***Dog = Love***
What vvvvv good puppy dogs!
That's redundant.
This is redundant. 
BUP BA DA DA DAAAAAA
All you need is a dog, they bring the love with them.
What about your spouse? 
... and dogecoin?
....Or 2 dogs 
Which one is love and which one is the dog
TRICK QUESTION, love IS dog.
Ebola
And I have neither :(

I should get a dog
Shelters across America should have these pillows and just put digs out front holding them as advertising. 
He's subtly telling you something ".. *a* dog" not dogs. There's some kind of rivalry there
Yup. These dogs knows whats up.
Dumb caption 
Hey, please give credit to the Original owner from Instagram where this was taken. 
Tautology
Too cute to be mad
WHAT A SWEET BABY
Fanxiu and Bodhi! How about you tag the Instagram user you ripped this from, OP?
"All you need is love and a dog "

is redundant
Statement is redundant. Dog is just a synonym for Love.
Isn‚Äôt the saying on the pillow redundant? 
Dog = Love
boof boof
My golden retriever endorses this post 100%.
So much yes in this post.  It made me miss my old dog so much.
All you need is love... and a digitally controlled wine refrigerator built into your custom kitchen.
I'm melting inside
Just divorced and she got our golden - definitely not awww. 
All you need is love, food, a dog and a cat.
Love is a dog.
Truth have been spoken 
A good doggo
Same thing
Other side of pillow "And no cat."
And a wine fridge apparently üò∂
Holy mother of Jesus H. Christ. That‚Äôs the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. That good boy better have gotten some pets. 
Seems redundant; a dog is love.
Seems tautological. We all know dogs are love made flesh.
Cute dog
I love Golden Retrievers!
Ypu don't even need love when you have two dogs 
Same thing. 
Is that an oven? hmmm...
Probably some dog food to feed the dogs would help. 
Or two

That pillow is redundant. Dogs are love on 4 legs
That is too cute! ‚ô•Ô∏èü§ó
@ bzgolden on insta. That's Bohdi with the pillow and Fansu
Puppaganda at it's finest.
The op will probably not get this, but by chance is the OP from pendleton Oregon. 
And a wine fridge. 
Had to put down my yellow lab yesterday.. this is tough :/
Much cheaper than a significant other
Well, I'm all set then!
Or two. I used to wake up from a nap in the recliner covered with dog toys lovingly placed there by my golden Sinbad. 
All I ever see when people post these, is a person with a phone standing there pointing it at their pet, ehile the pet must be like: what the fuck are they doing? Love on me...
I don't have either of those things :(
What's the difference? 
Any beatles fans here?
Golden retrievers are the best dogs and I will fight anyone who says differently.
So what that pillow says is actually you just need a dog.
It's a redundant statement because dogs are the physical embodiment of love
I wanna eat that dog because it's so precious 
wErE aRe mY TrEaTs?
This is like saying "Water is wet."
You cannot argue with a ‡∞ú‡±ç‡∞û‚Äå‡∞æ dog
But a good dog, like a golden retriever. 

You‚Äôre not going to be any better off if you get like a shit bull or something. 
this is disgusting i hate dogs
If a human being or your dog were hanging off a cliff which would you choose to save?

You are what's wrong with our society, and why we have people shooting up schools. Moral relativism and a loss of love for our fellow man.
