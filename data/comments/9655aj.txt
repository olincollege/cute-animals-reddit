My parents’ husky took on the role of referee for the cats. Whenever she hears growling or hissing she runs over and breaks it up. 
“Come on man. He’s not worth it, you’re drunk. Let’s go.”
"Hold me back hold me back!"

"Ok." 
"I'm gonna kick yer ass!"

"Nope, nope. We'll have none of that."
Just ruined Mitten’s street cred. Thanks Mom.
I love the dog in the background minding his own damn business 😂
I got myself a Basset Hound when I left my parents home, previously I had a German shepherd which I trained in my teens. Their character is quite different, one being a Hound and the other a Shepherd. On holidays at my parent's I took them both on a hike. 

The basset, as per usual tries to go in front tracking small prey ,which he does sometimes, even though I don't hunt, and he just stands there looking at the rabbit/mice when eventually he gets one out of hiding. That day he went and ran way too far. 

So I told my long-haired German Shepherd to go fetch him, he starts running and cuts right in front of the Basset's way looking at him. The small-legged Basset stops, looks at him and then tries to pass under the shepherd's watch, the shepherd barks at him and then the Basset comes running back to me. 

From then on, everytime the Basset would look like he would get away from near me,  the German Shepherd would run in front of him and bring him back.

Genetics and instincts are something amazing. 
This is why Golden’s are too pure for this world. 
No people? Is this some post apocalyptic future where dogs and cats have taken over the planet and human's have perished?

I love how the cat doesn’t put up a fight as he’s carted back. Like this is definitely not the first time
[deleted]
It's funny how much cats fight versus how much dogs fight. Our dog brawled probably one or two times in his lifetime. Our cat is surprisingly still alive with how much scars he's got. 

Village cats are hardcore.
When your drunk friend wants to start a fight.

Don't talk to strangers!
"it's not worth it bro"
Cat: “Aw, come on, man!!  I can take this guy!”

Dog: “Nope, he’s gonna whoop your ass just like last time.”

Cat: But...

Dog: Nope.

Cat:  “You better be glad he’s here! I’d..,”

Dog: Nope.

Cat: “@$&##%+&$!!!”

Dog: “Shut up. Remember, I can whoop your ass too.”
That's wonderfully adorable
A Golden, retrieval.
This is right up there with the gorilla that hates the rain
Perfect title OP! This made me chuckle audibly in a quiet cafe, I know of no greater praise than that. 
This is hands down the cutest thing I’ve ever seen on reddit. I challenge anyone to find something more adorable 
Now that’s a golden version of retrieving 
I love how the cat is just quietly hanging there like "mooooom, I wasn't really gonna hit him"
Older brothers rule
Actually this is in reverse. He’s not as good as the video makes him out to be.
That is toooo precious.
First video in the morning. This is definitely the best way to wake up. 
Goldens are the peace keepers of the animal world.
This is the equivalent to your mother screaming at you to GIT BACK ON THIS STOOP (if you grew up in the 80’s and in a city)

This is amazing. Makes me very happy. Source video pls
Loose, collar-less dogs are loving friends with a vidcious cat which is odd. It looks like the pup on the steps is talking smack to the other cat.
Isle of Dogs was a great movie. 
That cat just lost every shred of dignity he ever owned. Poor dear. 
GO HOME YOU'RE DRUNK!
“Just let me go at him once!”

May be he is acting up all because his brothers are Dawgs
Cat: You lucky I'm on probation.
Cat: "Mess with mittens, get these MITTE-"

Dog:"nope"
I always find cats with leashes weird
There's a cat in the background about to yell 'Worldstar!'
Is this filmer the guy who documents the "dog gangs of New York"?
I feel bad for a cat. Gotta be emberrasing for him.
I have a lab and she’s super smart and I think I’ll always have labs...BUT Goldens seem to have this human-like ability to process information and react in the most perceptive, empathetic, and reasonable way.
It’s weird how advanced they are in terms of emotion. Weird in the best way.
How embarrassing. 
My Pomeranian is always the cat referee. We don't have a lot of fighting, but our one permanent cat is deaf and blind. Our dog is very protective of him. He is so wary when our fosters meet the cat and frequently breaks up play time.

We also currently have a litter of kittens. Poor dog is so stressed out about keeping them safe.

Dogs are even a cat's best friend ..... 
Mittens is a rebel who doesn't play by your rules but does the dogs 
I like the of the other doggo sitting on the stairs wondering about stuff.
Such a good boy
I love how gently the golden grabs the leash and then just drags him up the stairs hahaha
When your drunk friend keeps trying to fight people at the bar.
Do people actually walk cats? I’ve been around dogs my whole life and never actually seen a cat on a leash out in public. 
“What the hell, Walter?!”
Love this, I totally send my dog outside when my cat needs back up. 
Dogs are so wonderful sometimes. <3
Retrievers gon' retrieve
Poor cat. You know the other cat was laughing his ass off.
The friend who always gets into fights, The friend who stops the fights and the friend who sits back and watches the whole thing while laughing.

Just a typical night out.
Cute cat :3

Yo hold me back son! Hold me back!
Its not worth it Mittens, that guy’s not worth it
That cat is so embarrassed. 
Thought that was a lion coming into shot for a split second

can't lie
I think it’s crazy one species can read another’s body language yet many humans remain clueless when an animal is pissed off.
Maybe the cat is wearing her leash just because of the dog. She certainly provokes every stranger. So the owner has trained  a pacifist safety dog team for her.
I too have a cat named [mittens](https://imgur.com/F4Din2v)
Damn! Dogs are saving our children from beaches, our cats from street fights, and ourselves from crippling panic attacks. What aren't they doing to fix our lives!?
This is so fucking amazing, i love goldens.
Stoop kid shouldn't leave his stoop!
Holy crap--this makes me want to get a golden to keep my cats in line!
Can you have a more loveable breed.

It's like my stronger friend when I tried to pick a fight with a guy who would beat my ass up ez
Hold me back! Hold me back, bro!
“Come on, Sassy, let’s go now.”

“Shadow, I’m focusing right n—Ok. I guess I’m leaving. You got off easy on this one, pal!”
Wow animals are getting pretty smart
Golden retrievers are truly nature’s perfect mother.
Retriever doing retrievy stuff
This deescalated quickly
"dude, seriously? We've been over this, that cat is twice your size, come on we're going home, be the better cat"

"IMMA RIP HIS FOOKIN HEAD M8 I SWEAR ON ME MUM"

"yeah yeah, let's keep moving before you get hurt" 
That cat is not a Mittens. I see no markings on those paws
WHEN dogs tell you no more fighting
The two goldens were having a nice conversation in the back, then they look and see Mittens getting ready to fight.

"Oh gosh, there goes Mittens again. Give me a second, I'll be right back."
That dog is the cat's therapy dog. 
“It’s over mittens! I have the high ground.”

“You underestimate my pow-“

“Human said no fighting”

“Dammit this is an acting class!!”
My Weimaraner did this to his cat once when a stray tried to make our backyard its home. I had the cat on a leash but my Weimaraner came over and picked up his cat (he picked the kitten up in his mouth out of a box of free to good home kittens and that's how we got the cat) and started walking towards the porch till he realized the cat was still on a leash and just game me this bewildered and annoyed look that made me think "I don't want my cat getting Feline AIDS fucker, let's go." Got my spray bottle of vinegar and tagged the stray till it went away. Got me some roosters the following week from my cousin's farmstead. So now we got no snakes, coons, or stray cats in our backyard. At least no living ones. Had to toss a coon carcass they were eating from in the black fly larvae box for my aquaponics system and give the brothers some black fly larvae for their good work (chickens love black fly larvae).

My parents’ husky took on the role of referee for the cats. Whenever she hears growling or hissing she runs over and breaks it up.
Mittens had the low ground, the battle was already lost. The dog saved Mitten's life that day. 
I am genuinely curious why it seems that dogs always break up cat fights. 
Mittens: "you're lucky hes holding me back bitch!"

"Dammit Bob, why do you always wanna fight someone when you're high on catnip?"
Cat on a leash! Hilarious 
Man, I swear dogs have special predisposition toward harm prevention. On 2 different occasions and with 2 different dogs, one would always run over and paw me over whenever I start nervously biting my nails and another broke up a fight between my ex and I. He was watching us having an argument on the sofa and as temper rose as we got louder and louder. Finally he jumped on to the sofa and also lodged himself between us while pawing my face to shut the fuck up (he was my dog so he felt comfortable doing that).

Cracked us up and stopped the fight cold, and I still have flashbacks of his human-like, genuinely concerned face pawing at my lips to this day. 
That's a brave Goldie... That cat was set on flip out mode.

Looks like mom forced doggo to take little cat bro out with him. Other doggo has a shit eating grin; probably an only child that doesn't have to deal with annoying younger siblings.
Mittens just gives up on life immediately 
I wonder if cats would do the same thing if two dogs started fighting.

Nah, who are we kidding. They'd probably instigate that shit.
Mittens was fixin to get his butt whupped, that big ole street cat looked mean.
Thats just like me and my ex wife, but the cat doesnt have my house, car and kids.

So thats why they are called retrievers. I get it.
 I love how the cat is like, “wait. No, hang on, what is happening... fine, god damnit.” 
Hold me back ~~dawg~~ dog
Somebody needs to make a gif of this with some funny dialogue-captions added.
We had gotten kittens and wanted to see how they would react to the outdoors. We lived on a busy street so we were unsure if we should let them out. My cat bolted toward the front yard immediately. My 10 year old German Shepherd hunted him down, and carried him by the scruff of his neck in her teeth back to us and dropped him at our feet. Sweetest thing ever and maybe saved his life.

This is why dogs are the best support class no question.

The other golden retriever is gesturing to the other cat at the end like "you go on home now, ya hear? Go on."
