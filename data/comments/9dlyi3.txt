We all saw the behind the scenes video bro... let the doggo eat :)
Pretty sure that's cannibalism.

How did he get into the ball game? Did the gate attendants think he was a good little boy? 
Found him on @dash.dog
It‚Äôs a dog eats dog world out there. 
Go Mariners!
Safeco!!
Go M‚Äôs
Being a Mariners' fan this season sure is ruff.  
Hot dawg he did it!
Did he get to eat it afterwards? He nailed being adorable, he deserves compensation!
Your good boy dresses better than I do
Safeco Field
Well hot dog

can dogs eat mustard?
There's a grate-type barrier behind the dog on the frontpage GIF and there isn't on this one. Looks like the same dog, bandana, and hat but might be a different game. 
LITERALLY THE PPST BELOW THIS ONE IS THE VIDEO OF THE PHOTO BEING TAKEN LOL
Lol, I saw a vid of this being taken. Glad to see it worked out!
When a Reddit fan captures a Reddit fan taking pictures for Reddit!!!
[deleted]
He is a super star! He is smiling ear to ear and does not appear to mind his human dressing him up! Such a lovable face. Give him a belly rub from Karen in pennsylvania!
If you go on r/eyebleach there is a video of this guy taking this photo
I SAW THE VID WHAT A GOODBOY!!
AYE GUYS
I FOUND EM
This is too many levels of meta
I swear a video of you taking this picture was just on my homepage. 
So meta
How many hot dogs were harmed in the making of this photo?
The final product is just as good as the behind the scenes. 
Awww! I just saw a video of this good boy trying not to eat the hot dog!
Does this count as r/tworedditorsonecup ??
This is right above the video of the guy watching you get the shot in my feed :)
 

I saw these literally right next to each other
Meta.
I thought it was a Muppet at first.

LOL!
HE DID IT!!!!!
How do you train or prepare a dog to not be afraid of all the lights/sounds/people?  
I have a boxer pup that loves people and other animals. I would love to take him to a baseball game, however I took him to the beach and he was afraid the whole time, tail between the leg, didn't want to say hi to anyone - totally not like himself. I'm worried he would be the same at a baseball game.
The internet is an amazing thing.
I swear I saw the video of this being taken somewhere else on here. 
R/aww doggin it
Inspired me to make hot dogs for dinner 10/10 would do again 
How much did the M's lose by? 
Don‚Äôt get much better than a ball game with your best friend. 
Someone give this dog a brand deal!
Selfie dicipline att its finest
Im sure the woofer wouldn't be as happy if he knew the name of what was in his mouth. 
As unhealthy that is, I would really like to see goodboy to eat his prize. Some closure for little people :P
Definitely better than I was expecting!!!! 10/10
Boop
You know this dog is too much like a human 
lol. He started eating that hot dog 2 seconds after this was taken.
Cutest Baseball Boy Ever!! 
My good boy is wicked smaht
Go Mariners!
I saw you making this photo
Oh yeah, love that dog on dog action
Alright. I need a Golden Retriever. Now.

‚ÄúGood slave got my karma. 666/666.‚Äù 
SO FERKIN GOOD
Saw the video earlier and was hoping that the guy was a Redditor. So glad he is because this picture is too freaking cute!! 
MY HEART IS EXPLODING FROM ALL THE HAPPY
I was waiting for this since this morning!
Who needs a kiss cam when you've got a good boy cam?
Yo someone else got you in a video of you making this!
Is this that dog from an earlier reddit post when he was trying to get the photo?
I have sat in this section.  For a girl scout night.  We were the lucky recipients of the very top row.  This is an annual event and we had top row seats two years running.
Maybe it's just the uploaded picture but I didn't like the background focus and quality found it distracted from a good shot.  Did some quick edits to add a bit of lens blur to background and some slight balancing to reduce the highlights.

SOMEONE POSTED A VIDEO OF THIS PERSON TAKING A PIC OF HIS DOG AND PUT IT ON THE SAME SUBREDDIT...REDDIT-SEPTION
He's rocking that handkerchief.  12/10
Good boy
The photo is cute but I can see from the behind the scenes video that your dog is overweight. Feeding him bread, cheese, sugar (in the sauce), and overfeeding are all bad for him. Especially since this breed characteristically overeats if they can. Please look after your pup by keeping him healthier.
You sound suspiciously like a dog, OP. 
12/10 take it or leave it
I think I‚Äôve seen a video of from someone who was sitting behind you who thought that you‚Äôre dog was cute
All American pup.

I've seen him beforeü§îü§î
Is that ketchup on that hot dog?!

I was waiting on this to hit the front page after seeing the vid 
You da real MPV, I was dying to see the actual photo! 
Best photo on the internet right now paws down

DOG eats Hot DOG. A little strange......
PHOTO DOG!!

I needed this closure
I was at the game. This pup dominated the big screen!
Link to original?
Amazing
Oh my god I was so sad that I couldn‚Äôt see the finished product!
How does this dog have more willpower than I do?
Cognitive dissonance at its finest
Should make this my tinder picture lmao
Where did the fence go?
Knew this was Safeco immediately. I might need a hobby that isn't baseball.
wait, isn't this the video?
It's a dog-eat-dog world out there
Awwwwww
I get that reference
I saw I video of you taking the picture
If you look at the gif, then the picture, they are two different dogs... and sadly two different hot dogs :(
Did you let him eat it?
I wonder what the convo was like between the owner of the dog and the other guy who was recording him take the picture. He probably made the front page and told him to post it. 
omggg all that hard work was worth it!

I saw the video of this being taken earlier and thought  "I *neeeeed* to see the actual photo". So happy to have that happen.

God, I love dogs.

Holy shit I don‚Äôt believe it... someone recorded you taking this exact picture and posted it here 
Damn, top comment is 15,000 upvotes and they deleted it? Wtf

What do you call a dog in the summertime? 
I just saw someone post a video getting this shot. 
Why have kids when you have dog?
Yellow labs really are the best ^_^
Wait what is there a glitch in the matrix, cause i saw this dog and owner trying to get this pic...omg to real
What an amazing story, my heart just swelled 100 times over. That was  not a human man, he truly was an angel in disguise, God Bless everyone involved, the ones who experienced ,read, shared, and reposted  this wonderful story. May this world be blessed with more Angels like that Angel. 
Man, how did you manage this pic?   Do you have video of this being set up? 
10/10 is a sadly low rating. I'd say more like 12 or 13/10
I saw the "making of" gif on r/eyebleach and am so glad the finished result on here too!!
This dog might be the best dog ever.
Wait, isn't the process of taking this picture on r/woof_irl? https://www.reddit.com/r/woof_irl/comments/9djyr4/woof_irl/?utm_source=reddit-android
There's any other pic which was u taking the picture of the dog
Different photo/place, doesn't have the fence behind him that was in the video. 
I feel like this pup is taking his grandpup to his first ball game haha

Your dog looked obese in the other video, feed him better or he might not be around for that much longer.
This is what it means to be an American. Golden Retriever with a hot dog at a ballpark.

Beutiful dog. And the hot dog.
That is one HOT dog.
Hold on
 I just saw a video on r/aww of this exact video being taken!?!
I hope he didn't eat any mustard that's a big no no for doggos
So can the redditor who took this picture, and the redditor who took a video of this guy taking a picture just kiss already? Meet, have dinner together....Clearly you two have a cute love for baseball doggo in common so..

The hot dog looks very fake to me.
Next have him chugging a twelve dollar beer!
Photography is the story I fail to put into wor
Good dog got to enjoy his good dog right after this.
He got the photo but did he get to eat the hot dog? 
This is GREAT! A wee piece of doggo internet history. Hope you gave him a heckin pettin afterwards. 
This is why I love reddit.
Safeco field? 
Did someone really spend 20 bucks on a stadium hot dog for their dog to eat?!
Too bad it's over exposed. 
Title gore
A redditor taking a video of another redditor taking a picture of his dog. Mind blown
am I the only one who saw the video of this pic being taken XD 
I feel no different about this picture than I would about a picture of a fat man, taken at the worst possible angle, holding a hot dog in his mouth, which is also crusty and dripping with saliva. This is disgusting. Why is this on the front page?
m e t a b o y e 
I smell a ruse
Can someone provide a side-by-side of this and a screen shot from the video? Something looks different and I can‚Äôt figure out what. I‚Äôm on mobile and it‚Äôs not going well. 
Dog eat dog world 
How many hotdogs did this take?
Wait theres no gate behind, how many hotdogs did he eat that day?!?!?!?!?!
Oooo that looks like such a tasty dog 





I obviously meant the hotdog 
Awesome 
Is this cannibalism? 
Hey I saw you in the parking lot earlier, that's how I know you. 
There's no fence behind him like in the video we just saw. How often do you do this? 
Safeco field yeah? Beautiful stadium 
$10/$10
****M E T A****
I sure as hell hope that good boy enjoyed his hot dog!!  He earned it!
My longest gud boi ever
I'm having fits just imagining how many places the ketchup and mustard may have gone. That's going to be one dirty boy.

Impressive - that's impressive stamina to NOT gobble up that hot dog.
This goodest of boyes deserves all the treats
What a good good boy!

I think this pup got more than one hotdog, the background is different in the video that was just posted.
Go M‚Äôs!
When did this sub started to allow canibalism?
Cannibalism
how did you get a dog into a ball park lol?
He better have let him eat that hot dog!
They allow dogs at the baseball field? That‚Äôs cool üòé 
That's gonna be a pretty damp hot dog

If he didn't get to eat that hotdog imma go John Wick on your ass.
Some say he's the goodest boy around
Is this canabilism
Is the hotdog real 
Was probably a $12 hotdog
That's a nice fuckin dog. 
This is cannibalism.
What a GOOD BOY!!  Wish I could give him hugs!!!
Safeco Field! 
HE IS THE EPITOME OF HAPPINESS
MARINERS DOGGO IS HAPPY. 

This came out so well too! This is adorable! Pup's probably happy with a good game, a good frank, awesome owner, and the W they got haha.

How many hot dogs has that dog held in its mouth? The other picture had a railing/fence behind it.

My dog would just gobble the whole thing up.
Feeding a diaper hotdog is so bad. Esp one with cheese 
The best boy!! 
I love how people just love animals. Nature‚Äôs way of giving human beings 100% natural anti-depressant and anti-anxiety solution through unconditional love.
Best ... Day ... Ever
Hey wait a second!! This picture was taken from a different location than the video we all just saw! Did the good boy get 2 separate hot dogs? Did you take the first one out of his mouth and, then move to a different spot!? 
The original Post can be found under instagram: @dash.dog
Someone took a video of you trying to get this photo. I saw the effort of the dog trying his best to not eat the hotdog. Glad the photo turned up perfect. 
A happy Mariners Dog!!
Dodger Dog!
Who is a good boy?
You are a good boy!
Yay!! This is what I needed after seeing the other post!
This has made my day!

Hope he got to have that as a treat!
The guy was trying to get the Mariners logo in the shot but failed. I'd say 9.5 out of ten, but good boy is still good
Gotta love a walk in the park 
Let's go Mariners! Let's go Good Boyes
Good boy! 
Someone clipped the process of doing this what a obidient dog 
Go mariners!
This is an amazingly good boi 

I have to guard my dog from stealing MY hotdogs, no way I could have every managed this with any of the dogs that have been in my life.
He made it to the HOME page!

Get it guys? Home? GET IT?
do dogs like mustard?
Can confirm from prior content; My heart is now a puddle.
This is so cute. And I love that it‚Äôs at my home stadium. I wanna go to Bark in the Park so bad, but I can never make it. He looks like such a good boy!
Best ballpark hotdog salesman ever!
Thank you, I was left on edge
HOw'd you get him to not eat it long enough to take a picture?
Adorable!
How'd you put food in a Golden's mouth and not get them to devour the whole thing in .2 seconds?
What team was this?
What a beautiful photo! Well earned hot dog I'd say!
I certainly hope that good boy was allowed to eat the hot dog after posing so patiently.
‚ÄúPhotos taken moments before disaster‚Äù
I was at Safeco yesterday!  Simba cam was funny.  
THERE WAS A WIRE FENCE BEHIND DOGGO IN THE VIDEO, WHERE IS IT IN THIS PICTURE!?!?!?!?
May your goodboye never be hit with the sog.

This is adorable. He's ready for the game now.

Must be a different dog. The video showed a metal fence behind it. Sorry guys.
I like how a good boy with a hot dog acquired more up votes then Burt Reynolds dying Lmao
Yassssss!
Why on earth do the Mariners need public funding for upgrades to one of the best parks in the league? Doesn‚Äôt the city have a major homeless problem?
I read in my dog training manual that dogs do not like mustard.  In fact, if you put mustard on a cracker somewhere-- they will condition themselves to not taking treats that are left out.  
  
Just thought I should point out that dogs don't like the same flavors we do.

How many attempts did the owner make?
This is cool because he's not swimming in a pool of drool.  Dog has control!
My dog would have eaten that hotdog in at least 0.2947 seconds

Holy shit! This is hands down the best mind fuck thing I‚Äôve ever seen on Reddit. If you know others throw me
Canibalismo!!!
Cute!
N I C E
So cute!
When will cannibalism end
this is the bestest boy
Is he a panthers good boy
Big baby!!!!! Of whom I love
There was a honeycomb looking fence behind doggo in the other video. Just sayin'. Still cool.
I know the Mariners are a little behind in the Wild Card race, but that is a super empty Safeco Field. Come on, Seattle fans!
That hot dog must be ridiculously **soggy** after waiting so long for the perfect moment. 
is it safe for a dog to eat all those ingredients 
Favourite all time on reddit
I was just there the other day!
How many hot dogs did it take? He ate at least 1
Take me out to the ball game        
Take me out to the fair          
Buy me some hot dogs and throw some sticks         
I don't care if you take a few pics        
'Cause it's nom nom nom on these steps here        
If I don't eat it's a shaaaaaame!            
And it's one! two! hotdogs I eat        
At the old baaaaall gaaaaaame!
Babe Woof.
Why 10/10, I rate a 1343256744467/10
I am so happy to see this.
May I have him?
How freaking precious. He's posing so well. 13/10
.
I met this dog at the game last night. Can confirm, goodest boy. 
It's dash!!!
Hate to be that guy but theres no reason to put ketchup and mustards on a dog treat (i'm pretty sure mustard isn't good for dogs anyway) 

Very cute picture though
Do this at a stadium in one of the multicultural parts of Western Europe and people will be constantly asking/telling you to keep your dog away. I can't go to the park with my dog without seeing some scared weirdos run across the street to get away from my small dog.
Get‚Äôem while they‚Äôre hot!
GOMS
Yaaaaassss
Ryder the golden retriever lol
What a rollercoaster of emotion 
well hot dog!
Video of you taking this
I just want to point out that the hotdogs at safeco are like $15 a pop so thats 15 bucks right there
They let dogs into baseball stadiums??
Fuck I want a hot dog now
Go M's!! I think we're losing.. 
This was a bad thing.
Bark at the park! Go Ms!
Go Mariners!
Safeco! Hell yes!
IN CONTROL
I love reddit. 
I love Reddit.
Follow this dog on instagram!!! He has a lot of cute pictures. He‚Äôs Dash.dog 
Best good boy
Oh wow! That's a good boy right there!

Safeco?
Is this the eagles opener????
This good boy is responsible for a collective 150,000 karma at the time of this comment
Minute Maid park? 
This good boy is all over fb 
Different spot tho 
101k upvotes and gold.

Its a picture of a fucking dog.

Someone spent money on this.
U/SeattleMana posted a vid of this being taken
That's adorable!!
There better be no onions in that hot dog!
TIL you can take dogs to the baseball park. 
such a good boy. im glad he got to enjoy a sodo dog with lots of ketchup and mustard! well deserved. 
Mariners Field?
Inspired me to make hot dogs for dinner 10/10 would do again 
I can't believe you bought a $25 hot dog for this.
Good boye loves his M‚Äôs
Small world indeed
RESPECT... even I would have ate the hotdog before the picture. 
These here were my worry when I was a kid thinking dogs would think we were eating dogs so I called them franks and such this is a really good picture too thankyou for sharing this too
u/SeattleMana 
Of course he‚Äôs a resditor
Is that nacho cheese of mustard? If it‚Äôs nacho cheese that boy knows how to dog :) 
How can the dog not eat the hotdog right away ?
Wasnt there a fence behind the dog in the video? I guess they tried another spot
Yeah, good boy
I've watched this post climb from 1K to 100K+ and it still deserves more. If you consider your dog as a child then this is the picture perfect moment. 
Go Mariners!
But did he get the hotdog?
META...... 
Is good boy a Dbacks fan?
Damn I been following this dog on ig for a while now, I used to see him around the breweries when I went! Good boye confirmed
"Does a dog REALLY need mustard on his hotdog?"
This is perfect 
I go to ball games to stop being married / babysitting. Guess I'm wired wrong. 
Lmao this picture isn‚Äôt even that cute. I can‚Äôt even come to this subreddit anymore without being utterly disappointed by trending ‚Äúgood boy‚Äù and ‚Äúpupper‚Äù content that I could easily replicate just by taking a picture of my bitch when she‚Äôs scared.
Skydome?
Was this at hard rock stadium?
Up voting because Mariners and good boy! Haha
u/YourWebcam
If you're going to give your dog a hot dog, at least skip the sauce. It's too much salt for them.
Yes go mariners, and doggos ‚ù§
He's such a dad 
This is what I come here for! Reddit rules the world. 
No way 
I. Love. Him. 
Can‚Äôt upvote, cannibalism is not a joke
Such a good boy.
Wow much self control 
Has nobody noticed that this pic is taken from a different spot than the behind the scenes video? There is a enclosed railing behind the dog in the video.
You are being [watched](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeopleFuckingDying/comments/9dmg0f/small_dog_devoured_by_large_dog_cruel_owner_just/?st=JLRCOFHJ&sh=2fd41f2c) 
Is this at the DBacks stadium? 
didn't squeeze the slightest bit. nice.
False. Nothing showing the Mariners. . .

You've got to think about the next level: On doggie night, your dog had a mariner dog.
Wait a second. Didn‚Äôt I see this photo getting taken in video earlier today? 
Go Mariners! Looks like Safeco to me.
That's no dodger dog!
SafeCo!! 
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH

Bark at the Park.

At least one good thing came out of the Mariners season...

Most patient dog ever. Goodest boy of them all!!
Alf went to a ball game.

Safeco Field?! What a cute boi!
Looks like joe Rogan and his dog had a baby
Safeco?
Finally, something good to come out of Safeco Field. 
SAFECO FIELD!!
He probably destroyed that dog seconds after this picture was taken 
9/10 the hotdog is off center. But still cool.
This makes me so happy. 
Lol

Looks like Safeco!
