Welp, looks like you'll have to drop out and play with him full time. 
That‚Äôs the front door, right? Lol just making sure, sometimes my parents‚Äô dog would stare at the closet door. He wasn‚Äôt the smartest boy, but he was the sweetest. 
Never leave home again

Can we see a reunion pic?
I wonder where he thinks you go and what you do on the other side of that door.
English springer spaniel?
Well I'm super pregnant and I'm gonna go cry now. 
Lie down. Curl into the fetal position. Try not to cry. Cry a lot.
Also want to apologize for the mess, we are just moving in. And Oliver‚Äôs favorite toy is that clothes hanger so that‚Äôs why that is there.

Edit: words. 
I‚Äôm a bit of a neat freak so that‚Äôs why I feel the need to apologize I guess üò¨
Also I haven‚Äôt been in my house for two weeks! I live in a dog friendly area so I‚Äôve been taking him everywhere with me :) He is doing good with crate training and being alone though, we understand separation anxiety is a thing. 
He can count... one, two, three, forever! You left him forever again. 
[removed]
Now you know for sure that‚Äôs your dog 
/r/PetTheDamnDog !
This is a mean picture to send you, but adorable.  Adora-cruel.
He protec

He attac

But importantly

He wait till you get bac
you have to drop out now
And so you dropped out of college and never left the house again,

THE END
He's going to be so happy when you get back.
They are mental dogs and never stop. Very intelligent and so loyal. Ours is 5 years old now and as mad as a box of frogs 
"Surely they'll be back any second."
‚ÄúPay attention, Duckford. We must keep vigilant watch for the man return‚Äù
Hachiko üò≠
Oh, my heart!! 
Drop out you monster
"Mom, come back... Please" :*(
My dogs would always lay down right by the door waiting for us to go home. There were times that I would stay at home while my family went out and hours later, they would still be right by the door until they realized my presence.

The first time I went back to visit my parents after both of my dogs had passed I ended up sobbing my heart out because I realized that I would never be greeted with the yelping and jumping and circling again. Its been 7 months and I still need to hold back a tear whenever I go home. 
Can we get a just got home photo to see dogo reaction
I thought I was on r/MasterReturns and was waiting for the gif to load 
Get ready for the separation anxiety. The pup will adjust and learn the routine soon - if destruction happens don't make the mistake of thinking it is a naughty dog. They do it when they are stressed. 

Remember that since birth, it has known his mother & siblings, then you. You are the most important thing in the dogs world. 
What a loyal stuffed animal. It'll always be waiting for you to get home.

The dog, on the other hand...
‚ÄúMy mummy didn‚Äôt really leave me, she just went out quickly and I‚Äôll sit here for when she comes back‚Äù - puppy
He miss you more than your boyfriend does
Lost baby :( !
We don‚Äôt deserve doggos. 
You better quit college and give that god damn dog some love, right now!
Your dog is going to college?
Just FYI your bf is also doing the same thing so please come back quick. 
College is overrated anyway...(cries uncontrollably in dark corner)
I suggest you should leave everything and commence rushing towards him now.
gotta post that reaction when you come back!
I feel like such a dumbass waiting for gif, I'm so drunk lol
Do you have a boyfriend?
This is very heartbreaking but also wholesome 
Aw man... üòì
get your ass back home **right now**
That's very sweet.

‚ÄãIf you guys start separation anxiety training now, it won't get worse and eventually your leaving will be a non-event.
Oh welllll, you didn‚Äôt need college anywag
I pupper dawg

I own a gurl

She play wit me

And I wit her

One dai she leev

She go away

And so wit burd 

I wate and stay

Coz she luff me

And I luff hur

And soon wee bee

Back toogether
Dogs are the best friend man has ever had‚ù§Ô∏è
Damn that breaks my heart lol.
Totally unrelated to the dog but I still find it so weird that in a lot of American houses they have the front door directly connected to the living room.
Give him plenty of toys, he will eat anything that smells like you while looking for you,springers have terribly bad separation anxiety,and  will love you to death https://i.imgur.com/FX24hXo.jpg 
My dog still does this....and he is 14 years old. The love of a dog sometimes feels undeserved....

Give your pup some good rubs when you get back!
Oh dogs.

"She's been gone for forever! ...or maybe just 5 minutes.. no wait, 4 hours... I really need a watch."
2 dogs is the key.
My wife takes our 5 month old puppy to work everyday and I also walk Louise, our puppy, to the car in the morning and get her in the back seat.  I say goodbye to both of my favorite girls in the world and as I walk back to the house/when my wife drives away Lousie puts her front paws and head resting on the top of the backseat staring at me as they leave.

It's heart wrenching and heartwarming at the same time.
that's why I prefer dogs more then cats :) 
:( poor boy .. doesn't understand :(
Seeing your doggo just patiently waiting for you to come back home is a sad- and sweet thing, this picture kind of reminds me of our own family dog.

When I still lived at home, every morning, our family dog would sit infront of my bedroom door and do small cute barks (I dont know how she learned this considering she's a medium-large dog) asking me to let her in. We would then play together, go on walkies etc. generally just spend most of the day together.

I moved out a few weeks ago, and I havent had the opportunity to visit home, and recently I recived a message from my family that our family dog hasnt been feeling well (eats less, little energy and would only play for short amounts of time).

Apparently, ever since I left,  our dog would still sit in front a shut door leading to my bedroom. She would just sit there for hours and wait for me to open it, and not knowing I'm not there anymore. Its heartbreaking and I do miss hearing those tiny barks and seeing that tail go crazy when I open my door, hopefully I'll have time to visit her again soon! :)
Aww he misses you and can't wait for his best friend to come back.
I thought docking was illegal , Also he looks lovely and I hope you have as many happy years together as possible. Is he a cocker mix? 
Get that dog a dog
If you break up, who keeps the dog
I got a dog two weeks ago, too. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is what he‚Äôs been doing when I‚Äôm at work all day, because when I get home, he‚Äôs right by the door and his food is uneaten. Poor babies!
So... you‚Äôre saying you haven‚Äôt left the house in two whole weeks?
Do you feel like a piece of shit now?
That's cool that you'd let your dog stay home to take college courses. What online dog college does he attend?
If it takes forever,  I will wait for you.
For a thousand summers i will wait for you
Your dog must be feeling " missyou so bad "
Is he an English Springer Spaniel?
Aaaany minute now........SQUIRREL?!
You know what people? This looks like a good boy. 
Hachiko flashbacks
Did anyone else mistake the circular grey intercom for a live video feed graphic?
5 and a half years in of having my first dog, it never gets any easier leaving him when going to work. It honestly breaks my heart every single time :(

But the amount of happiness and joy that he exhibits when I get home is amazing and I know would never be matched by any human instead. 
We really don‚Äôt deserve dogs. 
Yeah, left for University. My cat sits where my computer used to be and just stares. I miss him.
What classes is he taking?
Probably waiting for his tail to come home
You should always train your puppies to cope with being alone. I.e. we have two and when they were puppies we would: 
- go for a walk for 20-60min without them
- sleep in different room at night, they do whine and it sounds harsh, but you going them a favour as when they get older separation anxiety can be a real issue
- ignoring them ‚Äúa bit‚Äù and not giving them attention all the time 

We love our dogs, but i‚Äôve seem people that didn‚Äôt do simple steps like this and dogs were miserable when they went to work etc. + they would often damage things as they anxiety was too much.  
Looks like he chose you as his master
you are coming home now.
This is what my cats do when I go the bedroom and close the door.
you get home now and give this good boy lots of pets 
This must be so tough for him and ducky.
Never get a pet with your SO.
Welp this is the saddest thing I‚Äôve seen today so far
He brought his favourite toy to entince you back. üò¢üò¢
Well obviously you have to drop out now, college was fun while it lasted! 
Now we want a come back home video OP. 
Hate tail docking. Out of interest what county are you from? It's illegal here and just wondering who still allows this?
I just got my puppy on Friday, he's six weeks old and has that same duck.. He won't stop humping it... We call it his fuck duck
You haven't left your home in two weeks?
We don't deserve our canine friends
We all know that you are just hiding behind that door for several hours. But being good boy he waits for you.

"You were gone forever! I COUNTED!"
- Dog
Dog: She‚Äôs coming back... any second... aaaaannnyyy second... ok just a bit longer...
No one else is concerned this is the first time she left her place in two weeks?
Go back now!
Docked tail? Where is this?
What happened to the dog's tail? There isn't much of it.
I set up a camera so I can see what my dog does while I'm at work. He does the same thing and starts to just pace the whole day. Luckily I'm able to bring him to work and he's the most valuable employee now 
springer spaniel. beautiful dogs. Easy to train. But they develop separation anxiety quite easily if you don't walk it at least 4 times a day and make sure someone is always home. Their minds are always hunting and chasing birds. They need to be mentally exhausted so they can rest when you do have to be away from them. Plus kids. They love kids and playing. Is that a toy duck? Perfect toy for a water dog. 
I am a dog attorney and I will sue you in dog court!! But we can settle now for two pats and four "good bois."
It must be really stressful to be a dog and never know what's going on.
Welcome to motherhood
[deleted]
what are you doing?? go home NOW!!
Wow. What happens to the poor dog when you two break up?
It's creeping my husband out how much this looks like our full grown cocker spaniel. The spots on the sides and speckles on the snout and everything! 
Pure love üíó 
yo why'd you cut off its tail?
Idk y college kids are always insisting on owning pets such as dogs while away at school, incredibly selfish on their part as they cannot dedicate the time and care need to give it a meaningful existence 
And when he leaves it will start howling and crying, hopefully it‚Äôs not in an apartment where the neighbors have to hear it all day. Everyone wants  dogs but have no idea how they act when their gone....but their neighbors do
Absolute monster. How could you do this to him?! 
I've had my dog for 5 years now and he still does that. It makes me so sad. :/
Just be glad there is no audio.
I quit my job to freelance/work from home and I‚Äôd be lying if I said it wasn‚Äôt at least partially because I felt bad about leaving the dogs all day long. 
I got you a duck for when you get home, he's lying dead next to me!
I‚Äôd have to drop out that picture is brutal 


‚ÄúOkay hooman I sit here until you return‚Äù 
Something so nice, yet so sad... üòì  I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without my dog, who would do this exact same thing.
" if I wait here long enough she'll surely return". 
And the long watch begins
My dog does the same thing when my parents go out.
Heartbroken pic.
Loyalty at it's finest
cute
This breaks my heart
This picture made me cry
That puppy looks like a sugondese breed
Xtremely loyal boy
My doggo acts like a big puppy, and when I leave home I always worry that he‚Äôll sit at the door waiting too long before he goes back to the couch to sleep or whatever. Sometimes I‚Äôll turn around cause I forgot my wallet or phone, and sure enough he‚Äôs still sitting or laying down by the door :( makes me so sad lol
Springer spaniel! Mine is the same, so attached. 
I thought this was video at first and was impressed at how long he sat like that without moving.
deleted.
Definitely thought this was a video and was waiting for something to happen. 
Ya gotta stop going to college. YA GOTTA!
My mum told me my childhood dog did this.  Got her during the summer and she got used to being home.

*They‚Äôre all good dogs*
Ah college life: where you never fully unpack from moving. 
WTF :(
When is OP coming out of the closet?!
Slight risk of developing Canine Anxiety Separation. 
Confirmed - Good boy 
This physically hurts me...
"If it takes forever, I'll wait for you!!" 
Looks like you have their hearts. 

Good job!


clearly he loves you more. 
He got him stuffed? 
The unplayed with toy is so heartbreaking
You‚Äôre his human!
Its time to matriculate the puppy at your college.
right in the feels
Aw so cute! He misses his human momma. You're gonna get so many kisses when you get home. 
Oh my god so cute/sad
Stay at home boyfriend?
When I take my rescue dog outside, just before I leave for the day, I always give her the same treat she gets every time she potties.

When I get home 8 hours later, she eats the treat.
Go. Back.
like if you cried
r/masterreturns incoming? I hope?
He might love you more than your boyfriend
Awww that is precious. You have a devoted member of the family with this cutie. Enjoy him, teach him and love him.  He will bring you joy and laughter and make your relationship with your boyfriend stronger. Give this cutie a belly rub from redditt!
Call the doggo
Waiting for mama to come home.
There's nothing in the rulebook that says a dog CAN'T go to college. Just saying.
English springer? Neediest dogs in the world. 
Awwwww!
e
We have the exact same duckie for our cocker spaniel.  Excellent choice.
Dogs are loyal and this is the proof of it. 
What OP isn‚Äôt telling you is that‚Äôs the door to the basement and he senses something...

Anytime my animals stare at things it freaks my wife out. I find it funny and mess with her about it. 
Haha
Aww
Oh. My. Dog. 
I never get over dogs have such child like innocence. I bet he gets away with all sorts of mischief :)
Reminds me of hachi.
Your boyfriend is clever.  I only had dumb pictures of myself looking lonely to send with hope she'd return....Your boyfriend has something so much stronger haha
I haven‚Äôt left my house in two weeks either 
Thats it, you can never leave again. 
What a monster !
How can u leave such pupper/doggo alone...?
GO HOME ASAP !!!!


[Your dog, probably. ](https://i.imgur.com/cpJLnH9.jpg)
Aww, poor little furry baby is lonely. 
Good to know you two finally live together!
That feeling when you see him as you come home, wagging his tail full speed, greeting you everyday, will be something you look forward to everytime.
Go home you monster!
You didn't leave your home for two weeks?
Hooman left 
Pupper wait 
You've been home for two weeks straight? 
Cute. But do train him that get use to that you leav him some time

I had dog for 15 yrs. Every time my mother left he wil sit same way and donno if right word but he cry for long time and got no rest

This last thing you wand and for your dog 
awwww i wish my dog was this nice to me
You monster
What breed? Looks like a mix but bears a striking resemblance to my little dude Rocket https://imgur.com/a/sPnDx7S
Oh that's heartbreaking
You didn't leave the house for two weeks??
Aww no, poor puppy. :( He doesn't understand where his human went.
A question about American homes: is that the front door of the house, or is there still a hallway behind that?

Because that looks quite substantial for an indoors door, lock and all, but it would be rather weird not to have any sort of entryway.
And so a dog's watch begins...
Awww he misses you 
Aw man... he miss u
No, you were not the only one who thought this was a video ü§£ü§£ü§£
You should leave one of your shirts so it will comfort him throughout the day or days.
When you're near home later today, tell your bf to start filming the front door so he gets the puppy seeing you come back. And make an update!
Oh my heart! Poor baby!
Is it a Springer? Most lovely dogs 
I would like to see more pictures of Oliver please. 
Good boy.
He is still waiting you üëç
My dog is 13 and I caught him staring at the door today while I was making breakfast. He always lays within view of the front door so that he‚Äôs there for when my mum gets home. I let him out for a pee and he wandered down the driveway to go find her haha. 
If it taaaakes forever, I will waaiiitt for you
I feel like such a dumbass waiting for gif, I'm so drunk lol
I thought it was a video for some reason and I sat here for about 2 minuets 
Home Depot plug.
awwwww
Aww he misses you and can't wait for his best friend to come back.
I just realised for all dogs know you're just stood the other side of that door and they're expecting you to open it any time now
She will come back now

She will come back now

She will come back now

She will come back now
So cute!  
My malamute would chew the door and walk through... :/
I would like to say about IOST TECHNOLOGY IS WONDERER THEN OTHER.
Aww my heart
for crying out loud, **DROP OUT AND PLAY WITH THE PUPPY**
Take your dog to school day.....everyday :P
Awwwww
I‚Äôm a whole fucking mess rn. I was watching Golden Buzzer moments and now because of this I‚Äôm drowning in a puddle of my own tears. I‚Äôd drop out and cuddle him forever. 
Aww this is so cute! 
That's a big puppy. 
Sometimes a dog is as good as any man
So cute!
That‚Äôs a beautiful springer  
Aww\~, poor baby. He's waiting before the door. Make sure to give him a lot of playtime and belly scratches. Also, what breed is he?
Something "trending" that actually is trending? I don't think the system works.
You go to state??
Noti squad -.-
I failed my duties as a puppy.
Let me guess, you‚Äôre the one that feeds him, right?
That toy just lying there on his side destroyed me.
Favorite /r/aww in months.  I feel all the emotion completely.  Aww wow.
I am not crying... this is so adorable. 
Oh it's from Ace Ventura's movie. 
Bless him üòü
ohh, it‚Äôs so cute!
Hello darkness my old friend.
Why am i crying...
So I am assuming that you quit college and are now a sahm to that adorable puppy. :)
PUPPER
My dog waits at the door everyday at 5 pm because mom and his two boys will be home. 
This is weird for me but I realized that this may be the first time I see a real black and white dog with those circle spots (?).
Get another puppy so that he will have some distraction. Dogs are very much like children. 
I upvote because its cute but I wanna downvote because puppy solidarity. 
So cute
I am a grown up man, but there's a teardrop in the corner of my eye.
this is the sweetest/saddest. what‚Äôs his name OP? 
I don‚Äôt want to be that guy, but I would recommend looking into attachment disorders, having 3 dogs with that problem it‚Äôs like having 3 psycho girlfriends, very cute photo tho 
Quit college.
So cute mk
Oh pupper dupper. :(
Hey be careful he‚Äôs not developing separation anxiety. I know it‚Äôs cute but it‚Äôs quite tough for the dog. There are easy ways to play it down (I train guide dogs).
Come through the back door and surprise him.
Puppy has an obvious favorite!
Did you burst into tears? haha
"Momma, why?"
Just a question. 

How do you college people are living on your own and moreover able to afford a dog? 
I love that his ducky is right next to him, too. Seems to say, either, he's waiting for you to get back to share it, or he was hanging out there for so long he needed the company haha
I love how he has his toy next to him ready for you... my heart...
Ah my heart hurts
Aww that's so cute! 
I'm happy for you!! Take a good care of your dog. I lost mine around 2 months ago. He went out right before i left my city for college and never came back(probably someone stole him). 3 years of joys and bitter all i went with him. He calmed me when noone else could. Now it just feel weird that i don't know where he is or what he is doing as i used to be with him every single time when i was at home. Sometimes you will be mad at your dog for doing something "doggy", but then you will miss every single thing that it does. I used to be mad at him for biting my socks. But now i miss the sound that he made when biting my socks hahaha
Is that a springer? I had one growing up, they‚Äôre such sweet dogs. 
Nice try Home Depot 
Oh man. I'm having flashbacks to Jurassic Bark
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs. 
You monster
I raised beagles for 30 years.   I had to put the last one down about 6 month ago w/cancer (18 yrs for momma little ears).

This made me ; a bit    ;   I love dogs.
He thinks you‚Äôre dead!
 P A T I E N T B O Y E E
My son is doing the same thing. Feelings to the maximum!
Must be a smart dog to take college classes.
7 o. x jun. . , n
Try snap chatting and letting the puppy see and hear you. It might help them cope.
why did a dog need college classes anyway?
Ah, poor puppy, misses you! So sweet!
Oh, that's sweet. You have 2 lovers waiting for you at home.
Oh, that's sweet. You have 2 lovers waiting for you at home.
Aww man. This makes my heart physically hurt
So sweet. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is that a GSP or Brittany ?
Yep that's exactly what my dog did too when I left for school
Oh no....poor thing
Puppy is missing you
take him with you 
Oh man Springer's are a hoot. 
Aww... Springer spaniel? 
I think I died from cuteness overload.
Get one of those Petcube cameras.
I just watched the movie Hachi for the first time last night. This reminds me of Hachi. :(
I'd never leave my house again. 
My.... My heart. 
"Wow, they've been in that room for a long time."
Reminds me of frys dog
At least he sent you a picture of the dog still alive.
Well...fck college then....üòÇüòÇ
Getting Seymour vibes...sniff
aww...
Plot twist: that‚Äôs the door to the kitchen
Best reason to quit college if there is one.  
This is my lab every day.  A year old and I've worked full time ever since I've owned him and he still waits around at the door barking.  
A scene right out of Secret Life of Pets
When a wolf disappears from a pack the instinctual explanation is they've died. Not sure how long it will take him to assume this but he may greet u at times as if you've returned from the dead. Your puppy will also greet you this way.
Gonna need a follow up for r/masterreturns 
Whatüò≠aüò≠goodüò≠puppersüò≠
Lost baby :( !
You didnt leave your house for two weeks? 
Well that's one way to lay the guilt on thick and make you drop out.
Awe bless. 
Dogs are the best. My buddy‚Äôs greeting every day is the absolute greatest. 
HDS COMIN THROUGH!!! GOT A PACKAGE PEOPLE!!!!
OMG That's adorable
TURN BACK YOUR PUPPY OBVIOUSLY NEEDS YOU
I got a puppy two weeks ago as well, he‚Äôs a black Labrador and he‚Äôs adorable. When he rolls on his back he shows his teeth and his ears flop up and it makes him look like a bat üòÇ
This would destroy me emotionally and, ironically, qualify me to use the pup as an emotional support animal at school. 
I thought this was a video for way too long 
Secret life of pets 
we need a r/masterreturns update!
Ouch.
My cat does this
We can‚Äôt see his face but I can tell that is one freakin‚Äô cute dog üê∂ 
Let him FaceTime you every once and awhile so he understands you didn‚Äôt die
Your boyfriend is not so interesting as much you. The puppy must be getting bored with him and waiting eagerly for  you to come.
"Any minute now!"
Spring spaniels are very attached
Wow

We have our jobs, our classes, our friends, our chores....

Our dogs just have us.
‚ÄúYup, aaaaaaany second now‚Äù
Clearly you are the favorite
OMG - go home!!! 
Awww! Come on over to r/brittanyspaniel! 
What kind of dog is he?
I have the exact same Home Depot boxes too, btw the dog is nice
Depressed dogo
are you sure it's not a statue?
Top notch guilt trip.
Oh gosh well that doesn't make you feel like a monster does it lol
You can lay the dog down somewhere away door a few min before you leave. Then they won't have the unneeded separation anxiety. 
Faithful boye.
Is that a springer spaniel? They are the best dogs. I have a liver and white one. They definitely get attached to you! 
Looks like a Sprollie?
Your dog's in college?
At least you know who s/he likes better
He misses his mommy!

&#x200B;
Who gets the dog when you break up? 
so when you break up, who gets it?
That‚Äôs the best feeling in the world and only a dog owner can understand that bond
"What do you normally do when I'm gone?" "Wait for you to get back."
Big plans today Gidget!
Just bathe in the happiness when you get home.

That mad greeting by my 2 Borders can make a crappy day be completely forgotten. 

(they only want feeding but they are still pleased to see me!)
*stares longingly...
Jesus this looks scary like my dog. First springer? You're going to have a very exciting time. They are beautiful, crazy animals who adore their owners and attention and more attention. 
You haven‚Äôt left the house in two weeks?
Charlie waits outside the bathroom for me every morning while I shower. https://imgur.com/2gGiSLz.jpg
Your boyfriend should have replaced you with Joe.
You dog is replica of mine! Such a cutie.

Yeah. They do that. That's why humans don't deserve them.
That‚Äôs a lot loving when you get home.
Haachi in the making
That is absolutely an AWWW if I have ever seen one.......
for real though you wanna break him of this ASAP 

separation anxiety in dogs sucks ass...youre going to want to get/have him be comfortable with you guys gone for extended periods of time.

nothing worse than coming home to destroyed furniture etc
Thanks for posting! I really enjoyed this picture. 

Our family had to take our 9-10 year old rescue White Boxer on Monday, August 20, 2018, to the vet to have her euthanized. This picture reminded me of our dog. She would lie down by the door, and look out the door window, until we got home. I'll miss seeing her through the door window whenever we pull up in the driveway. 
This is like a happier version of that one Futurama episode.
My heart :(
OMG he is soooo cuteeeeeeee

Omg that why i hate cat
Titled "Abandoned".  Poor thing.  You've damaged your dog.  ;)
Traumatizing the poor boy. 
I‚Äôve got two dogs both are definitely past the puppy stage but when Mom leaves it‚Äôs all the same, so good luck not crying every day you leave for work
Is that the duck from don't hug me I'm scared
The first time? How many times are you planning to leave your boyfriend exactly?
Omg omg omg

Your door looks exactly like my door.
The cynical part of me wants to believe this was staged by the boyfriend for a cute pic to send to his girlfriend. Which in itself is kinda cute, but for a different reason.
My doggo does that if my Mum or my Sister leaves my flat. It's really sweet, but at the same time I think "I'm right here arsehole, I'm the o e that feeds you!"
Great, thanks for making me sad this morning. 
Awww sweet. That's the sweetest thing ever 
How could you be so cruel?
[deleted]
Wherever someone leaves the house, any of the four of us, the little one sits on the puffy chair next to the window, when he hears the driveway buzzer go off, he barks, then he see's the car, then jumps off the chair and runs to the door and waits, tail wagging and tongue hanging then the door opens and it's like he's greeting a long lost relative gone overseas for 15 years.
"She's never coming back..."- Pupper
Oh my heart....!!!
Aww, what's his name?
This is the first time you've left your boyfriend?
good puppers
This is like Patrick from Spongebob-

‚ÄúWhat do you do when I‚Äôm gone all day?‚Äù

‚ÄúWait for you to come home‚Äù
Tell yourboyfriend to get off his phone and play with him lol.
Awwww
The text on the mobile front page ends at "Today I left him..."

Got super sad. Then I saw the rest and now I'm happy again.

Thanks for the emotional rollercoaster OP, it's way too early for this 
The pup is confused on why you would leave it with a broken hanger on the floor.
Too cute! And he has a teddy gift all ready... <3
Cuteness overload off the charts sweet. What a sweet heart waiting for you to return. Dogs are the best. Unconditional love in its highest form. Beautiful dog. All the best with your new puppy üòä
Is it a Brittany?! I love their tails :)
Every second after the 5th he assumes you're dead and never coming home, but as far as he's concerned he's better off holding out hope that maybe he's wrong.
Awww what a sweetheart!
awwww
I had that sort of problem when I went to visit my dad in Alabama a few days after adopting a new dog, though she thankfully had my mom and five other dogs to keep her company.
Pupper does a heckin wait
Wait...did you leave leave? Or you just started classes and coming back home later?
tell your lounging BF to pick up the clutter and take that box to the garage!
What kind of spaniel is he? King Charles? 
Aweeeeee sitting there with his toy waiting for mum. He already adores you.
My dog is the reason why I missed so many classes. 

Well, him and the margaritas. But mostly him. 
When we go on holiday, my dog goes on holiday to my parents. She sits by the door waiting for us to come back to her. Broke my heart when I was told that. 
Awww :)
Oh poor baby!  He's waiting for you!
She's bored, alone, and worried if you'd ever come back for her. Bring her to class to act as your secretary.
Obviously there‚Äôs only one solution, get some shades, a white walking stick, and a leash for your service puppersüòô
Awwwww that baby misses his Momma!!! So cute.
Aww <3
awwww, hes so friggan cute!!
You guys have a nice place!
Take online classes only!
I work from home and our dog gets so sad when my boyfriend leaves for work. She will nap in front of the door for an hour. Move around and nap elsewhere, usually by me. We play throughout the day. And around 4:30 she‚Äôs back in front of the door, waiting until he gets back at 5. 
I thought this is /r/creepy at first
It‚Äôs DUCKHUNT in real life. Same dog, same duck. 
Nintendo are you sending me subliminal messages? 
That's a broken hanger right there on the floor.
That‚Äôs so cute

Random, but I like those bar chairs. Where did you get them?
Ok
My golden retriever cries whenever we leave or come home, and when we‚Äôre not home he sleeps next to the front door the whole time.
Poor little guy misses you. Pay attention in class and hurry home. 
How do we know that‚Äôs not the pantry you keep the food in?
Ahhh. Loved the picture. (I hate that my dog probably does this when I‚Äôm gone.) BUT I love some of these comments even more. You people crack me up!
tag you're the favorite! 
Wow it‚Äôs funny you mention this because my dog, same one I mentioned, did the same thing for YEARS until literally last night. See, he was always slow and a little lethargic at times, and never liked walks - but a vet tested and found out he had very low thyroid levels. We gave him meds and within 1-2 weeks there was a huuuuuge difference. We tried walking him last night for the first time in months, and he almost ran the whole time and looked so happy!! I don‚Äôt know how female dogs work as far as hormones go, but it may be worth looking into!
UPDATE?
Reddit cut the title on mobile after ‚ÄúToday I left him‚Äù and I was so sad. Glad I checked, though!
I will wait for you play's  poor SeYmore. 
That hanger has lost its head. üôÅ
Omg my heart! 
Man I thought this was a gif and waited way too long for it to start playing.
If it takes forever, I will wait for you
yes very cute, but why havent you left the place in 2 weeks? is everything okay?
You guys know how when you‚Äôre on mobile and you get those popular posts in little scares? This one showed up and when I saw it said, ‚ÄúMy boyfriend and I got a puppy two weeks ago. Today I left him...‚Äù

Hit me with feels fam
I went on a week long trip to visit family once, and had a friend house-sit my Great Dane. He told me the Great Dane spent most of his time lying in the hallway in front of the door to the garage, waiting for me to come through it. I didn't leave home much after that.
So cute !!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
ughh i hate it whenever i see post like this 
it makes me feel gulity
TMW post goes so big, OP has to delete her account 
You must have awesome snacks to stay home for 2 weeks!
Doggo miss her
Took me way too long to notice it's not a video.
You better go home and pet him right now
Quit college 
College isn't worth it. Leave now. 
Wait for kids (if that‚Äôs a plan), they do the same. Lots of times the wife will walk across the street to 7/11 and both kids & the dog look out the window until her return. 
If you bought the dog from a breeder, never buy from them again. Docking tails is horrible.

What kind of dog is that? He looks so cute!
His earsüòç
You gotta drop out now sorry 
OP turn around now!
My heart! üíî
We've had a couple of anxious dogs. And when we leave the house, we say the same thing, so they know we're coming back. Its "Bye, See you soon. Stay"

Our first dog would cheap up the house trying to escape if we didnt. When we put that pattern in place.. house was "untorn"
Love it
Welcome to the world of dog ownership. They take over your life:)

Why would you get a puppy if you're still so young you're in school? The chances of you and boyfriend still being together in the future are slim, so what happens to the dog then?
Pets have no concept of time .. when you go away they cry and howl thinking it will be days or months until they see their owners again :(
Basic photo of a dog waiting his owner. What a surprise 
How many times do you need to say boyfriend?
My cat does that with my son. Every single time he leaves the house üòÇ
You monster!
awww nooo :,(
Sad puppy üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
Not Awwww at all. Dogs are social animals, living and roaming in packs when allowed. This pup is already experiencing loneliness, as the belonging of a human who sees him as their property.  
Get him a companion.  Then you are truly being kind to your pet.
Fabricated backstory for karma. It's just a plain, ordinary and wholly uninteresting picture of a dog.

Hes threatening to hurt the dog if you dont stay with him? That's terrible!
Why are college kids buying dogs a thing? I'm asking for the overweight blue heeler stuck in my daughter's college apt.
We don't deserve dogs! I'm sure somebody else has already said this but it warrants a repeat...
Not to be dramatic, but if someone sent me this , no matter what I was doing, I would get home ASAP. Who needs college when your doggo is waiting for you 
What‚Äôs he staring at?
Get reddy to hire a Doggy Psychiatrist to deal with the Trauma.

Poor dog he's going to be damaged for life.

This is evidence of a dad realizing that he can never out-do a mother‚Äôs love. 

Alternate caption: If this was the game of Life, this realization would be one of those Life chips you collect at the end  and it would be worth $100,000. Men who trulyyyyy realize it get 300,000 for being a homie. I will monitor all games or Life from here on out to determine who is a homie. You‚Äôre welcome for this selfless sacrifice. 
He better pay well cuz u ain't getting no job besides playing with him üòÇ
Are you sure he isn‚Äôt blind?
What's this fellas instagram? He better have one
Get a real kid you degenerates
The fuck its tail cut!?
And now I‚Äôm ugly crying at worküò≠üò≠
tend.to.him. :) 
Where is mommy?
Could never get a puppy without getting him a friend too.
Maybe he is not miss her he just want to get out !!!
im just sain  
So out of idle curiosity. If you break up...who gets the puppy?
Nice try, there was probably a mailman outside. Next time think that the puppy can‚Äôt take a photo from behind. If the camera was at the paws it may have been a little believable.

it better be a rescue or youre part of the problem
Your boyfriend fooled you, the fact, there's someone behind that door (another girl maybe), your dog just waiting to open that door and ready to grab her. 
You are kidding right?...Giving a puppy free reign of you apartment?  Is he trained to use the litter box, so he doesn't lift his leg on your furniture, or crap on the carpet?  Has he been trained only to chew on his toys and not your shoes?  Is he crate trained so he doesn't feel anxious and lonely, and ends up howling until the you get home? Is there someone to come in and check on him, if you are away for more than six hours? You can always take evening classes on how to raise a puppy.  Otherwise, I think you might get tired of this and poor puppy could be looking like this on the other side of a shelter door.  
I would quit  school. Seriously.
Interesting.  I, too, have a new puppy.  The one thing I notice missing from this picture is the pile of shit that this little asshole didn't expel from his body when he was outside three minutes ago.
Who is gonna get it when you guys break up? You will prob say fuk it and put it in a shelter wont you?
If only our wives were that loyal. Lol. 
I feel kinda bad for the dog. Does your boyfriend have time to play with him? Maybe doggie day care?
