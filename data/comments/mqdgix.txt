That must make you feel amazing! How lucky you both are to have each other.
That is the sweetest thing I've seen today. Thank you.
Next time put your hand down just in front of her nose. She will smell you and wake up.
This touched ma soul. So precious.
Please post more of these and never stop posting
What kinda doggo is this? Looks like a sweet little lamb
I always think I’m a whole gangsta until these videos bring on the one solo tear.
[deleted]
My heart! The way she immediately got up to see you gives me life
The way she’s curled up sleeping by the chair leg - I cry
I'd drive more carefully everyday just so this pup can lick me in the face
OH MY GOD. Grace us with her name, what a heckin stunning baby 😍
That's forking adorable! And she's beautiful!
Nub and wiggle butt, is she an Aussie?
Totally made my day !
Do you use sign language to communicate things like "walk" and "sit"?
Ummmmmmm where can I overnight treats? 

1000000% r/aww content
The cuteness meter is reaching critical levels!
Oh my heart.....
This is so pure 🥺
My sweet old pit girl has gone deaf, and (I'm pretty sure) mostly blind. It's so funny how excited she gets when she suddenly "discovers" you, when you've been there the whole time. My favorite, though, it's when she follows the others' lead and will start baking like mad. She looks so embarrassed when she suddenly realizes the others are gone and she's making a fuss all by herself.
She looks like Twig from the show Hilda!
Currently working out of state, it’s been over 30 days since I’ve seen my pups, can’t tell you how much I appreciate this!!! That’s one sweet baby!
Thank you
Isn’t that a Australian Shepherd that was born deaf or blind/sometimes both because the breeding of two Merle’s?
the wiggliest marshmallow
This is so cute and made my day so much better, thank you!
I’m watching I Am Sam, and then I see this. Idk how much more I can cry.
Looks like someone tried to breed two merles.   They usually end up deaf or blind or both.  

 I have a 50lb Aussie Corgi mix that was the product of breeding two merled.  She has a janky eye and a merle patch on her face.  Someone dumped her and luckily a rescue picked her up.
Totally worth getting peed on.
Nice
Ill just die of cutness
That is a keeper. So cute.
She's such a lovely girl ❤️
My heart melted ..
Awww she so cute
It seems one less sense means more room for love
OH MY GOD SHE's SO WIGGLY
Serious question: why is it every time I see a deaf dog they have white fur? I may be oblivious to other circumstances but on the internet it always appears to be some white dog.
Oh my gosh, that’s the most precious thing I’ve ever seen. What kind of pupper is she?
Aww! I loved seeing this, OP! It is so important that people know not to touch deaf dogs when they are sleeping, since they get sleep startle so easily. (Tapping the floor next to them or turning the light on and off often works too, in case anyone is curious).
r/MadeMeSmile
This, this is why I continue existing
I tried to adopt a deaf dog earlier this year who looked similar- she wound up going to a home with a deaf family member, so that was a good fit. So adorable!
Albino chromosomes in breeding often results in deafness.
u/SaveVideo
what a sweet girl!!
This is so pure. She is precious
 Be still my heart!
Such a cutie 😍
This is the fuzziest most desperate little ball of love I've ever seen
Oh my god OP please make an Instagram for this pup and reply with the username. I’m in love, and as someone else said, please post more of these and never stop posting.
I know when humans lose a sense the other ones supposedly become stronger. If a def dogs nose got even stronger, an you imagine the things it could smell? 

Hey did you smell that? A bee just farted in Maine.
Aw she is cute but I feel bad because she’s most likely that way due to irresponsible breeding. That’s probably also why she has white fur and blue eyes. Not blaming you, OP. it’s just unfortunate.
He’s little wiggle butt is so cute
Oh man that's so adorable.
she’s perfect 💘
I really love this.. you make that puppy's day!
OMGOODNESS 😍🥰
What a cute little fluffball!
Honestly I'm surprised she can't feel it when you walk in the door. Like by the vibration of the floor.
Try making vibrations from the entry so you don't startle it awake. A cane you can tap on the floor, even just a broom handle will do. They'll eventually learn to recognize and associate it with you coming home. It's a gentler way of making them aware of your presence at a distance even when they can't hear, see or smell you.
my old girl has finally lost her hearing.  So I get the same thing every day.  I get to lay down next to her on the bed and wake her up gently.  It's my favorite thing every day.
Absolutely adorable! I have an 8 year old pit (Annie, my bestest girl) who i rescued two years ago whose heart, soul, and mind are JUST like this but her body is not :(  I'm going to have to put her down this week because of lung cancer, large tumor with more and more restricted breathing.

Seeing this makes me so happy and then sad because her brother and sister both know she wants to and tries to play but just no longer can. She's the sweetest thing you could ever know and has the kindest soul ever. So kind and loving it's not fair, but life isn't. The past two years have been brutal and it turns out SHE rescued me.

I hope your puppy lives 20+ years!
Dad your home!
The fact this doesn’t have sound upsets me to a level that no human has ever reached.
What a sweet little baby!!!!
u/savevideo
The love these little creatures give us is truly a gift
My hearttt😫😫🥺🥺🥺
So pure 🥰
She looks like a tiny little fawn all curled up. 
What a sweethear! <3 Thank you for sharing her, please feel free to share her a bunch more. Or if you have some kind of instagram for her maybe? She's so sweet!
This brightened my day👏🏼
Literally the best damn thing I have seen all day. 🐶❤️
thank you for posting this. had to put down my 15 year old border collie mix a month ago. very hard.

this video reminds me of the good days
Holy heck she's adorable
Deaf guy here:

Adorable dog. Clearly loves you. 

Train it to know what flashing lights mean! You show the dog the light switch and make the connection over many times and then when you want it’s attention all you have to do is either stomp ya foot (vibration) or flick the light switch a couple times.
The prettiest little eyes
Lil pee on the knee
Im glad it's innocent excitement, and not excitement with murderous intent.
If she had antlers, she reminds me of the deer-fox Twig from Hilda!
Just had one of the worst days ever. Seeing this put a smile on my face. What an adorable puppers. Give em some pets for me please.
When i see something like this or my dogs in some special moments my fucking will for life just skyrockets. Such innocent creatures. How some people treat them is just sickening to me. I would do prison time for my dogs.
She looks like a little fae creature you found while walking in a magic forest. Those eyes are what really sell it.
I was house/dog sitting for a family with a deaf and blind boxer (’Ipo). To wake her up in the morning I would leave a treat 6” from her nose and she would freak out with loves and kisses. Whenever I was gone for an extended period of time due to work, ’Ipo would sleep by the wall of the house so she could feel the vibration of the garage door and, again, freak out with loves and kisses.
this made me smile so big
Such beautiful eyes on the good girl! She is soooo adorable
My elderly dog does this also it’s so cute
Australian Shepherd? She is absolutely precious. ❤️
She is so sweet !
She's adorable
oh my heart
OMG I wish this video had sound!!! So cute!!!
I love, and want your pup!!! She’s an angel
WHY AM I CRYING???
Puppy: Are you ready?

Kids: Yes puppy!

Puppy: I can't hear you

Kids: Yes puppy!

Puppy: I can't hear you

Kids: Yes puppy!

Puppy: I can't hear you

Kids: Yes puppy!

Puppy: I can't hear you

Kids: Yes puppy!

...
We will never deserve puppers
huh?

OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
Wow what a cutie 😊
💋💋♥️♥️💋💋♥️♥️♥️😘😘 what a cute little fuzz butt.
"Wait....What? OMG YOUR HOME YOUR HOME YOUR HOME YOUR HOME" Lol I love it.
Having lives with a deaf dog, get a vibration collar. It helps to teach them whenever it vibrates- they look at you.   Then you can use hand signals for other commands.
Such a cutie, I love how happy she is to see you 😭
What I Imagine The Pup Is Thinking: ITS MY HUMAN! ITS MY HUMAN! MY HUMAN IS HOME!
Thank you for taking care of her.  She's blessed.  :)
when my boy lost his hearing, i used to put my hand in front of him so he would get my scent. i was always afraid touching him might scare him too much. but the way they get so excited for you is just the best ♥️♥️
I'm so jealous of dogs ability to fall asleep in 10 seconds, then be in 5th gear in 1.
This is the wholesome content that I am here for.
this is so sweet
This ❤️
I freaking love this sooo much
Having a dog has improved my quality of life in so many ways
I wish there was audio! I want to hear if she squeaks in delight.
Aww baby girl!
☺️❤️ thank you for sharing this , thats so adorable ❤️☺️
Cute. You might find this evolves a little over time. We’ve had several Deaf dogs (and use ASL as our primary language at home anyway) and what always surprised me most was one would always know when I was home even if he was sleeping on a different floor or room. 

Either he has a really good sense of smell or I need to shower more, hahaha. Vibrations and lights tip him off too but any change in smell pulls him right out of a deep sleep more often than not.
Her little face!!!
She's beautiful!
I can’t
This just cured my depression
That puppy looks like the tiniest little foal
That dog is FUCKING Adorable!
Looks like a little lamb lying there curled in a ball
Oh look at those blue eyes!  What breed(s) is she?
Oh, those eyes! 😍😍😍
She’s a cutie!
that puppy is vibrating with joy.  very nice
By far the cutest thing I have seen today
Love the sweetness. Thx for sharing, and caring.
Wow that dog loves you.
Ooohhhhhh my!! That’s so precious!! Look at those eyes!!!
I need more of this puppy stat
What a great poochie! I wish I could get that excited about *anything*!
I love her
This is so sweet! Thank you for posting. I needed to see this today.
Awww that is the cutest! What a sweetheart!
omg so precious 🥺
Omg what a sweety ❤️
Super cute
Adorable🥰
Oooohh! My heart! 🥲❤️ So precious!
How sweet. I love her happy excitement.
I thought it was a goat.

I love you my fellow human and I love your dog. I love everyone's dog. I really love my dog. Here is the free helpful awards from reddit I was gifted.  You deserve more
Awww she's so cute. I love her eyes. 😍
Adorable!!!! ❤️
the fucking reddit player literally won't play past 5 seconds. god when is reddit going to fix this shit
Omg the wiggles!!! Don’t stop!!!!
Your puppy is Beautiful, what is her name?
She’s beautiful ❣️
This deserves 50k upvotes.
Which breed of dog is she? She’s gorgeous 💕
I watched this 1 million times...Then 1 million more in slo-mo.
Wow, that is one cute pup.
The littlest piglet!! XD
That was awesome. Thanks for sharing.
Give that good puper another pet for me.
Aw she looks like a little goat laying there
You gotta be careful with deaf dogs. You have to train them differently, a stern voice isn't going to mean anything to them. I have a friend with a deaf dog who wasn't trained properly and he's become destructive. He "dug" a hole through the wall of her house.
Darn it, who’s cutting onion.
She piddled on your jeans! That is true love, I know because my Aussie does it to me lmao
Omg she absolute bebby 😭
What an absolute sweetheart ❤️❤️❤️
Do deaf dogs bark weird?
Aww I lover her! So sweet
I love her
My last dog was older and wouldn't hear me come home. She would often wait right in front of the door so you had to open it really slowly so she wouldn't get hurt by it.... Then if she wasn't by the door is have to call her softly or touch her softly so as not to scare her.... The greeting when she realized i was home was what made my day....i miss her
Whoa... that look like a snow fox.

So cute.
That just made me cry
Omg. Is that an Aussie?
This is so pure
Well done.   So many just end up startled.
I wish I could wake up and get moving like that.
This is so beautiful, such an innocent and beautiful puppy! 🥺🥺🥺❤️
Awwww, she looks like a baby deer when sleeping!!
I’m not crying, you are.
Real Love.
She is cute
AWWWWW
What a cutie patootie!
My 18 year old guy is similar. He sometimes feels the vibration when I walk in and he acts like a teenager! Beautiful little one you have!
Such a sweet little face
Omg so cute 😭😭😭
Dogs really are special. From sleeping to "OMG I LOVE YOU!!! I MISSED YOU!!!" In 0.1 seconds
You can tell she is greatly loved...
This is the best video! How wonderful that you appreciate the gift of seeing your pups excitement. You’ve made my day. Miss mine so much. Keep sharing love the little snow-kissed nose!!
What kind of breed is that ?
The Lethal White Merle…

The result of breeding two Blue Merle dogs.
I never want to not see this ever again.
Thanks 4 sharing your beautiful puppy with us. God bless the little thing, & you too.
I have a cat who lost her hearing and she's really loud when she notices us.
Such a pretty girl.
I have a def chihuahua that does the same thing! So adorable.
Bro, post more videos of this absolute specimen of a puppy or I will stalk your account like the moon stalks the sun, summer stalks the winter, and dmx stalked crack cocaine
My heart just melted from watching this
Aw. Are you going to teach a dog sign language?

Btw deaf here.
See? That’s why animals are pretty much better than humans 🥲 that’s just fucking adorable
Oh my heart. I can't even.
Of COURSE this video doesn’t have sound 😂
Awew
I love her
How do commands work with her? Is it completely gesture based?
Honestly thought she was a baby lamb at first
I wish I had that much energy when I wake up
Now, that's a good little fluff baby. 🤍  Rub her tummy for me?
Oh my. It looks like a fawn. I need a video every day, please.
F*ck you, get my upvote!
Probably has the bestest sleeps.
So cute. I adopted a 12 year old deaf cat. You have to come up with new ways of communicating. For instance, I had to tap or stomp the floor to get her attention. She also was looooud, probably because she was trying to hear herself and still couldn't. Very sweet cat, very scared of cars. She couldn't jump much, so often I let her sit in the garden under flowers, her favourite place to be, and couldn't jump my fences to escape. I miss that cat, cancer got her a year after I adopted her.
Her eyes are beautiful! I actually thought she was a lamb when she was lying down for some reason
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
i am genuinely about to cry over this purity
She must take peaceful naps since she can’t be woken up by noise.
So my morning started well thanks to you.
Sweet baby angel 💕
Is she home alone when you're not there? I can't imagine how lonely and scary that must be if that's the case..
Blowing on their fur will wake them up softer.
My deaf and blind Jack Russel would look straight at you when you walked in, almost as if he knew you were there, I’d go over and stroke his head and he’d viciously attack my hand every time.
Honesty... I'd die for your dog.
u/farmercurtis my heart!!!
So cute! If you ever feel the need for it, if you want a more gentle wake up, try blowing on ears/fur or rubbing a paw. Signed a deaf person w a deaf cat. Lol. 

Also, start those hand signals ASAP, it’ll be like your superpower together!
Whenever I go visit my parents who have my old lady deaf dog, I put my hand in front of her nose. I love seeing it wiggle as she smells me, wakes up, then the excitement that follows
This is 52nd on the top of all time in just 9 hours holy shit
You made me smile for the first time in ages and I can’t thank you enough. Your puppy is so beautiful and precious- please share a belly rub for being so darn cute!
For a moment I wished there was audio, then I figured I should be okay with enjoying it silently, like the puppy.
@u/downloadmp4
Upvote for karma please
WOW! Heart warming, thanks for sharing.
Wow, looks so lovely
My dog lost her hearing almost a yr ago, we used to blow air at her to wake her up but not these days as she sleeps like the dead (gave us a couple of heart attacks sometimes as shaking didnt work, literally “dead” asleep and even a treat right next to her nose doesn’t wake her up ). 

Nowadays we use 3 levels to wake her up : 1) boop her nose, 2) rub her nose and lastly, 3) POKE HER BUTT LIKE KAKASHI DID TO NARUTO. 

That one works the best!

P.S. luckily when she was a pupper, me and dad unconsciously taught her hand signals and we now use that to communicate with her

P.S.S she’s 15/16 this year, still runs around like a bat outta hell 😂
Omg I'm in love. Bless you both
I am having a short day and this video is a bibe
This is the best sub now bcos of this video
Tail is gone so naturally, the entire body must wiggle to show proper excitement! This is one of the Laws of Dog
I will never not upvote something like this.
Tbh she totally deserves all teh love and attention. Take care :p
not archived yet :)
Omg!!!! I want her!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Omg!!!! You are so lucky to have this Angel!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰
Beautiful. Maybe there is something else that can spark her senses? Like a spray of your perfume? Or something to vibrate the floor??  Could help as well
When you touched her she was like wait whhhaa  FRIEND FRIEND (*^o^)人(^o^*)
Omg that’s so cute
She's so beautiful
I had 2 Boxer/Mastiff mixes, Kaine and Sasha. Kains attention span was a speak of dust in a windstorm, nonexistent. But my Sasha, she was the nurturing type. I used to foster baby kittens for a friend that at the time, was breeding Bengals and Sphinx. Every now and then there would be a kitten that wasn't thriving like it should and I would get those kittens and give them some one on one assistance. Sasha was my helper. She would come every morning when it was "time to feed the baby". She would wait patiently while I would feed them, and she would proceed to clean them up...needless to say, I would need to give a second little clean up because Sasha had the slobber. But it was sweet to watch. She would follow the little kitties around and make sure they didn't get into anything, but if they did, she would get them and bring them to me or if one would get into something she couldn't get it out of, she would come and get me to help them out. She was such a good mommy. I fostered one kitten that was born with a severe skeletal birth defect. We knew that the baby's mortality was going to be extremely short but I took her anyway so she could feel the love and warmth for the short time she would live. Sasha knew this kitten was different and she would be extra gentle with her. Needless to say the little kitten passed away one night peacefully nuzzled next to me while we swept. When Sasha came in the room that morning, she was ready to do her mommy duties and I had to tell her that the baby was gone. That she had died. Sasha laid her big head on the bed, sniffed the little blanket I had wrapped the kitten in and actually cried, which in turn got my waterworks going. Sasha pouted for several days. I took a short break from fostering for a little bit. While I understand the position these kittens are in when I get them, I'm prepared if they don't make it. So, the break was more for Sashas sake. My Kaine and Sasha went over the Rainbow Bridge several years ago and I still miss them dearly. I did get another special needs kitten with the same birth defect that the other kitten had. Only his wasn't as severe, it was very touch and go for the first 6 months of his life but Archer is now 3 years old and thriving and he's my little mischief maker.
U/devinmburgess - what kind of dog is this? It’s such a beautiful story I want to share, but I know everyone will ask me haha 😆
Thank fully you did not chain her up. I hate people when they do that.
Awe!! Thank you for adopting her, I've seen it first hand, special needs pups get passed over and over. Your a great human OP and i hope you have a long and loving life together ❤❤❤
I don't think I've ever seen so many awards on a post before
Awww precious girl, she's so lovely 😍
Damn it!!!! How are you going to be the person that makes this hard headed, stubborn and all around a-hole old man get all sensitive and squishy🤦🏼‍♂️. Awe, that is just completely adorable. And her innocent excitement, could not have been worded better nor felt any better either. Thanks for the smile today, it was appreciated.
That is magical
This is just too freaking special. How lucky the owner is
Precious little girl 😍😍
I thought this was a goat
Please don’t do this. You can really stress out a deaf dog this way. I had a few growing up and the best way is to hold out your hand for them to smell, they’ll wake up.
YOU’RE HEEEEERRRRRRRRE!
D’awwwww
what kind of dog is it
Oh how sweet!  I do hope she isn't home alone most of the day, that would be so sad.
In honor of the deaf pup, this video will not have sound.  

Seriously though, what a sweet and wonderful welcome she gives you. 🤟🏾
Is there a reason a lot of deaf animals have white fur/hair?
You are an amazing person.
I like that the video has no sound.  It's like it's from her perspective.
This made a man cry with how sweet and innocent it is. I thought you should know.

Oh, sweet puppy ❤️

As a fellow double merle owner, I wake mine up by either tapping whatever he’s sleeping on (ie rattling his dog bed or the couch cushion) or stomping the ground he is sleeping on, or putting my hand by his nose. Just to prevent any anxiety from sudden touches.

Sometimes they are sleeping so hard it takes them a few moments to wake up, but mine actually checks on me super frequently.

Also... you will never have to worry about fireworks or vacuums, hahaha. 

There is a little bit of a challenge figuring out how to train despite the disabilities, but my dog is the bestest of best dogs, and I wish you all the happiness with this fluffer.
I also want to raise a puppy, but my wife doesn’t like dogs!
I have a question, how did you train her? Like since you can’t use audio like reinforcement did you use a spray bottle?
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲cutest ever
i’m fr crying
This is so beautiful it made me cry! I can't handle the cuteness
its so precious i think i might cry
She is so cute tho! ❤️

AWWWWWWW!  He's just so darn cute!  That sleeping position makes my heart hurt, it's just tooooo cute.
Oh my heart
This is the best.
Broo that is so adorable!
Awwwwwe..... 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
We lost a 2-year old sweet puppy identical to yours (but different color) last year. Her reaction is so pure and full of love. It brought back good memories. This made my day. Thank you.
I’m so jealous. Omg. 😑
We demand more Evie content!
I’m crying!!!!! What a perfect angel!!!!! 😍😭
Is that an Aussie? I have 3! She is sooooo sweet!
Can you upload again with sound?
She's precious
So smale n precious her
Bless, what a sweet baby 😭
I want to try it... 🥺
This melts my heart to see her so excited. You better Make her as happy as a pupper can be!

Edit;
Also want to notate how gorgeous that sweet baby is! 😭😭😭
I would wake my deaf, older dog up by putting a treat under her nose.
so freaking adorable
Those eyes are awesome looking
She's so adorable!
That is so cute.
I thought she was a little goat!
Looks like that fire wolf pup from Adventure Time when she's all curled up.
oh! my heart
That is the sweetest thing!! 🤗
0 to 100 in an eighth of a second?
Oh god, my fuckin heart
Oh my god my heart just exploded into a million pieces and I don’t know how I’m even able to type right now. That’s so pure. I wish you both so much love and happiness.
That is the sweetest thing I have ever seen. What a happy dog! Both of y'all are so lucky to have each other!
That honestly was one of the sweetest things I have seen. It actually brought a tear to my eye. Thank you for sharing.
When I was nine, my dog was about 13/14. Had been my best friend my entire life. I would sneak into the room each morning to let him outside and feed him, each time trying to be as quiet as possible to sneak up on him without waking him up. Finally, one day, I snuck in without waking him up. 9 year old me never realized what it would actually mean when he didn’t wake up.    Make sure you cherish every moment!!
my heart just melted!
I blow on my deaf puppers face to wake her up without startling her. :)

Edit: she is deaf, not dead.
Looks excited enough to pee on you
This video has no sound just like your puppy
She looks like a little baby goat!
How sweet
My heart is filled with such warmth
That is such a sweet wake up. We have a 90 pound Aussie and whenever we have to wake him up, no matter how we try to do it, it’s like he things the world is ending and he needs to get up ASAP. He’ll flail his legs around, kick shit and knock into the wall. He’s crazy but we love him
That's awesome! And those eyes are an amazing blue!! What a beautiful relationship.
She’s soooo cute
How dare you not include sound on this
🥰
Love is blind.... I mean deaf...... :) awesome
a fox👍🏼
So cute.  The only time I can remember being that excited immediately after waking up is as a kid Christmas morning.
So beautiful
Not to be dramatic, but I would die for your puppy.
Adorable!!
That's sweet. I'm surprised she doesn't smell you before you get close to her
Awww, that little butt wiggle!
I have a mini aussies puppy as well! What's it like  training a deaf pup? Just be very difficult but keep up the great work!
Good puppy.
Why many deaf cats/dogs are white and have blue eyes?
That is a cute puppy, i love when they’re so exited. It’s like they have so much happy but too small bodies
We have a deaf dog too, a little 20 lb terrier mix of some sort (I'd put money on her being Rat Terrier/Chihuahua) that my wife adopted when she was living in Korea.

We got a second dog awhile after she moved in with me (a giant Great Pyrenees mix) and she takes a lot of cues from him. She actually responds to his bark, I think because she can feel it since he's such a big dog with a loud deep bark that even I can feel sometimes.
Oh Yes hooman! That scratches are so great!
You riled up the fluffy baby. How cute
This turned me into an absolute puddle.
Oh my goodness she is beautiful
I believe that dog would ride in a bjorn and go with me everywhere
This is so precious! I love how peaceful she looks while she sleeps, and she gets so excited when she wakes up. D’aawww. My heart has been stolen.
Thats so precious
🥺 FUCK THAT’S CUTE. I miss my doge. She’s not dead, just moved in with another family member.
Does she make normal Aussie puppy sounds or anything different? 

Any social interactions of interest? I've been around a lot of deaf older dogs, but never a dog who was deaf from birth.

Does she react to vibration from Thunder or the vacuum? 

Cool dog, enjoy.
Let her sleep.
This makes my cry its so precious!!
For some reason she brought tears in my eyes Idk if you can hold yourself everytime you see her reaction like this
Love it, dogs are the best
I am surprised it cannot feel or smell you coming from your footsteps. Maybe just because it is too young? Also how would you get your dogs attention to give it a command if it is not paying attention to you and looking at you directly?
Aww so cute
I WANT ONE I LOVE HER HOW DARLING
Welp, I think I’m in love with you now. Thanks for sharing all this sweetness
I thought it was a baby goat at first and it was just as adorable
Oh she's just the pee wee ist of them all!!!
Is her name piglet?
As cute as this is, aren’t you supposed to let a sleeping puppy sleep?
r/awwakeup will love this!! :D
I need sound!!!!!!!!!!!
I watched this three (thousand)  times and I conclude after all that research that this is a little lamb,  not a puppy!   Return her,   I will come get her for you to exchange.
This just made my day! Thank you so much!! 💕
I love her. And, she is SO lucky to have u.
Nope this didn’t faze me 

*tears continue to run down face*
Aaaawwwwwwww
I've got a deaf aussie mix as well, it's really sweet waking him up.
You can wake her up even more gently be letting her sniff your finger. That's what I do to one of my old pups that doesn't hear
Im not crying youre crying!
Beautiful dog
Soooooo freaking adorable!!  Love it
Don't lie! That is a piglet!!!

Kidding aside, that is one cut puppy!
We need longer videos! Next time, build up the anticipation and film from the door before you walk around to find her. Better yet, start from your drive home 🤣💙
My girlfriend has a harlequin Great Dane.  Deaf but so smart.  Beautiful coloring on your pup!
Stop! That sweet, angel!
r/ntbdbiwdfta
That dog has the eyes of Kuato!!!
I'm not crying

 you're crying
God I love dogs
Aw you woke her up from a nice dream to an even better reality
This made my day🥺🥺
My eyes!! So sweet
She looks like an albino fox.. she is just too cute!💕
CUTE！
This warms my heart!
Very cute. Consider getting a smell article so they can more easily tell when you are home. Could be something you keep in a bag in car and then open up and bring into house with you. If you want them to know when you’re home. Up to you.
Oh my gaaaaawd.... this is adorable
This is so precious!! We need another wake up video please!
Dogs > Humans. 
That’s pure love coming from this lovely puppy.
🥺🥺
🥰
I just cried 😭 yep a lot! I cried a lot 😭 I'm still crying
My heart
Was hoping for sound :/ does she make noises when she notices it’s you? My one dog whines the whole time! And I love it
r/mademesmile
I'm crying awwwww
Omg 😭😭😭 So precious!!!!
So adorable 😊
She is so precious!!!
I think she just released a little "excitement" on your leg..
My heart.... I can’t.
 This is what makes life worth living
you dont crate a puppy while youre not home? thats some confidence in that pup
My heart 🥺🥰
Omg that's so cute
How doesn’t it feel you, twinkle toes?
The genetics that give dogs and cats white coats and blue eyes are often ssociated with a trait for deafness as well.
I wish I could wake up like this in the morning! Such pure, beautiful energy...
My dog is 15 and he went deaf fairly recently. It takes a good 10 seconds or so between he sniffs my hand and when he starts doing elderly frolicking.
im gonna cry💖
Omg she's beautiful
Pooches are the best!!!
So freaking cute!
Oh my god she's so cute.
Awww, she is so cute. I would love to adopt a dog such as her.
As someone that just had to put my dog down, this absolutely made my day!
You need to refinish those floors!
So cute
So freaking cute
This is so precious
Make sure to keep your scents the same. Dont wanna confuse her by smelling like coffee and old spice deodorant 99% of the time and suddenly switch to an Armani cologne. I'm sure she'll be quick to realize it's you but still, it's like waking up from a nap and hearing a different voice in your house before you realize it's your husband with a cold.
Those eyes!
Pm
That puppy looks just like a lamb.
Top tier post
How did you potty train her?
Oh my gosh that is the sweetest thing ever
Awesome doggo!!!
I’m surprised she doesn’t feel the vibrations of you moving
Thanks for sharing! It's so nice to know that this little creature that would not survive in the wilds is alive and happy thanks to you. This brings joy!
my heart 😭💓
My doggo is deaf as well and I love waking her up by putting my hand under her nose and letting her sniff my scent. She's the cutest. Your little one is gorgeous as well, I wish her a long and healthy life!
Awww this makes me cry
❤
Awww I would imagine having a deaf dog would be quite troublesome when you can't find her or when she does something bad like chasing your last chickens and ultimately killing them
Prettyyy😺😺😺😺
Cutest reaction ever. Love it.
This is adorable 😍
awww. I do that with my old girl now that she's deaf haha
Warning! Extreme Cuteness Ahead!
Absolutely love this post!!!
Seeing his joy was touching.
Awww that’s so precious
Made my day!
When I was a kid our dog went deaf, just from old age. If somebody stomped on the floor she could feel the vibrations, and would look around for whoever was waving for her. She also knew hand signs for speak and whisper, and roll over. She was a good dog ;)
I’m not crying 🥲
We had a deaf dalmatian when I was growing up and we never knew how she knew when we came home. One day when I was home sick with a cold, I was lying down on the couch watching a movie when I heard my mom's car pull up. This other dog we had heard her car, ran to the door, turned around, and jumped on the deaf dog. The dalmatian saw the other dog run to the door and ran after her to help greet my mom.
I come home on my lunch break each day and will sometimes find my old girl still fast asleep on the couch. I gently press on the couch cushion to wake her, and she’ll give this big exaggerated stretch while I give her belly scratches.
Gorgeous
from 0 to love instantly
Part of me would be worried not being able to find her if she finds a nice hiding spot.
Omg I want your dog 🤩
I read you're supposed to wake them up by scent, by putting your hand in front of their nose. That way you don't startled them. Or maybe that's blind dogs? Very cute puppy by the way!
No sound makes sense actually.
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!!
Beautiful love!
That's a cute little goat!
Adorable
Oh my gawsh!!! You have to give us more!!!
AWWWWWWWWWWW
Deaf dogs are honestly the purest souls.
Wow, I asked everyone in the whole world and they said they love this dog.
How beautiful! Thank you, I needed this today. She is such a blessing.
Oh man, I’ve been having a rough couple of days but this made me happy. I miss greeting my dog when I would get home from work.
What a precious, beautiful little girl.  What breed is she?
Oh my God
The greatest!
Wow this is amazing.
My little guy was also born deaf. I love seeing him get startled when he doesn’t know I’m home yet. I believe all his other senses are elevated from it though - we just use hand signals for communicating and he just keeps an eye on me and is super responsive.
She is so cute.💙💙💙
This sweet pupper looks like a little lamb
Awww!!  She looks like a little lamb!!  Very sweet! ❤️
He’s so calm for having been left alone! My 6 month old puppy would be crying from the moment I left the apartment.
Humans don't deserve animals. (I'm talking as a whole, to my knowledge this person is worthy of animal)
So cute! She may also be blind or become blind they often come hand in hand. Definitely a no touch wake up is a good next level to avoid startles!
Aww! Mine is like that too!

I have to wake her for her mid evening potty break and every time, she just rolls back over reaching for my hands to pet her.

She's a sweetheart!
Mad because there’s no audio lol
I have a senior dog (17yrs old) that is partially blind/deaf & I do this to him sometimes when I get home, he’s always excited to see me! The amount of loyalty dogs have is unbelievable.
What breed of dog is this??
That is precious!
Awe
I have a deaf dog and he lets me sleep in on weekends by not barking at every sound outside, I also wake mine by tapping him between the shoulder blades
🥺🥺my heart.
That’s got to be the cutest thing ever
She looks like a baby goat!
My heart 🥺💗
Aw she looks like she's moving at 15 frames per second
Awwwww.. Just overloaded with love. That's amazing x
❤️
That brings such joy to my heart.
Not to be dramatic but I would DIE for her.
Those blue eyes!! Beautiful puppy!
That is pure love
Precious ❤
Fuck! My heart! Aaargh!
looks like a furniture lamb
My dad owned a deaf terrier named Patches, this looks adorable 🥰
Goddammit, right in the feels.
💛
They need another little dog to keep them company :)
My heart.....thank you for sharing. What a precious baby.
Hi! I recommend getting a second dog! I had a deaf dog that passed last year. Last few years there was a second dog around. Those 2 really completed each other lol. Now days we can't mention her name because the other dog gets really sad. Dogs are so amazing
Ok, this made me cry and totally made my day!!!!
Major uWu
How precious 😍
Imagine waking up and the first thing you see it's your hooman and then gives you pets
My big fluffy 170lb lazy St. Bernard doesn't even notice when I come inside our loud door from the garage because he is snoring so loud on the landing. I can usually walk right over him without him when noticing... Pretty sure he'd sleep right through a burglary. 🙄 Some guard dog he is lol.
Awesome pup by the way o/p!
The pupper is cute whos for with blue eyes love the combo
What a sweet little girl you have! Give her extra scritches and kisses tonight, because she’s worth it! 🥲
Little lammy!
Why are his eyes so pink? Legit question.
I legit thought it was a little lamb first.
Deaf Puppy is probably the coolest band name ever.
That's gotta feel good.
Omg how could this be any cuter
Legit thought it was a tiny albino deer!
Too cute. I let my deaf dog smell my hand to wake up when I come home. Enjoy you cute dog.
She so beautiful!!! You can tell she gets a lot of love.
What breed?
I love dogs, they are the best
*Insert Kylo Ren "more" gif here*
She’s beautiful
A Vibe Artist
Dogs are such wholesome creatures
OMG!!! She's beautiful!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Omg I love her!!!!!!!
the way it sleeps makes it look like a baby goat :D
WHO’S CHOPPING ONIONS IN HERE!!! ❤️
That's so cute 🥺
This is probably the cutest dog I have ever seen in my entire life
Omg so adorable! What a love bug! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰. Thank You for sharing this Beautiful Fur Baby, She’s so lucky to have a Momma like You! Heartwarming.
Must be nice to have floors that don't squeak.
THIS IS SO CUTE!
What a lil sweetie ..❤️❤️❤️what kind? Thanks for posting made my day
My dog [Balu](https://i.imgur.com/R1cNxTs.jpg) does the same thing! Also deaf. 

Makes for a really deep sleeping dog, lil shit can sleep anywhere.

I also love sneaking up behind him and scaring the shit out of him
She's so cute 😭
Such a sweet baby! She sure loves you! ❤️
What breed of pup is she? I looked through the comments but cannot figure it out!!
Your puppy is precious 😍 God Bless Her. What's her name? Was she born deaf? What's her name? She is beautiful ❤🐕 sweetheart
Awww she's such a cutie!
Adorable but as others have said you might want to wake the little guy up more gently. 

I’m no dog expert but my first thought was that he was going to have a heart attack.
A deaf puppy is something I never knew I needed until now
I want to die a little less now thank you for showing me  you’re adorable dog ;-;
It’s been a rough day... I needed that
Thank you for this. Just the best. I'm going to watch it when I'm in a bad mood. How can it not make you happy.
I've got a legit question. Why do most deaf animals I see look the same? Like, white fur and the same kind of pale skin.
does she bark?
Aww this is really sweet:)
I’m glad the lil pup has a good home ☺️
This is awesome, and she probably never barks.
Blue Eyes, white Dog
Awwh she's so stinking cute, how long you had her?
White dogs are more likely to be deaf.
She is so gorgeous and loving! Just wondering do you know if she is deaf and predominantly white because both her parents were Merle?
So so precious, a little bitty butterball
That dog has peaked with happiness and will never be able to top that moment
Super cute!!!! 😍
This is the sweetest thing I have seen in days. BigTimeAWWW.  
Keep us posted on him/her. She's a cutie keeper.
😍♥️♥️♥️♥️
It looks so precious sleeping!
Im not crying, you are 🥺
What a sweet puppy 😍
Thank you for sharing
Omgoodness 😍😭
Is this a common issue with female dogs, specifically Shepard dogs? My friend has an Australian Shepard female that is deaf. the only other deaf dog I knew was also a def female border collie / Australian Shepard mix. Could be a coincidence but maybe someone knows something I don’t!

Edit: common issue being that they are deaf
I'm die...    o<-<
To a dog this is the best alarm.
Um, thank you for shattering my heart into a million pieces!
Those eyes 😍
I just feel sorry and sad when I watch these videos. Ugh poor little guy.
you have a deer-fox! [https://hildatheseries.fandom.com/wiki/Twig](https://hildatheseries.fandom.com/wiki/Twig)

I have a blue eyed, white hair cat, and every week or two I think that I’m extremely lucky he isn’t blind or deaf.

... even if he is a fucking asshole
Aww, so adorable
She is so happy to see you :)
I had a deaf lab for almost 16 years. Touch got him so excited.
the snack thats easy to catch
aww indeed
I almost want a deaf puppy just so I can have this happen to me
Aweee that’s just perfect
My older dog went deaf (confirmed when I absent-mindedly ran over her tail with the vacuum cleaner while she was asleep), so I got to do this for a few years!

But she was a crankly lil' ol' lady shih tzu and barely gave me the time of day. I definitely didn't get these responses. Lola Granola The One-Eyed Wonder loved only one person (me), and even me she pretty much only tolerated. She was great.
My little guy is 15 now & blind. I found I was startling him on a regular basis & learned that, if I blow on him, he wakes up a lot more easily than touching him right away!!
This dog is awesome, so spunky and genuine! 

Deaf dogs are the best :) We took home my grandma’s shihtzu because she passed away from cancer a few years ago. I’m not sure if my grandma never knew or just didn’t tell us, but we soon came to find out that Canelle (the shihtzu) was deaf. We were worried about the impact it might have on her life, especially since she was 10 y/o, but she was just as lively as this dog. We had to put her down last week because of late stage cancer, but I would get another deaf dog in a heart beat!
WIGGLES ACTIVATED
She’s beautiful, OP! Thank you for sharing... just precious. 🥰
This will help me sleep tonight.
Is that a double Merle Aussie? I have a double Merle border collie that my wife and I drove up to Ohio to adopt. Totally deaf and mostly blind, but man does she have a personality. Be kind a patient with her and she’ll love you for ever. Velcro dog for sure.
What breed is this?, so adorable 😍
Is that a double meril aussie shepherd? I had one too, they grow up so sweet. We taught him different commands using stomps so he could feel them
That’s gotta be the best
Cute af :)
I have several deaf and deaf-blind cats. The joy of my life is dumping treats in front of their faces while they sleep and watching them wake up and go wild eating.
Thank you for sharing this!!  My heart & soul needed it!
I was just sleping,
didn't hear you come in,
was dreaming of next time I'd see you again.

then what do I feel?
coming in from above?

could it be?
could it be??
the hand that i love?

IT IS!
IT IS!!
Now it's time to attacc!!!

With all of my fury,
And ALL the tail wags!!

Now we can play,
until i get sleepy,
and go back to dreamland,
where your arms will greet me :)
Bless your heart for taking in that pupper.
