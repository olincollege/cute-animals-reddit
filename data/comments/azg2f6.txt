This seems like a wonderful way for cats to burn off extra energy, but I know the dorks I have won't even look at it. These two don't even play with boxes!
Where do you buy this contraption?
We all knew this, but thanks for confirming (how subreddit is powered)
I’d like to think this how the whole world is powered. There’s a large community of cats at the core of the earth, previously believed to be made of hot magma. It’s actually just extremely devoted cats who travel up to the surface, because they sustain on milk and food left on porches of good samaritans. 

Edit:Cats are lactose intolerant, so don’t feed real cats milk...  just fictional earth powering cats can have milk. 
I'm renting a Toyota Yaris and I'm fairly sure this is what powers it.
That's wheel cute.

Not to be dramatic, but I would die for this cat
Powered by cuteness
What makes this awwww is the part where we see the kitten easily get off the treadmill, by her own choice.
I want a human sized version and no, I don’t want to run on a boring flat treadmill, I want to run on a wheel 
Produces one kw/h AKA one kitty watt per hour. It’s the cleanest and purest of energy sources!
When I did a bunch of game streaming my "gimmick" was just having the cat wheel in the background so people could watch Maya walk on it.

It got to the point where the joke was she was powering the stream because she would walk so often. 

And of course I used a picture of her sleeping in the wheel for when I was offline since I had no power.
Hope she remembers to take breaks, or she'll end up cat-atonic
Can’t decide if the kitty is tiny or the wheel big...
He's like "How did I get on this? And why can't I stop!?"
It's kind of strange that I hadn't seen a single post with one of these treadmills for cats, and then within the span of a week there's been 4 top posts with them in it.
Love her 
This is how all of Reddit is powered.  This is just one of thousands of cats.  Probably 
When he stopped and got off I expected my computer to turn off.
I want the wheel and the baby!!! Give them to me!!! 😂
Keep going little kitty. We need you more than ever. 
The fact that I got an"error could not load this video" error basically sums it up
Those poor kittens!!! How many of them are enslaved just so that we can be on Reddit? *keeps scrolling*
CHEVRON LOCKED!
I wish those things weren't so darned expensive. My fat boy could really use the exercise.
My chonker would maybe do this if the red dot was right in front of him. 
oh my god that kitten is so small
This subreddit is powered by reposting karma bots, we all know that.
Please hang a (toy) mouse on a string just in front..
I want to buy one of these so badly but last time I saw online, on Amazon, it cost an insane $500!! I figured it would only be a couple hundred at the most. 
I want one of those wheels so badly but their fucking *three hundred dollars*
That is one low resistance wheel. 
My heart... 😍
Looks like a Dyson fan
reminds me of this [https://www.reddit.com/r/awwwtf/comments/axeie7/pippa\_is\_the\_best\_workout\_buddy\_until\_she\_loses/](https://www.reddit.com/r/awwwtf/comments/axeie7/pippa_is_the_best_workout_buddy_until_she_loses/)
Why is the wheel so big? Keeps it from turning too quickly?
Cutest thing 😍😍😍
For best effects tape a laser pointer somewhere where its is shining on the wheel about a third of the way up one side.
Excellent title.  Excellent gif.  Excellent kitteh.


Am I the only who who wants a people sized version
Give this cat 100% of the profit 
Ah, so this is __the__ reddit server. 

The cat sleeps, reddit goes down. 

Got it.
Anyone responding have one of these? Love to try it with my kitties. 
Cat 1: Hey, uhh, Crouton, can you take my next shift? I need to chase a laser while being recorded.
Crouton: Yeah, sure. I'll be here anyt- he's chasing the laser
Shit that is adorable.
Is that a flerken???
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work
That is such a huge, ridiculous thing to own in a home. I wanna be friends with someone who is that dedicated to their cats. 
Where can I get one?!
I'm surprised a cat would like this
Was it just me or did anyone watch this video like 100 times for like an hour 😄

HOLY SHIT YOUR KARMA. I THOUGHT I HAD ALOT BUT FUCKING HELL
Those goddamn wheels are like $400 on Amazon. Some bullshit right there. If anyone knows of sane vendor, let me know.
Kitten power!! ✊🏻
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
baby flirkin
How did this post get 114k upvotes in 10 hours? I’ve never seen a post blow up like this before.
Did you all know that if you put a mouse with a cage wheel it will run on average 8 km a day? True story.

See research by K. Stanford in Diabetes 2018
Cats are clearly superior,  seeing this got just under double then a recent post.  Lol. Cats rule
u/wolverine-claws

😍😍
My cat would just sit there 
I kinda want to build one of those, but I don't know if my cat would actually use it.  She'd probably just sit in the box that some of the parts came in. 

Would be kind of funny to add magnets along the edges and stationary magnetic coils and see how much power you can get out of it. 
i love that noise cats make \^_^
What happened to the sound of this video?? the kittens sound so cute!
wonder if they ever suddenly stop mid stride and catapult. GET IT
Awww little baby kitty! 
Wait till the oxygen thieves at PETA see this.
This is great

lol cute kitten and the biggest kitten toy ever

and it likes its toy too
AH HA! I knew goose was fueling this subreddit all along! "Only a cat" my face!
It would be so cute to take videos of kitty on this from the same angle as she's growing. Then edit to combine all the videos together so we can see kitty grow big before our eyes! 
Damn those things are huge. If I could fit one in my 1BR apartment I'd love to get one for my cats.
This is how they powered Thanos' spaceships in Infinity War. 
Beware, the cat can open a portal to different dimension
Pretty sure that's the power supply for the reddit search engine.
Powered by pure cuteness! 🐱❤️
Look at this size!!! 😍😍😍
Nah, it's powered by pitbull's smiles.
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!! 
Did you have to help/show your kitty to use it or did he/she learn themself?
That cat is going places!
The cutest depths of despair.
My cousin made a gizmo like that which dispenses cat food after a certain number of rotations.

You say you wonder, but I feel like you found the answer.
I thought it was powered by girlfriends who get pets their boyfriends didn't want.

I'm thinking for a while now about getting a wheel like that for my two (slightly) overweight cats... any experiences out there to share? Maybe even negative ones?
Smart kitten, for a while i thought that poor kitty was trap in the wheel and crying. But he figure out.
Cute!
Makes sense. There is no animal more distractable than a kitten.

 My cat is giving me massive cuddles and head butts cuz of this cute lil kittens squeaks!

Oh....my....fish!  Too cute...does she ever stop? Hope note...my favorite sub!

I don't know why but the cries of this kitten are making my normally quiet cat very vocal.

Katnetic Energy.
Oh that’s gold!
I knew it
The secret to renevable energy is just duct taping a buttered piece of bread to a cat's back butter side out and dropping it and then just keep collecting the kinetic energy from an endless roll the.

Edit:butter side facing the back*
Pure energy
Oh those kittens are kings on that household.
When the cat gets bigger growing up, is this still fine for the spine? 
New way to generate electricity, let's get kitties on exercise wheels, most likely needs millions of them but could be possible. One in every home.

So when did cat wheels become a thing? And it looks like cats love it. I need one.
Why do I get the impression that once the cats have examined this thing and know what it is they'll ignore it forever?
I thankful for this tiny bean
Look at that speed! It’s quickly approaching peak cuteness velocity.
Kitten power!!
Nice caption! And nice kitty!!
Would 100% buy this for my cat; but then have to return it because he would only play with the box 
Those wheels cost a lot of money, do there's good chinese knockoff ?
Someone please tell me where to get a kitty wheel, I have two Bengals and their wheel is broken, companies went out of business. 
how many times is this going to be reposted? you couldn't even wait a week?

So I wonder if you could include a mouse animation on the inside, would the cat see it running? Perhaps that could cause an issue similar to laser pens, so I'm scratching my head to what animation would be a nice thing for a cat to see - maybe a waddling penguin, I dunno

I got one of these hoping to train my cats to use it. Now only our small dog uses it. But she freakin LOVES it. She will zoom outside and then come in and zoom some more. 
Ha ha good one
So cute.. biggest wheel for just a tiny kitten.

Where is the mouse?!

Omgeee..I wanna build one of these now. 
I feel like my cats would run from this thing.
How does the kitten even get into that kitty litter?
Awww... Kitten powered subreddit.
You're a bunch of slavers
whenever i see these things, i wonder if the cat knows it's running in place
Thank you, subreddit master! 
Oh meow godddd
I keep seeing videos with these things, but I can't imagine actually having something like that in my house l.

Then again, if they have one big enough for my 4 year old son, I might be interested.
to increase power generation, strap a laser pointer on the kitten's head pointing forward
This is the key to global warming!
Looks EXACTLY like my baby Stewie when he was a kitten,  extra long tail and all. He's now a long,  tall,  supermodel sexy boy!

I cannot support slavery. Unsubscribed. 
With slave kitty labor??

That’s not very r/awww
More like the entire internet 
Yes
This is satisfying to watch 
OMG. Do they make these for hyperactive dogs... cause my corgi never stops moving. He gets two long walks a day and many rounds of intense fetch... but HE NEVER STOPS! He would love this shit so much
That's cute
Hmmm I want to get one of these for my wife’s cats. One is chunky and needs to do something with himself.
Makes sense.
I knew it!
It’s run by cuteness
This explains so much!
You mind me asking what make that is. We got the one fast cat type. A bit un sturdy and noisy. Thanks
Imagine the absolute power that would be achieved if that cute kitty was full-grown.
How dare you enslave kittens to power this subreddit!!!
It was a time in mmorpg when the server crashed we was jocking that the trainee stopped pedaling in the server room basement. 
My local cat lounge has one of these but all they do is take naps on it
The perspective is fucking me up. The cat looks the size of a mouse tf?
Ah yes the power of Slave kittens 
Well, that's not wrong. 
Not in picture: scoochin puppers generating some supplementary static friction
🎼The Cat On the wheel goes Tippy Tap! Tippy Tap, tippy Tap!
*insert break my stride*
I hope this cat is paid well for his troubles.
Do cats willingly use this? How long will they go? My cat is lazy, even when I try to play with her. She needs the exercise, especially as an indoor cat.
What makes animals enjoy running on a wheel? Doesn't it confuse them that they aren't moving?
My bad, I thought it was powered by unicorn farts or something.
My cat would love to sit on this and never move.

Can I have a human version of this wheel?  That looks like fun 
Honestly, this is adorable but I LOVE that flooring

this brought a geniune smile on my face, thank you.

Plot twist : its a hamster
I am afraid to buy one of these and have the 3 dorks stare at it and never use it. 
Can these generate energy? It's probably negligible but it would be cool to say my cat charges my phone.
i could watch this forever 
Look how happy that tail is!!

Why do kitty on kitty wheel videos get up voted beyond 100k?
With slave labor! 
This is what powers Reddit’s search engine 
That’s spectrum internet.... cute little mittens... 
how do I train a cat to do this 
This would freak out my cat!  Sometimes she even jumps when she sees her own tail move when it's in an awkward position.  She's not too bright, but definitely a love bug and I wouldn't trade her for the world.  In all fairness though, she is 15 so I do need to cut her some slack.
Step1. Put every foster animal in a shelter with this
Step2. Attach a small motor to device
Step3. Sell made energy to utility companies
Step4. PROFIT
I wonder if my pug would use this contraption. She’s hyperactive 
This is the first time I've literally said "aww"!!!

The title is even funnier when you realise it’s (I think) a repost from just a few days ago.
Awww poor thing
Okay... this may be an unpopular opinion but why are we not hooking these up to generators at animal shelters and using them to generate a small amount of power. Like I get that we aren't talking a city block or even the shelter. But it seems like you could cut some cost doing that after the investment. Plus the dogs and cats could excercise. I could see that turning into something exploited like an episode of black mirror.
