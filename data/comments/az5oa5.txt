RESCUE RANGGGGEEEERRRSS!! CH-CH-CH-CHIP AND DALE! 
What kind of majestic breed is Chip?
The dog on the left’s name is Birch. His Instagram is @beingbirch
1. These two are amazing, and 
B. How often do you see a Dalmatian have the less interesting coat?
What kinda of breed is that majestic beast on the left?
Oh my god these are the most beautiful dogs I've seen also great camera quality
chip looks like he's seen all the shit in the world and has had enough of it 
1# this is stolen

2# not even the dogs names

3# your account is only 14 days old and you’ve already resorted to this?
OP was this taken in Newfoundland?
You could replace Josh Brolin in any movie with Chip and I don't think anyone would notice. He has the face.
Dale is gonna grow up to be a big ole pup. Look at those amazing paws
Chip looks wise AF
Those are the weirdest looking chipmunks I've ever seen!
If Wes Anderson is making a sequel to isle of dogs..
This looks like a movie poster of a buddy cop film. One dog is all seasoned and tired of the bullshit. The other is new to the force and eager to catch bad guys.
Actually their names are Birch and Campbell and this image is taken directly from Instagram.
The dalmatians name is Cam and he's a much bigger Dogger now lmao. This photo is a few years old and a repost, I'm actually friends with his owner. 
Are you in West Elizabeth in RDR2?
Sign me up for a series where they solve mysteries.
The one on the left has to be my spirit animal. What a gorgeous dog.
I like how we all already know who is who. xD
I'd  go to the theatres for this movie.
I won't be satisfied until one of them has a leather pilot jacket and the other a Hawaiian shirt
The paws on the Dalmatian are as big as the big pup, he’s going to be HUGE!
Boomer from Far Cry 5
 The background looks like it belongs in a Stephen King book.
Majestic
Chip knows things about you and doesn't need to tell you what they are. Dale is Dale. 
Looks like a Disney movie cast. 
These dogs make me want to eat chocolate chip cookie cream ice cream.
Those are the two rock’nest dawgs I believe I’ve ever seen. 
I want to go on a adventure with them.
Aww.
This should be a Disney movie
I kind of forgot Dalmatians were a thing. Great looking pooches!  
CHEESE AND RICE THEY ARE SO CUTE
Dog on the left needs to be a cartoon.

So unique looking.
Holy hell!!

What is that bigger brown one mixed with? That is an awesome dog!!
So. Freaking. Cute! 
Aww soo cutieful 😍
These are the best looking dogs I’ve ever seen
Homeward Bound
Cha-cha-cha Chip and Dale's .. Rescue Rangers!
They look like a grizzly old cop and his innocent new partner.

But was the city built on rock and roll? 
The bigger dog looks like Kurt Russell. 
Wise beyond his years and extremely naive 
They look like they're ready to play good cop bad cop... Both are too cute for words! 
You have a couple of *very* handsome puppies 🖤
There should be a movie about these two. 
What breed is the grey dog? He is sooo cute!
I need both of them
What breed is the dog on the left
What type of dog is the one on the left?
not only did you steal this from a popular instagram account with no credit, you renamed the dogs?? how bad do you need internet validation 
Cute Dalmatian! But who’s hyena?
#where's the other good boi?


I only see one here?!?!
When I see two different breeds of dog like this, I often wonder, does each dog think it looks like the other one.


You're a dog. I'm a dog. Therefore I must look like you.


LMAO! YEAH BUDDY! 
Hope you’re ready for the Dalmatian my friend. They require a ton of training and socializing, it cannot just be socialized with your dog and the neighbors you need large dog parks and all dog breeds to be around him. 

A common issue once they get older is aggressive behavior towards any male dog that isn’t neutered. 

They have very similar temperaments to the Doberman Pinscher but are even harder to train. 

I’m sure you know all this, but a lot of people get them cause their beautiful dogs and it turns into a absolute nightmare. 
This is the best thing I’ve seen all day. 

Straight out of a 30's book!
Very handsome boys.

When is their album dropping?
This is so adorable! 
Speckles and Spots...
Chip is Such a badass dog!!
HAHA YASS ROCK ME BOIS
Kid and Play

Wow what beautiful dogs
They built this city on ruffs and bones

There's something off putting about that Dalmatian 
Beautiful!  Both of them are absolutely beautiful!
If the Dalmation's name isnt Chip Im fighting everyone in the comment section..
Oh my goodness, to much cuteness overload in one photo . 
That Dalmatian has big paws, he’s gonna be a big boy.
I see the shadow of someone holding something to get their attention. What item made them so attentive?
awwwwwww
They look like the before and after of a an Oreo milkshake 
Beautiful 
These guys keep the dark arts at bay, Gang Gang! 
Omfg
Holy shit you see the mits on dat pupper.
Looks a bit like southeast Alaska 
What city is it? I want to say Edinburgh and that is the park down the other end of the grange. How wrong am I?
They look like they give the best hugs 
The motherland. I miss her. Time for a visit!!
I love how they seem like they're sitting to get their photo taken ♥️
One on the left looks like Joe Dirt
Wow

They are amazing 
Aww
It would take me at least three hours to get my two dogs to pose  half as well as these guys.

WE BORK THIS CITY! WE BORK THIS CITY! WITH CHIP AND DALE🎶

WE BORK THIS CITY! WE BORK THIS CITY! WITH CHIP AND DAAAAAAAAAALE🎶

Man, the non Dalmatian one looks like he’s got some hyaena blood!
When does this movie come out? I’m so down for going to see it!
What dog is that on the left?
They are both adorable!
What city ?? I love these boys,and i don’t even know them.
They look like they were at two different distances from a copier when the ink exploded. 
Edit: a word.
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. 
Love both, but that dog on the left is beautiful
Unreal pups
Chip looks like he'd be very camouflaged 
They are absolutely beautiful 😍😍😍
Camodog
One on left eyeing that treat like nobody’s business. It’s like he’s going to interrogate it before he eats it.
I can't look at a dalmatian without crying, grew up with one year for year, born 3 days after I was. 

SO cute
What kind is that?! Its so cute!
WOW!  Those are BEAUTIFUL doggos!

Grizzled Veteran and the rookie.

I'm jealous of Chip, that coat is something else.
These 2 hit the town and just slay ass
**I WANNA ROCK!**
I expected Chipmunks.

I'm not disappointed at all though.
Chip looks like he is fed up of Dales shit 
Next ones should be Gadget, Monterey Jack, and Zipper
The city isnt ready for them
Dog on the left looks like he’s seen some shit....
'He's going throw! Gonna throw any sec Chip!'
'Steady Dale... study the ball. Be one with the ball'
The doggy on the left is definitely of the cookies and cream ice cream breed.
14/10 would buy their mixtape 
Aww! So cute 
Oh man this brings back memories. When I was a little kid (over 25 years ago) we had an English Springer Spaniel named Chip and my dad got another ESS puppy and I insisted we named him Dale. That was the dog I grew up with. Thanks for hitting my heart strings, Reddit. 
The Baskets pups
Look at the pAws on Dale 
^///^
What kind of dog is the bigger one? I've never seen a dog quite like it. Their absolutely charismatic together.
Just awesome
Jesus that's a really interesting looking dog. I'd love to see it in person. 
They are so cute 😍
I feel like if the long-haired dog could talk, he’d have great stories with life lessons mixed in.
BRB, catching a flight to wherever these boys are. Gonna have some adventures
So adorable
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Love chips huge era and dales huge paws.
Hehe, Chip and Dale dancers 
A pair of extremely photogenic doggo's.

Kind of wish their names were Sawyer and Freckles
They’re strippers??
Wow that dog is beautiful.. the other one is super cute to hah
Whoa thats a new level of beautiful what kind of dog is the big boi?
If this was a cartoon that big dog would be a gruff no nonsense dog while the small one would be a fast talking British dog.

What breed is Chip? He looks awesome. Or Is is that Dale? The big one :)
So cute
I would watch a series about these two going on adventures and solving crimes. 
Hail peta. Burn the animals

They want to eat your face.
I hope Dale is the big one
😍😍😍
Why do I love these dogs so much just from a photo?
Both of em look like they don't fuck around. 

5/7 would let them be part of my crew anyday. 
What breed is the grey one? Never seen a dog like it!
Holy camouflage, BatMan!

I get a hunch that these two know mischief on a first name basis.
The guy on the left is the coolest looking dog!
That pup has some paws... 🐾 
oh my god. The dream team. of my doggie dreams. 
Man, Isle of Dogs cosplays are now a thing. 
Little man has more arms than he knows how to use.

Beautiful Duo 😍🐶🐶
Stunning dogs
All I see are 2 varieties of cookie dough
Did you name your dogs after Chippendale's, be honest 
What camera are you using, op?
What a great city! Is that Seattle?
[deleted]
What type of doggo is the one on the left
What kinda dog is the big one?

WWWWOWZA! Such cool doggos!
They look like they're the stars of a homeward bound style talking animal movie.

 The long haired one is a serious no nonsense kind of dog. He's older and really resented the puppy's arrival to the family. The puppy is an optimistic goofball who always sees the best in every situation and in every creature they meet along the way. 

As they travel the countryside looking for their person the long haired dog warms to the puppy and they become the best of friends. They carefully avoid the evil dog catchers throughout their journey. Then disaster strikes just as they turn into their person's street. The dog catcher grabs the puppy and drives him to the pound. Now long haired dog has to face coming home alone, and seeing the hurt on his person's face that puppy didn't make it. But it's okay! Puppy is microchipped and the dog catcher is actually an awesome animal loving fellow and the family is happily reunited and the movie going children learn a wonderful lesson about the importance of microchipping your pets.

I'd watch the heck out of that movie. Especially if there was a scene where the two had a big argument and went their separate ways but then long haired dog found himself in a dangerous situation and puppy saved the day with his good nature or through an act of goofiness that served as a distraction.
