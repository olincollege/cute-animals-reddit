*You passed out drunk in bed*

*Your dog*: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to go ahead and graaaab your phone before you drunk text your ex again‚Äù
I see this posted on other pages all claiming to own the dog

Why would you have a camera filming in your bedroom?
Oh my god I love this dog ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wish my husband was trained that well
I've always loved the way goldens "smile". This amazing dog seems to smile after each little task he's doing.
Melts my heart
A++ best doggo of the day
This made me tear up a little.
These home automation systems are really getting complicated.. TOBY!.. Goodnight? Good boy.

This is too precious and made my heart melt
At first I thought this was seriously the sweetest fuckin thing ever that ever happened spontaneously and by itself. 

Eventually I realized it was just the sweetest fuckin thing
Dog: "get off that damn phone and go to bed!"
I LOVE HIM
Lucky owner to have such a caring dog
So they trained him to do that so people on the internet would think this is a dog with the awareness of an adult human being. Wonder why it‚Äôs muted?
If the dog was really that good it would‚Äôve put the phone on the charger
Well that's the goodest boy I've ever seen
That is the goodest boy i have seen in a while

I for sure thought he was going to plug your phone in and I was about to freak out.
I know he was taught this but I choose not to think that and imagine this is just his instinct and it's veeeeery adorable
Hey I just wanted to leave this comment to let you know that I would die for your dog any day

I'd be a little concerned if pup then plugged in your phone and then turned off the camera.
Put some bottom sheets on your bed.
He lick

Omgosh. Greatest thing ever.
Why do Goldens look so sad so often? I've known a bunch, and they are generally some of the happiest most friendly dogs, but they get this look when they're doing brain work, as if they're doing a *really* had math problem, like all the effort is almost painful.   
It's probably just a ploy to get more treats, because I definitely just want to give them a treat and a belly rub to get that happy golden smile back.
Mind blown.
I hope one day when I adopt my own dog, I will be a good dog mom that my dog will want to do this to me...

But most probably, he's already going to be in bed with me.
