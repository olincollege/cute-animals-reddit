Barkinson's
This was me as a kid when I had to come inside a freezing cold house to poop after swimming in the pool
It would be the tail going but he's sitting on it and all the vibrations are going through the rest of him.
As a dog groomer of 12 years, I have seen so many dogs vibrate like this just from sheer excitement and being overwhelmed with sensory ecstasy. They can barely contain themselves!!!
If my dog got that excited, that backseat would be *drenched* in urine.
Awww, what would happen if you opened the door at that exact moment?

r/whatswrongwithyourdog
That‚Äôs the biggest chihuahua I‚Äôve  ever seen
Sometimes I do something similar.   It's because I'm a mix of nervous and excited (more excited but still nervous). 

Good doggo
He's like a giant, nice chihuahua. I don't know how he sees things when he's shaking that hard.
Your dog ate a marital aid
He's stuck on vibrate. You need to change the settings to "bark"

Better check the seat for pee

Hey wouldn't it be great if you could set dogs to vibrate instead of barking?
This made me lol, very loud. My dog does a version of this but just his legs lol

Wow, don‚Äôt even have to put a quarter in him
Are humans even capable of being this excited? I wonder if it feels the same. I think even getting super excited as babies pales in comparison what it must feel like to be excited as a dog. Their world mus be a massive rollercoaster of emotions every minute. I imagine the opposite of this level of excitement  would be the super anxious/sad bark/whine of when their owner leaves to go into a store or something. Must be exhausting being a dog, or maybe they just forget things instantly?
E N E R G Y
Dog goes *brrr*
If there wasn't a title id think he was terrified lol.

My dog does that when she's scared of thunderstorms
When you see your server coming with your food
He's realizing they ain't at the park, they at the VET
you gotta make sure he doesn't vibrate too fast or else he'll phase through the floor
When my dog moves like that it's because she's terrified of something.

I love all the people so concerned. I take my dog on walks in the park every day. For 2 years now she does this every day we‚Äôre in the car going to the park. Dogs are ridiculous and awesome.
Are you sure that's not a seizure?
I‚Äôd put that bad boy up to my neck and enjoy the massage.
I didn't realize I was on an endless loop. Was waiting to see what he was getting excited about.
It might not be anything, but do go get that dog checked out by a vet. My dog started doing this wild shaking of excitement at mealtimes... in tandem with difficulty navigating the house, irrational issues with doorways and floor transitions, proclivity toward jumpiness, and spinning in circles in confusion of where to go. 

She turned out to have a neurological issue caused/compounded by issues with her adrenal system and I think her liver (kidneys maybe?), compounded by the steroids and other drugs for her allergy issues. We and the first vet thought she had brain cancer, especially since her hair was just falling out everywhere, and it took a canine neurologist to get the right answer and get her on the mend.

I‚Äôm not saying this video isn‚Äôt adorable (cuz holy heck it‚Äôs cute), but bringing up that a dog shaking in excitement that doesn‚Äôt normally shake may be worth talking to your vet about, as it could be an early sign of significant health issues. It could also be nothing, but no risk taking with puppers; we must protecc.
Doggo go brrr.
Looks like a focal seizure to me. You should talk to your vet.
Ok so. This is actually very concerning. My dog used to do the exact same thing and at only 2 died of a condition called generalized tremor syndrome. He couldn't eat properly and it started happening when he got excited. This is NOT ok and they should see a vet immediately.
He is collecting energy to evolve into a super woofin.
Bless him. Dogs are here to teach us how to experience joy and excitement. Your pup is doing a very good job.
My dog used to do this. People would always ask me if he was cold
OMG my puppy does this when he knows we're about to go on a walk. We've never known a dog who does it so the first few times it happened we thought something was REALLY wrong with him. I'm happy to know he's not the only one :)
Shake n bark
Hey your dog is ringing
This is me!! In the car as a kid the excitement is real...
Dog Park or squirrel?
What breed is your dog? Looks veryyyy similar to mine but we have no idea!
Does he see the dog park?
My lab does this when we play ball
My dog is a mutt, and I've been trying to narrow down what breed(s) he may be. 

He looks somewhat similar to your dog, so just curious as to what breed this is?
This is what happens when your dog swallows a vibrator.

One of my dogs was just like this. He'd get excited and would come down with the full-body tremblies.
He vibin
My dog does the same!! Although for her it‚Äôs when she thinks she gets to play fetch. Waits at the garage door and just shakes. We call it the shakey-baby act.
Bro he literally jus vibin
My 14 yr old doggo shakes also but not as extreme, his excitement comes from anticipating what table food he's gonna get.  He's not fat by any means but he loves any food I'm willing to share.
This is incredible. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Omg baby
Uuhhhh that‚Äôs a seizure. /s

My dog does this too! If we tell him he can go in the back yard he gets so excited he shakes with anticipation. It‚Äôs like his muscles are super charging before he can go sprint around.
My pug does this before almost every meal.
your dog is broken i reccomend returning for a full refund
You left your dog alarm on vibrate.

I love how dogs can't hide their emotions.
We humans learn its not socially acceptable so try so hard to hide the physical side of our emotions.
My dog does this a bit.  I thought he had palsy or some shit.
Dont know if this is relevant. My parents dog started to shake when excited. And it turned out it was an early display of "Addisons Disease" a problem with the adrenaline gland and adrenaline production.

Keep an eye on it. Im sure hes fine and is just insanely excited.

But you know. Theres some mild info if they get poorly and the vet doesnt know why, its hard to diagnose.

I like that's he's trying his best to contain it all and he's doing pretty well. Very composed Good Boy.
Are you sure he doesn't have a tremor disorder that is triggered by strong emotions?
Per OP this is not a seizure, but as a heads up for other dog owners - this is what seizures present like for dogs. They aren't all that uncommon, they're not all grand mal level. But beware if you see this that it may be a focal seizure
Looks like somebody knows they're at the park!

My first thought was... you really need to turn down that shock collar.

I seen this bit before. Tell Childs to get the flamethrower.
That dog is getting a call.  Ringer off.
I had a dog that did this too. Aussie Shep x Brittany Spaniel male, only did this when we were getting ready to go for a drive or take him for a walk. He knew not to bark, but made a ragged, high-pitched whine. Mom nicknamed him "grillo", which is Spanish for "cricket".
As I say ‚Äúdo you want to GO!‚Äù Shaking gets harder as I walk toward the door.
Lol I think I met you at the vet once, I recognize that dog. He did that same thing when he saw my dogs and wanted to play.
Is his collar to tight?
LOOK OUT IT‚ÄôS GONNA BLOW
Hes just doing the terry Cruz peck dance but with all his muscles.
I'd be worried he matches the natural frequency of the car seat and starts phasing through.
My dog was the same but it was usually followed by uncontrollable peeing...

My service dog used to do something similar. It was a nervous system issue rooted in his spine and neck. Ultimately lead to him being put to sleep. Something I'm still in a dark place about and it is not easy to talk about. 

I'm not saying that's what this is. But it's extremely similar looking. I'd get it checked out.
What does your Vet say about this behavior?
My little dog used to do this when riding in the car because he got so scared.  You sure he isn't scared?
OP, not sure if that gray collar is one of those Flea & Tick ones, but if it is, and if I remember correctly, recently there was a recall on those because of potential health issues with dogs dying prematurely when using those collars. So if it is, I‚Äôd do some research on it.

This reminded me of when my golden went into seizures =(

Glad this is a happy seizure
He's just on *silent mode* just vibrations, turn on the volume so that he can bark
I know they say that dog do this whenever they need to release emotional energy. I always hate seen them doing it over nervous energy, but it‚Äôs really sweet when it is due to being happily excited.
Is he happy or scared ?

Are you sure he's not having seizures?
Can you make sure this isn‚Äôt a seizure just in case? Maybe text it to your vet. Maybe you already have but, just make sure he‚Äôs okay.

That looks more like anxiety than excitement.

My dog shakes like that too but I think it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs nervous

You need a check up for diabetes and and adrenal hormone functions. This is not normal and definitely not smth cute.
Is he ok ? My old jack Russell did that all the time until one day she had a grand mal seizure after then she always had them every time she would shake like that cbd treats helped alot for my case
I think I would take my dog to a vet if I saw him doing this. I'd be afraid he was suffering some sort of seizure. Not that I'm saying that's what it is. Just saying what I would think if I saw it.
_"My goals are beyond your understanding"_
Is he ok?
Harlem shake
People react so quickly and extremely to a few seconds of a video. To me, this screams that this healthy happy dog is full of so much excitement and anticipation, but people think it‚Äôs a seizure/tumor/life threatening problem. 

The best and worst thing about Reddit are the people who use it. 

You have what looks to be a very sweet pup who would ignore your calls to come back just so he can keep greeting everybody he sees. I‚Äôd love a chance to pet it! More videos please!

This happens to be when I get really nervous, last time it happened when I asked my crush to be my gf. (She said yes)
Excited? Bruh, it looks like he‚Äôs having an anxiety attack.
This actually could be a neurological issue that gets set off. Look up shaking white dog syndrome. It‚Äôs most common in white dogs but happens in other breeds. Different noises or excitement would set off my Westie. I know many people with small dogs who just thought they were scared or over excited.
parkinson's
Truthfully that looks like an epileptic seizure.  I should know I have a dog that is epileptic.  Not Fun.
I don't wanna sound rude but can you double check with the vet, do scan, do tests. It is a strong reaction and it is better to make sure that he is healthy
You sure he‚Äôs not having a seizure? ü§î
That's aka extreme anxiety.
[removed]
Gotta check out whether he's got a nerve disease or not.
Are we 100% sure its not a seizure? Like 100%?
Looks like blood vessel constriction or lack of oxygen to the brain due to that collar being so tight. Looks buried 1-2 inches deep in the dog's neck.
That collar is too tight.
This dog needs cdb. Don't normalize this.
Are you people blind? This dog is scared out of his mind of being in the car ..
Are you sure this isn‚Äôt unhealthy or a condition, you should get him checked.

Finally, my spirit animal has revealed himself.
When my social anxiety kicks in...
I thought he was getting blasted by wind through to the Window
I love him üôèüíñ
He reminds me of the guy popping veins holding back.
He looks like Scooby-Doo!
Better turn him off vibrate and turn the bark on.
Damn... how many rails did you give him?
He's like a rocket ship preparing for takeoff
Me when I leave the pool for absolutely no reason:
Thought he was about to phase through the seat
When yr  dog sits on yr vibratior
Omg so sweet but my heart hurts for him too.

This level of enthusiasm is missing in most of our lives.
