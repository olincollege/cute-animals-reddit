YOU GOT ME A DOG!!!
"I just met you and I love you. "
What a good dog, the body language is all so welcoming and friendly to the little new guy. Never roughs him up or overwhelms him.
This is amazing. Perfect post to go to bed to. Thank you 
"OMG, was I pregnant?" 
r/dogs_getting_dogs
I would love to see an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture of them snuggled up on the couch. 
He keeps looking back like ‚Äúare you heckin seein this Dad!‚Äù So cute! 
I‚Äôm going to steal your dogs ‚ù§Ô∏è
Pup is like "I see why you got a new dog, the old one's obviously broken"

What a sweet doggo.  I wish I could get that happy about anything.
This was an hour too short
Oh boy oh boy oh boy!
perfect introduction :‚Äô) that went well!!
My dog is 9 years old. He will probably live to 15. Is a great dog and will out smart most dogs and people. I desperately want abother pup just to have him pass on a fraction of his traits. Everytime I see something like this I remember my desperation. Nothing will ever replace my dog jerry but I really wish he will influence the next generation.
My old doberman when she was about 8, saw our new German Shepherd puppy when we first brought her home and immediately puked. Probably the funniest reaction I have seen in a dog, she was always kind of a grouch and not the best with other dogs (great with people though after we had her for a few years as she was a rescue).

I'm starting to think that posts with goldens are just cheating
i love how the older dog immediately takes a submissive position to show the pup it doesn't need to be afraid of it
So freaking sweet....the pets in my house would give me a look like...ummm hellllll no! Then walk away. That older dog is a sweetheart.
[deleted]
Is that happy turn a golden retriever thing? We think my pup is part golden and she always does the ‚Äòcircle dance‚Äô when she gets excited. I haven‚Äôt seen another dog do it, so just wondering! 
Our beagle was not as accepting of the puppy beagle we brought home. He was so upset then turned towards acting out immediately by taking a gallon sized piss on our Christmas tree while looking dead in our eyes. First and last time he ever peed in the house
I wish this never ended
Does no one have this with the audio?
That display of happiness is why dogs are better then humans. I've never been that happy before. Imagine getting so happy you start spinning in circles then sit to gain your composure. You can't hold it anymore so you just spazz out rolling around. 

Edit. Case in point. When I brought my  newborn  home from the hospital my then 2 year old was hardly impressed. He looked him over, smelled his head (idk why) then proceeded to give his new brother a speech about what toys he will share and what exactly was off limits, to the best of good ability. We all got the point. 
"omg omg mom is this real?! Dad.... Dad IS. THIS. REAL?!?! IT'S REAAAAAALL"
The puppy wagging its tail too :‚Äô)
This is so wholesome I‚Äôm crying üò≠ 
Fuckin' love dogs.
I've not felt so much joy inside in ages.  Needed this. 
God life with dogs is so goddamn sweet
adorable heart warming and life affirming
I'd be interested to hear/read the dog psychology of what's happening with the bigger one. I'm sure I'm reading it wrong, but going onto the back like that.... Isn't that a submissive pose?
Why did this video have to end... 
I will love him and pet him and call him George
Even dogs get excited about puppies 
We truly don't deserve the love dogs give us.
Put him down put him down put him down \*finally puts him down*...gif ends
Words cannot express the cuteness of this video.
There Are a few brief moments where the big dog does that wide-eyed 'holy fuck' dog face that's amazing 
I'll admit, I'm a 38 year old guy going on 39 and this made my old cold heart melt. Animals are amazing. This clip just goes to prove that. I smiled, and it brought tears of joy to my eyes. Pure, unadulterated joy. Awesome.
now that is a *really* good boy.
*Lady, put my new friend down!*
My heart is now filled with immense joy. 
This why dogs are amazing, he's beside himself with excitement but he's doing everything he can to stay calm enough to not frighten his new baby bro. Wonderful.
‚ÄúDid we just become best friends?‚Äù
every body needs friends even if it is animal.
* tiny dog appears
* guard dog: "I surrender! Kill the hoomens, not me!"
This makes me happy. I‚Äôm not even part of that family.
If dogs could speak, the older one would be screaming "IM SO HAPPY!" in Ron Burgundy's voice.
This made me cry from joy 
I know this is basically all babies, but I love how confused and clueless puppies look. 
You mean to tell me that they make other's like me !!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm all in...  Let me at em, they shall be loved.
I love dogsüòä
I love it when the dog turned around and looked at the guy like "dude are you seeing this?!"
‚ÄúOMG YOU GOT ME A PUPPY!

I LOVE PUPPIES!‚Äù

This dog  can now human.
I cant believe how happy he is. Good lord. Now I might have to get two dogs.
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying!
Did anyone else notice the electric shock that happened between big doggo paw and baby doggo collar at 0:50?
SO MUCH GOD DAMN FLOOF!!! I WANT TO CUDDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY TAIL

oh helo fren
The window cornice is a cherry stain and the cover over the sliding door is like a Mahogany. I don't always get OCD but when I do..
The best aww moment 
Cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all life.
What a precious new adventure!  
Omg why can‚Äôt humans be more like dogs, the world would be a better place.
"I shall call him mini me...woof woof"
I will love him and pet him and hug him and squeeze him and call him George.
This is actually a really good example of self handicapping in play. The older dog could read that the puppy was nervous, so rolled on his back to even the odds of any game. 
Love how he's looking at both the husband and the wife there and he's like: "AM I GETTING A SIDEKICK FOR REAL?"
I really love how big doggo gets all crazy when small doggo touches him with the paw
I wish my dog didn't loathe puppies. 
That is exactly how I felt when I walked into the room to meet my newborn GreatGrandDaughter.  

I did manage not to roll on the floor, but my joy was at that level.....

Is that human woman wearing a VR headset around her forehead?
Hey Skip, we'd like you to meet your replacement.
Pretty much my same reaction when I see a puppy
I'm going to save this so whenever I'm sad I can watch it. Thank you 
That‚Äôs awesome 
So cute!!
I hope to one day be as excited about something as that doge was to get a smaller version of itself
The dog is acting like a puppy and the puppy is as chill as an adult 
I'm not a sentimental person, but this honestly chokes me up a bit. 
gosh i love this <3
I really wish this had sound! I bet that pupper was making some noise 
Best thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
Love how he keeps looking back like: ‚ÄúBut what did you want to tell me? Forget it I‚Äôll deal with you later.‚Äù
Oh my goodness, this is so freakin' adorable. Talk about cuteness overload!
"Is it for me?  IS IT FOR ME?  I LOVE IT SO MUCH!"
Dog: OMG A BABY ITS ADORABLE OMG LOOK AT ITS LITTLE FACE AWW OH MY GOD

Puppy: üò≥
Fuck you internet bitches and trolls. You just made me cry. 
This similar thing happened to our German shepherd lab mix. We brought home two puppies and her whole demeanor changed. She instantly became happy momma dog to the new little pups.
A golden greeting. We are going to have so much fun! Fun. Fun. Fun.
Enthusiasm is over 9000!
i expect a follow up and weekly update with pictures on this beautiful relationship i‚Äôm watching blossom
>93&#37; upvoted

WHO *DARES* TO DOWNVOTE THIS? WE MUST FIND THE **DEVIANTS**!
At this point I have to blame my depression on not being a dog owner. But I cannot risk handing out the symptoms of my depression a dog.
HELLO FRENDO!!!
Please just put him down so they can play.
As a cat person, this is one of the few things that makes me jealous of dog owners. I brought a new kitten home and it‚Äôs a week long introductory period with the other two cats and they still don‚Äôt get along that well 
Guy who was breeding Golden Retrievers: Welp, they need to be water dogs, good swimmers, easy to train, eager to please, strong, and we don't want them shredding the ducks so soft mouth.

Also, like super, super nice, friendly and loving. Like over the top on that one.
Omg, Idk why but this made me teary eyed, he‚Äôs just so happy w his little puppy. It‚Äôs just too much, man. 
So that new dog is considered a petpet?
r/DGDAG
Meanwhile we had to go through like 5 cats before we found one our first cat wouldn't immediately try to kill...
Man, I really needed this. I tend to get lost in my thoughts and become super existential, to where I start questioning why there‚Äôs a purpose to anything. Dogs. Dogs are the reason we wake up in the morning. People who don‚Äôt like dogs are living a meaningless life. 
Big goofball accepts new apprentice.
Goldens are the best dogs on the planet and I say that as someone who has never owned one myself - and I am obsessed & in love with my own non-Golden dogs. But I still know goldens > dogs. My parents started getting Goldens years after I moved out. (Clearly they hate me.) 

Thank you for sharing this heartwarming video! 
Why can't cats be like this? üòÇüòÇ
This is too cute. I can't handle it. 
I just realized dogs get just as excited as people do when they see a puppy. I'm not saying the baby voices aren't wierd but they are a little less wierd.
That first spin!
wow I actually started tearing up :‚Äô)
Yea but do you think hes excited?
WE DON'T DESERVE DOGS
Made my night 
When you're so excited that you have an adorable excited stroke on the floor
I love how this new puppy is a total stranger to this dog, but is immediately treated like their own
Mini Me 
The circle of lifeeeeee
I wanna be as happy once as that dog is in the vid
Nice living room. Looks like a great spot to turn the lights off at night, look at the fire, and think about things whilst giving your best bud pats
awwwww...

but why bring him in a paper bag? It's not like it was hiding the dog or anything 
Omg I have never seen anyone so happy, feelsgood . Thank you for this!
If there was a gif in the dictionary definition of ‚ÄúWarm Welcome‚Äù this would be it
I need sound!! I cannot find this video with sound. Help!
u/deathscope my hopes with mumu
That went well. :)
Two last doggos we got, our older dog was more like "why the fuck would you bring two excited little things in my life?" She's never been aggressive towards them, but you can see she would happily be the only dog around here if she could.
Reminds me of when my family tried to add a new dog when we already had a . middle aged Golden. It didn't go well.
Wow, that‚Äôs about as good of a reaction as you could wish for!
Same
Thanks to Reddit, I know understand dog language. For example, many tail wags = happy
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs...
Why did this make me cry
Every single golden puppy I've seen is so chill. 
Even if you were a puppy once you still can't handle the cuteness of a puppy 
Dogs are the best people.
Somebody put text to this
I‚Äôm a cat person but this kind of shit makes me understand why people love dogs. My cat would fuckin lose it if I brought home a kitten. In a bad way. 
‚ÄúDid we just become best friends?‚Äù
That dog is called Neymar
I just love this. Now THAT is a sweet animal right there. I went from irritated to AWWWWWW in one split second!
Humans don‚Äôt deserve dogs
Wow. Amazing dog. So well behaved. 
Love this soooo much!
When my wife and I got our second dog, our first one was 5 years old at the time. We brought the new puppy in, set her on the floor, and my older dog looked up at both of us with this "fuck you" look and walked into the other room and laid down.
The waggy tails. SO *WAGGY*
The way he looks at his parents like "Serious? Is this my new friend?! I acnt believe this, guys!" Awww
My heart it‚Äôs melting.
This subreddit makes so much sense now!!!
It kept looking at the dude like "Daddy, is this true?! Can I keep it?!"
Meet your replacement.
Doggo went full Neymar. 
this is the cutest shit i've ever seen
‚ÄúOH OH MOM! YOU BOUGHT ME A PUPPY??‚Äù
We need updates!!
Is it just me, or did I already see this on the front page less than a week ago? 
How adorable it is and what an intelligent dog perfectly listening to the owners commands.
I act like that when I‚Äôm about to get laid 
r/dogsgettingdogs
You can get puppies from Hollister now? That shops really broadening its sales. 
The puppy is like ‚ÄúHELLO THERE!‚Äù
Brothers don't shake hands... Brothers gotta HUG!!!!!!
We just got a new puppy, a lab mix. 

My 6 year old pit had been indifferent/amused/affectionate towards it. She chews the shit out of him but besides snarling and soft biting her back, they get along well. 

However, I get GLARES from my pit every time I play with the puppy. 

We aren‚Äôt on talking terms right now. 
Having 1 dog and having a 39 hour week job can cause minor problems and a really lonely dog.

Is nobody gonna acknowledge the massive static discharge around 50 seconds in? The older dog used thundershock 
OP, PLEASE keep us updated on their friendship. This is too adorable. 
Goddammit is someone chopping onions again?
Way easier then introducing new cats, which typically hate each other at first.

Very nice repost

He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúHoly shit are you serious?! Its so cute!‚Äù
You're lucky... when we got my current dog our other (now passed) dog was *not* happy. 

She walked out of any room the pup ran into for a good two days in protest.


Took her about two weeks to accept her as part of our family. 


The cat we saved a decade earlier? 

"Don't eat, this is ours" was all it took for her to accept that we now have a leach, and that leach is off the menu. 
Little doggo was like 

‚Äú pls don‚Äôt let near this crazy man, sir ‚Äú
Dogs are the best things humans ever created. Smart, loving, loyal, obedient(that's relative), trusting, caring, fluffy... I mean... Dogs, right!

This is like when you get your kid a bike for Christmas and they're like "Omg is this mine...dad...mom...for me? Mine? Can I haz?"
I never wanted this to end.

This is how I wanted to start my week, watching something happy 
Do dogs think that puppy‚Äôs are cute the way we think baby‚Äôs are cute? 
I feel like I just got wooooshed
So this is pretty much the cutest thing ever.
Pls tell me the bread name.....
My point is made. The defense rests. 
My dog screamed @ my new puppy for a week straight when I brought him home
When we brought our younger dog home at 12 weeks, he took one look at our older dog (who is a very big boy) and promptly peed everywhere. We were very glad that meeting happened in the back yard. I was nervous for the carpet in this clip. 
Oh the feels üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
What a sweet and gentle mutt. Give it the biggest kiss for me.

My dog might try eating that lil pupper.
Wasnt this just on here yesterday? ^or ^am ^I ^crazy

both their tails!! awwwww!!
This is my favourite Reddit post of all time. 
OMG, those people got that dog a puppy.  That is just beyond adorable.
Aww puppy meets pupperino!
This is the best thing in awhile.
How about not neutering your dog and letting them have children of their own
I remember when i got a new puppy the current dog i had at that time was so comfused because my puppy was so hyper and kept breaking doggy social boundaries i guess, it was a happier time back then
Silly question, but could and would the dog house train the puppy?
Friendship ended with human. New pupper is my new bestfriend. 
My ice cold heart... It's melting
ah, my replacement has arrived
Labrador or golden retriever? 
Leather universal seat cushions, any model can be used, 5 sets can be shipped
this is cute
Two miracles!
Interesting cause in my experience with dogs, they usually don‚Äôt like newcomers at first. Like, ‚Äúthis house always was all mine, now i need to divide with someone?‚Äù

This dog is so welcoming üò≠
Hello kind redditor, may we have some more please?
Does anyone have the one hour uncut original please?
Dogs are awesome 
I NEED this with sound
The best thing you can do for your dog is to get them a dog.
I love the little "Oh, I'm supposed to be sitting" squats the big dog does. And then finally they get too excited and give in
Why no sound ?
Dogs are so pure! We don‚Äôt deserve them. 
I would react the same way if someone surprised me with a puppy

I cant believe how happy he is. Good lord. Now I might have to get two dogs.

I just love how happy he got.
My heart just melted. 
OP, if you actually know these people can you please pass along that we've noticed how excellently they seem to handle both these dogs? And please tell them congrats on their growing family!
Thank you. Made me smile  
This is one of the happiest things I‚Äôve ever felt watching a video 
If any of you reading this have never been around a decently trained Golden retriever when they are happy and excited, get your shit together. They are like this gif 100% in real life.
Do dogs just love each other automagically? Like that puppy isn't missing his siblings and mom cuz oh look another dog and they're all the same? :(
What a lovely moment for them.
That was amazing to watch. Older dog is an absolute gem.
There is so much love in that home.
I think he likes it

Is there a full vid of this?

Please deliver.
Dogs are the best. 
So lovely, I want a dog now.
What's It feel like to be upgaraded 
Oh my god
Absolutely precious.

Oh boy oh boy oh boy
the little is her child?
The patience with which the guy/gal waits...man, that dog is well trained. The pup is lucky to have those two, (three) as lucky as they are to have him (the pup).
Has the puppy got a shock collar on?
Is it normal for a dog to have seizures?
I will love him and pet him and call him George
Best aww I‚Äôve seen in foreverbb

*Finally*, someone to do my bidding!
Goldens have the **best** smiles! 
Golden retrievers are the best boyes

I wish I could be this happy about anything.
That is adorable
Watching that shit... I can only feel love.
This made me laugh and cry out loud at the same time. For real!
Omg look at that tail lol I love it 
Amazing!!!
The bog dog is so cute. 

But that puppy is one miserable bugger.
"REALLY??? FOR ME???!!!!"
Oh my god, my heart just melted, i had goldens growing up they are the best dogs, thank you for sharing this, stuff like this always brightens my day
It pains me to know that I will never be as happy as that dog is in this video.
Doggo: *Sees new pup* lose shit immediatly

Pupper: *Sees big doggo* lightly tap head and look to mom for help


I'm not remotely a dog person, but this was just really lovely. So much heart directed everywhere.
Such innocent joy
I shall call him, Mini-Me
Henlo i luv u
GIVE ME THEM
This is so precious that it made my eyes well up with tears. Seeing those two tails wag with pure, innocent joy and happiness melted my heart. 
I want to create 10 more accounts so I can upvote this 10 more times...

Big boy doesn‚Äôt even know what to do with himself...he‚Äôs just so happy!
TOO AWW
That is so sweet! Our lil mama Nina did the same thing when we brought Nala home. Nina was so excited at first then went straight into mommy mode and taught her everything about being a puppy, how to bark, play, clean herself, etc. Now 2 years later they are completely in seperable.
Awful happy, boss. Dog happy.
What souless monster is able to just stand there and not get in on the pets? The person to the left of the camera you should play Poker or something.
Stole it from its mother, wow.
This video just gets better the longer it goes on
It's a great sign that the older dog is being submissive. This is all you can hope for in this situation.
U can't afford even one :((
I love how he's spazzing out in pure happiness!
This makes me feel like my heart is about to burst because it's full of rainbows.
Holy shit that thing was so excited for that other thing
Wondering why she‚Äôs carrying the puppy in a bag...
Mood when i see my best friend
That was beautiful
It ends too soon. I could watch it for hours.
I have a 110lb German Shepard. I got a new kitten once. Turned out to be my dog's kitten. He bathed her, slept with her, and protected her. They are very best friends.
So that cat is Max's puppy. He knows her by that phrase. 
"You got me a puppy!" 
Pure joy 
Happiness!
so cute

r/dogsgettingdogs
Haha, this reaction is so genuine! That's beautiful!
That was priceless
Aww fuck! Now I'm all sad thinking about the inevitable day when the old good boye leaves and the new good boye is sad as fuck. üòûüòü
Omg ..I can feel his happiness as I just won billion dollars lottery.
"You're so precious I'm dying!"
This dog is so pure hearted ‚ô•Ô∏è
She brought the dog in shopping bag? O.o
I'm now convinced that we bred pure happiness into golden retrievers.
Aww, I did this with my black lab and gave her a black lab puppy. It was the sweetest thing except they both started peeing little squirts over the floor from sheer excitement even though my black lab was trained to not do that.
His reaction could not have been better 
Not what I expected. Pleasantly surprised.  Very cute!
Best thing I will see all day I'm sure!
What makes this really lovely for me is the older best friend rolling on its back to show its not a threat to the new best friend. Dogs are just the best man.
Patient boy
I gotta check the wawas around here again. I seem to have missed the adorable dog section.
So cute babies <3 <3
This is why I love golden retrievers
who's a good a boy who's a good boy

this little guys a good boy yes yes a good boy.  oh boy 
What a sweet doggo! My Shih-tzu poodle (shih-poo, I shit you not) would've been trying to hump the new guy...
love this
I want this life
The hearts of men will never know such joy. We just aren't capable.
Awwww.
I‚Äôve always wanted to get my dog a puppy
This is too pure for my cold dead heart
I wish cats were this nice to each other when bringing a new pet into the house.
Far too adorable :)
Thank you for this! üôÇ
what a good boy
awwwwww :) 
You got a grocery dog
my dog had a fit for 3 days when we got our 2nd dog. now they besties tho 
This is gorgeous. What a beautiful family.
The level of joy in that room has reached critical mass!
Can we classify this as a gif that ends too soon? 
Even the good boye can't withstand the cuteness.
*Don‚Äôt pee on the floor don‚Äôt pee on the floor don‚Äôt pee on the floor*

-Dog lays head on floor directly beneath puppy

*DON‚ÄôT PEE ON THE FLOOR DON‚ÄôT PEE ON THE FLOOR DON‚ÄôT PEE ON THE-* 
OMG!  I knew the birth control didn't work I'm sooooo glad :)
I shall hug him and love him and squeeze him and pet him and call him George. 
Even dogs get excited about puppies 
haha that excitement!
Aww! Look at him! No dominating body language, all welcoming. The new dog looks a bit like he's wondering where the hell they found such an excited adult, but he's not going to say anything against it.
25 seconds in.

‚ÄúOH MY GOD IT HAS LEGS TOO!‚Äù
I just love how happy everyone is in this video
Human put that pup down already I want to play! 
Didn't know you could buy puppies at Whole Foods.
Really? No way. No way. No way.  He's mine!? No way. Reeallllyyyyy!? üòÜ
I wish my dog didn't loathe puppies. 
Insta-smile video
I love that the grown dog is acting more like a puppy than the puppy...

when the big dog acts like the real puppy
Goodness this was too adorable üíû
I see that puppy attitude is contagious. <3
You can tell he's going to be a good brother 
I is friend, I rollover to show you
Dogs are the best.. a cat would have plotted at least 12 scenarios by now in which the new puppy has an ‚Äûaccident‚Äú 
‚ÄúYou got me a puppy‚Äù =D
This is very cute but I am confusion why she brought the small dog in a paper bag?
And there goes my goal of not tearing up every time I see an r/aww post with cute dogs.... Damn you! I LOVE IT!!! 
That's awesome. 
lol if the pup is a male then it's gonna fuk the big female in like a year( have experience with this )
Is that a static electrical spark at 0:49?
Puppy: ‚ÄúIs this what I‚Äôm gonna look like when I get old?‚Äù
When we introduced my first son to the baby he did the same thing
He got so excited :D
‚ÄúHI FREN! Let‚Äôs play now! Look - a roll trick!‚Äù
I think we all know who really got a new puppy. 
Dogs are so pure, aren't they. My own dad gave about 1/5 of that excitement and happiness at my birth. The fuck 
He's freakin out! 
r/DGDAG :)
Why do people have to put puppies inside bags or boxes first?
I wish I had the social skills of that dog
I need a montage of this friendship
Holy fuck goldens are the best....
This one is a lot better than the original with all the dumb ass captions. 
Awwww isn‚Äôt this just the sweetest!!
This is aDORABLE!!!
u/SchoondleDoodleDo 
I love goldens.
"I bet you a puppy I could eat that puppy in one bite."

He's just so cute. 
Had a shitty day, this is what I needed :)
Labs never grow up do they? They are wonderful dogs.
This is the sweetest thing I've ever seen.
"A mini me!"
Such pure joy. 
That was so cute.
Cuteness overload.
r/eyebleach
Can't stop watching this.
This is so adorable
This makes my heart melt 
Best thing I've seen all day
I‚Äôm probably just insane. I am a day late to the party but at second 49-50 the paw of the dog moves across the chest of the puppy and creates a spark. 

Fuck, For the life of me I can‚Äôt think of a good one liner for this situation... 

this level of 'awwww' registers on the richter scale!
FRIENDSHIP WITH HUMANS OVER

PUPPY IS MY NEW BEST FRIEND
I wonder if the other wolves in a pack react like this when a mother comes out of her den with new pups.
too cute
Puppy to adult dog, "wow, you have absolutely no chill."
Love dogs So Much.

I can actually picture the green smiley face from the original Zoo Tycoon.

Dog: "BEST. DAY. EVER."
Meeting his eventual replacement :/
why is the dog in a shopping bag? Did she buy him at a supermarket?
A-friggin-dorable! 
***E X C I T E D***
Dats so cute.

Doggo wanted to play with new fren so bad.
"Ya like dags?"
"Dags?"
"Yeah, dags!"
"Oh, dogs. Yeah, I like dags."
Bestest boy gets bestest puppy
Dog always the best friend of human.
Doggo's reaction makes it feels like he saw his younger self again. Btw why is there a giant pole behind the TV?
If I had those two dogs, I'd give them both up if I could go down on my knees like that. God my knees are fucked up.
Know what would make this even cuter? If people like op would STOP BUYING PUREBRED DOGS WHICH ARE INBRED AF, AND ACTUALLY ADOPTED DOGS INSTEAD!
