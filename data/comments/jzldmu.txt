With boots and a trot like that I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre off to a rave
I know little to nothing about horses. Would these horses ever be used for riding? I don‚Äôt mean like in the park or for pleasure, but maybe for war?
Everyone's saying if you take the Faron High Road out west, you'll find a giant horse in the Taobab Grassland.
That horse better be named either peanut or tank
It looks like he's wearing a pair of black Ugg boots.

Edit: two pairs of Ugg boots. With the fur
I know this for a fact but... eveytime I see a horse I think "they're big as fuck". Now imagine one of these running towards you w/ full armor and shit!
Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk im a woman's man no time to talk
This is what I imagine a Ryshadium to be.

That horse had to *duck* to get through a *barn door*
I couldn't get close bcs I'm scared shitless by horses, but damn this one is majestic! And beautiful!
MAJESTIC
Draft horse. They are historically bred to do work pulling heavy carts, plowing or other farm labour.

One draft can typically pull 8,000lbs, but in tandem if two work together they can pull in excess of 24,000lbs+.

 I've seen a draft horses 6-in-hand (6 tied together) pull a log up a hill I couldn't even walk up myself. Absolutely incredible animals.

My Enormous Pony.
Im a big dude, and growing up I had a friend who had a horse and always wanted to take me riding with her.  I never felt comfortable riding out there as they used english saddles and it just didn't feel right, plus the horses were too fast (for me).  They had an older quarterhorse that they kept in the same stable and I happened to be there once when the owner was in.  I asked her if she minded if I took the horse out and she was all about it because she didn't get out there as much as she liked.

Horses name was Tex.  Quarter horses aren't really for riding, more for pulling things, but this dude liked to ride.  No saddle, just a blanket.  I climbed up the stable wall to get on his back.  Legit the Cadillac of horse riding, and I got to do it many times over a few years.  10/10 would ride again.
Uh, do you mean magical or majestic? I guess it is also prettiful grack in color by that measure.
Are big horses like big dogs, with a shorter life expectancy?

What the FUCK is majestical?
This reminds me of years ago and my first horseback riding experience.  My then girlfriend LOVED horses. So for her birthday we went to a place that gave lessons. There were a few others there that day and as the instructor was giving directions on how to get on and handle the horse I noticed she kept looking at me. It was obvious by the end she was checking me out and I have to admit I was feeling pretty studly.  The instructor was borderline beautiful.  We were handed waivers and this ballsy beauty pulls me aside. My then girl was so excited she just signed away and began petting the horses oblivious to this near dear penthouse experience that was unfolding. I stood off to the side, already paid for the experience mind you, when the instructor says, "how much do you weigh?". Well Captain Stud got deflated quickly. I wasnt being checked out. He was being sized up. Im 6'5 and 260. She told me I was 255 that day. The weight limit. I protested saying I didnt want to make the horse buckle under my girth. She told me not to worry.  Then everyone got on their horses. There was no horse for me. Once again my girl was oblivious.  So happy. Then the instructor says, " Bring out Cleetus." And a horse just like the one in this video appeared. It reminded me of the Budweiser horses. It was more than twice the size of the others.  The instructor promised me Cleetus was the best. All I thought was, "Yeah I got the fat guy horse." But Cleetus WAS the best. He listened.  Followed my commands and took me on a great ride. Other horses strayed, others stopped to eat, but Cleetus stayed the course. So I may of got the fat guy horse but I got the BEST horse that day. Giddyup.
People always underestimate the size of horses but holy shit that boy looks HUGEEE
I bet that horse pulls 20 horse power
Poor guy has hair in his eyes! Glad he didn't hit his head in the doorway

For some reason, this big fella reminds me of Geralt from The Witcher.
Is that, like, a Clydesdale horse mated with a fucking GIANT?!
If that horse was in a fantasy movie and you told me it was cgi, I would believe you.
Remove the -al at the end of majestic and you got the right word.
