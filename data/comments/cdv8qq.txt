There's a bear refuge in Croatia?! What part? Is it something I can come visit when I'm back in the area??
This is amazing. Like a scene from a children's book.
That bear looks super pissed that some damn kids are on his lawn! This is awesome though! Is this refuge a place the public can go to and see them chilling? I‚Äôm visiting Croatia next year and am trying to compile a list of things to do while there.
It looks so beautiful there and peaceful, 

This is a dumb question but why‚Äôs the bears water so green and looks like a weird texture?
My favorite part of this post is how you add little facts in people‚Äôs comments..  you‚Äôre clearly passionate about this and it‚Äôs awesome to see.  May I have a bear fact now?
r/blessedimages
He is beautiful!! Please tell him that I love him and hope he is happy.
Living the dream eh Boo-boo ?
He‚Äôs thinking about slugging back some vodka and eating salmon with the boys
r/bearsdoinghumanthings
hey, I've been there few years back. It's truly an amazing place! :) Are you on an EVS placement?

Big chilling
Does a bear shit in the water
That‚Äôs a good boy
[deleted]
Always happy to see posts on reddit about my Croatia :D
This bear has a better life than me.
Pfff! This spa sucks. She doesn't even have cucumbers on her eyes.
He looks like hes on a proper spa day.... This is un**bear**ably adorable
How many bears are in this refuge?
Do you have any links for donations?
OP, do you know this bear's story?
https://visit-lika.com/en/page/kuterevo-bear-sanctuary
> Am bear. But why am bear?

-- That bear, probably.
I read that as beer refuge and was wondering why a bear was chilling in the beer hot tub.
That's great. I was born a few hours due east from there on the border of Bosnia and Croatia. Enjoy the rakija and make sure you enjoy it with Dalmatinski Pr≈°ut and Livanjski sir (prosciutto from dalmatia and cheese from Livno).
I work in IT but I like bears.

Do your bears require IT Support?
That look on her face lol. Try it in r/photoshopbattles
The heat looks unbearable out there...
Yogi's really stepped it up a notch with the pic-a-nics lately!
"It's rude to take pictures of others in the bath, Luka." - Bear, probably
He's so solemn, it looks like he's contemplating all of his life decisions.
How is he not ripping you to shreds? I'd be terrified.
r/bears wants to know your location.
That's the look I have on my face when I'm pondering life choices.
What a r/madlad
All this bear needs, is cucumber eye slices, and a mimosa!

Edit: typo
This is MY SWAMP
Just the bear necessities.
You can tell that this bear needed this day at the spa. He was about to dismember that damn project manager that keeps riding his ass.
He looks like hes either enjoying your company or has had enough of your shit
Kuterevo, Velebit Mountain.
I see that Yogi Bear is enjoying his retirement
üéµlook for the bear necessities

The simple bear necessities 

Forget about your worries and your strifeüéµ
Bears must give each other gift vouchers for this place as birthday and anniversary presents
‚ÄúDid I leave my phone in my pocket?‚Äù
Im from Croatia! 
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
I'd go for the chillaxers
This bear has a better vacation plan than I do.
I thought only Polar bears could be that chill.
A bear Spa!!! How cool is that!?!
When you just woke up and are in the shower and you‚Äôre way too tired but have to go to work anyway, so you just stare dead-eyed into the middle-distance for awhile
Haha I read this as "beer refuge" and was very confused xD
Post on r/croatia :)
Do bears make good pets? I‚Äôd like to invite this guy to the crib.
actually doesn't look like he's enjoying himself, like he just realized he forgot to take his phone out of his pocket.
That bear can't remember if they unplugged the iron.
I already know this is gonna be some sort of meme format
can this refuge be visited?
That Bear really needs to change the water in his pool.
I am from Croatia, I remember when I was 8 years old, we were going on a school trip in Kuterevo. Beautiful place. I even had a wooden bear souvenir.
Is that at Macola? I was there (i live 150 km southeast) and the bears are more cultured than many people i met.
That bear looks very Croatian.
Contemplating which person's face he'll swat off next.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh I wish I knew about it earlier, when I went to Zadar. Will definitely visit you, when I go back (hopefully this summer). Are you open over weekends too?
Hey I'll be in Croatia next month and love bears! Where is it?
Zakon fotka !  


\*Awsome photo
That bear looks chill as a capybara.
Are there bears in Croatia? Apart from this one
Now I know the bear is just relaxing but his face looks like he would fuck you up
He looks so peaceful
*the bear necessities intensifies*
‚ÄúI should buy a boat‚Äù...
Well? Aren't volunteers supposed to bathe them? Get busy
This bear looks so haggard. Like he‚Äôs seen some shit in his day.
Him doin a bathe
Bear needs a beer
U just made my day. Thanks :)
I'm just curious. Why is the color of the water so.... unusual?
I think the pool filtration system is not working
This is such a nice little place ! A few days ago I visited and can recommend anyone to go if your close by. Seeing the young cubs play in the water was really nice
I'm not buying this bath water either...
That bear looks like it gets 30 minutes of time to itself a day,away from typical bear issues, and damn if it‚Äôs not going to use those whole 30 minutes.
This artwork is named "Bear in Guacamole".
This has got some meme potential
Club Medved.
Take a poor mans medal. üèÖ
Why is it sitting in a pool of guacamole?
Looks like he's on a get-away spa-weekend, from an annoying girl called Masha...
I'm gonna pet it
This bear looks like he had a stressful day tbh. I'm glad he's having some personal time to relax.
This is a totally awesome photo. That is all
Sir Bearington?
Sadly too far away for me at the moment as i'm from Germany üòî but i was in Croatia like 13 years ago
"Chillaxing" I like that word, hopefully it picks upm great picture btw. Thanks for volunteering
Been there a month ago actually, maybe you were the one that was guiding me and my class then :P
That bear seems to be saying ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the bubbles Karen....you promised me bubbles.....I need the damn bubbles!!‚Äù
Last time I was in that country was when the UN sent us in to break up the warring parties Bosnia-Herzegovina Croatia you could see it was a wonderful country once.. glad to see some good people taking care of it there .. glad to see your taking care of the animals of the country
Hey I helped build this bear pool!!! I volunteered in 2009, and this was a part of our project. 

The trip changed my life and spark a multi-year trip around the world. I even got Kuterevo tattood on my side as a reminder of the significance of the trip.
Are there other volunteer opportunities in Croatia I could apply for? I'm Croatian, but from the US and would love to do something like this!
Crazy picture. I actualy thought the bear was a _statue_ for a second, dunno why. The broken branch looks like someone got a little _too_ adventurous lol
I‚Äôm looking into tickets to fly to Croatia and took a break to look at Reddit. 
I am now even more excited about my vacation than before.
üòë
Moj ƒáaƒáa heheheh
Oh god! Totally have to visit this place!
Aw so awesome to see this place on Reddit, I visited there once with my parents when I was about 10, hope I can come back soon
why is the water so dirty?
‚ÄúFelt cute, might delete later‚Äù
I love this photo. I keep coming back to it because it's so good.
Me on a daily basis üòÖ
I can‚Äôt bear how cute this is
Shiit I am from Croatia and didnt even know this existed until now..you learn something every day
Heading to split next week. Hiring a car just to come here! Can't wait!!!!
Where can I donate?
I just came back from Croatia... No one told me there was fucking bears üòê
I am from Croatia, this makes me really happy. Thank you kind stranger.
Chilaxing lad seems like such a Croatian thing to say.

I'm not saying this as a bad thing, i think it's cute.

Edit: I don't understand how this could be interpreted other than a nice thing. I'm sorry it's not an "awwww so cute" pun comment.
I had no idea there are bears that far south in Europe
Shrek ?
This is awesome!
It‚Äôs Baloo from the Jungle book.
Someone get this bear a beer!
*Stop it Karen I'm tryna have some personal time !*
How can I do to being volunteer too?
This photo vibe is awesome
What city? Coming From a Croatian
Read it as beer at first but happy with bear.
what a chill lad!!
I‚Äôm going to be honest, it took me a while to notice the bear because that bird above the bridge made me think there was a tiny bit of crud on my phone screen that I spent 30 seconds trying to clean off.
This bear is not only living his best life, I think he stole my best life too!
[same aura](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uo2SNtFofWI/maxresdefault.jpg)
This bear looks like he‚Äôs questioning every life choice he ever made.
this is unbearable
That's my kind of bear.  He bathes in Matcha tea.
That looks like Paddington's aunt.
Looks so real
The bear necessities of life üòÜ
Wonder what the guys are doing at the Honey Factory right now.
I would really like more information about the place you volunteer for, what you think of the experience and how you got the gig!!

Thanks for you post.
how cool is that?
Looks like he's in a spa.
That bear lives better than I ever will
That bear looks like it's wondering where the waiter is with his drink.

Can't stop wondering how stable that roof is lol
I read the title as if written by the bear. Was not disappoint Edit: (too much)
Those simple bear necessities
Where is this and how did you apply? I live in croatia and never heard of this
It looks like he's sitting in pea soup.
you are doing such a great job there. thank you.
"I should stop pooping in the pool"
That bears seems to be near ascension to a new plane of existence somehow...
This is where Luis Litt got the idea!
Bear: ... Did I leave the gas on?
He's just missing some beets and battlestar galactica.
I'll be in croatia this summer and I have plans to drop by!!!
Even a bear has a vacation... What about me? :)
He looks like Thanos, watching the sun rise on a just universe.
Hopefully  you not the massage therapist
I wanna volunteer at a bear refuge, how do you get into that?
Where is that exactly?
He ain't relaxed at all. He's thinking about the rent, Greg.
OP, why are you posting a picture of my wife at the spa? Seriously though, that looks like a sweet opportunity!
Stop chilling in the pool and get back to work.
This is the most Russian looking bear I've ever seen.
This is so surreal
Wait they have bears in Croatia? Should I be worried about travelling alone?
This bear is so Zen.
I love Gurahl!
Is that a bear in a mud bath?  This is more of a bear day spa.
Why are the bears at your refuge? Are they rescued from tourism industry, injured or did they loose their habitat? Something else?

Also, what is their personality like?
I think he fell hot
This bear has a better life than me.   
Thanks OP for your help to preserve nature

Extreme Tuesday mood and wonderful lad!
Well, he‚Äôs got the bear necessities.
He wasn't brown when he got in, but he is now.
Where you from neighbor?
Awesome. What are the chances of seeing a bear if we come for a visit?
Beats aren't real
I want to volunteer too
Wait there‚Äôs Bears in croatia? Wtf
"Why so serious??". He looks mad. I don't think he wanted to take a mud bath.
I needed this today.
If this doesn't reach to the top of the front page, I'm deleting my Reddit. It's a fucking bear sitting so calmy. It's perfection.
You can pay good money for a spa treatment like that
What city? Ive been to a few cities in croatia before
That bear is thinking about all the life choises that lead up to this moment
Please post more bear pics!
This bear looks pretty content with his life
That looks on it face. It really on relaxation mood.
Kuterevo here I come :D can't believe how magnificent it looks like

I wanna volunteer! I can be in croatia this october.
I am in croatia on vacation w my family.

My friend and I are visiting Croatia soon!! Where is this?
There's nothing to be afraid of it's just good clean mud.
My man is out here having a mud bath, living life. I love it
I would buy his bathwater
Everyone needs a spa day from time to time, even the bears

Svaka ƒçast. I like the "fence"to keep the visitors safe.

Quality content
Mood.
This thread is so cool. I'll be sure to drive down with my friend next time I'm in ZG
Good to see retirement is treating Baloo well.
Cool
When I see pictures like this I think what the human species would be like had we descended from bears instead of apes.
I too like a good ole fashioned peanut butter bath.
i love him
He looks displeased üòÇ
Meda rastura, visio bih sa njim haha

Something about this picture relaxes me. I feel like I should frame it.. that's kinda weird though

"I should buy a boat..."

wtf is his damn water slide? i mean....seriously?! How the hell is he supposed to get down?
He should buy a boat
Thank you
Can you share more pics? I‚Äôm curious
This would make a good album cover
The backstory and the environment of this place seems straight out of a Pokemon game. Magnificent.
Do the bears let you approach them?
Thank you for posting this, you have brought back some wonderful memories for me. I visited this sanctuary a few years ago and had a wonderful day. The area is so beautiful, and everybody there cared so much for these amazing creatures.
I WANT TO WORK AT A BEAR REFUGE AND CHILL WITH MR BOBO THERE. LOOK AT HIM!!!!
Good people of reddit, someone's got to put a fancy drink with a little umbrella in that picture!
This is going to sound dumb, but he's such a perfectly bear-shaped bear. At a glance I thought someone had put a bear statue in a pond.
No way in fuck am I getting that close to a grizzly
New life goal... be as chilled out as that bear lol
I want to work there please.
Is he in the mood to share the tub?
Mud bath
Are all the bears at the refuge from the same species or are they diffrent species? Here in Sweden the only bear we have is brown bear, is it the same?
r/bearsdoinghumanthings
the way his eyes are closed is the best part to me. He looks like he‚Äôs meditating, totally zen.
Aww look at that relaxing face.
r/bearsdoinghumanthings
The bear looks pretty chill
I thought it was a put put course at first.
What was left of that poor tree has become a bath toy...
He doesn‚Äôt look relaxed at all
Could you tell us more about the process of volunteering there? Contact, application, requirements... For anyone who is interested in doing that as well (maybe that's me).
Bear soup
Buy some beer, call over some girls, and you have yourself a fun night ;) üëâüëå
Why does the bear look animatronic?
\-1 bc you thought using the word ‚Äú*chilax*‚Äù would impress the older boys.
Someone grab this mother fucker an Ice cold beer and a jazz cigarette!
Simple bear necessities
Dat boi wants a beer.
That high tech fence is going to keep everyone safe.
Is that bear in split pea soup?
That bear looks like he‚Äôs too old and too tired for everyone‚Äôs shit.
Face says "No tips".
It‚Äôs a beautiful place! My girlfriend and I have been there last summer. The trip to the place is also very beautiful, up in the hills. We bought some of the liquor they sold, they brew it themselves and hand painted the bottles, it‚Äôs very nice! 

When we were there, we saw the blind female bear, forgot her name. How is she doing?
Absolute mad lad!
"Hey, baby. Come on in. The water's green."
Are donations only accepted onsite, or is there a website we can visit to donate?
You were pretty close to him, didn't you? Do they chill when you're around or is more like how they feel that they? Keep uploading and keep taking care of them ‚ô•Ô∏è
" I Should buy a boat"
I hope someday I can look as wise as this bear.
Chad bear.
Yea, am bear. 

But some days, why am bear?

Is there more than bear?
I‚Äôve been having a not so awesome morning and this just made it better. Thank you for sharing this wonderful photo. I hope the bear leaves y‚Äôall a 5 star review!
I will never be as relaxed as this bear
Heavy meme potential. /r/MemeEconomy
how do i sign up for this
That bear is chillin
It‚Äôs some kind of Hot Cub Slime Machine.
I could see this becoming a meme
Dude I‚Äôm so interested in going there, but I was just wondering: Are they just chilling and walking around in the wild there? If I visit how can I be sure I‚Äôm not eaten alive...?
What do you do at this refuge and how do you volunteer? I am looking at a change in career path soon
The facial expression of this bear is so cute and funny in the same time haha !
This lifts my spirit up! Thanks!
‚ÄúI am bear. But why am I bear? What does being a bear actually mean?‚Äù 

His look is extremely philosophical
Croatia this time of year might be the most beautiful place In the world no cap
Bear:

>If I sit completely still, maybe the person with the camera will go away.
Ah yes, ≈Ωeljko, I've met him. Good guy. Friends call him Bear.

Is joke, everyone bear in Croatia
Bears are so cute. Especially when they are friendly around humans. They‚Äôre just big fluffy people
What kind of bird is that
It's retired pooh hanging on the honey
Lmao the bear doesn't give a fuuuuuuuuuuuck he's so relaxed ü§£ 
Thanks for sharing this with us mate!
What a chill lad. I‚Äôd chill with that lad.

Ayyy my fellow country man, sup!
Question. What kind of bear is best?
That Looks Like A Croatian Bear.

 If that means anything.
This is now my favorite post on the internet. Thanks for sharing this and your obvious passion for bears.

QUESTION: Ever had a close encounter with a bear that may have ended badly? Did this guy notice you were there or didn‚Äôt care?
How do you take care of the bears without putting yourself in danger?

Man he is all sorts of reflecting on his life choices
It looks really cute, you should upload more pics with bears, i bet you have a lot going on there
I read it as beer refuge I was so confused lol. Bear refuge makes a whole lot more sense. Looks amazing.
This is too wholesome for the interweb.
this dude looks like yakuza boss
My family is from Croatia! My great great grandfather came to America from there several generations ago. I don't hear about Croatia much, and nobody I tell has even heard of it. It looks like a beautiful place, but I've never had the chance to go back and visit.
I wonder if he is thinking "That Kermit guy always complains about how hard it is to be green. Try being a brown bear in Croatia sometime....."
Cute bear
lol it kinda looks like it‚Äôs having an existential crisis or something
In awe, at the size of this lad
"Karen, where's my Mojito?!?!"

The bear has a bruh can you like not imma having a good private time in the bath. Why you gotta be invading my privacy. I sell you bath water shoo
Is it bathing in cream of spinach?
Are they playful? With humans? Give us some videos!!
That's why a bear can rest at ease, with just the bare necessities of life
"I used to be someone, you know."
thats a cursed queen
That bear is living better than me.
I just woke up four minutes ago and aside from from some texts from my friend this is the first thing I see. It's only going to go downhill from here.

Give him a big hug for me and all of Reddit
Great idea doing holidays while volunteering
Good for life- good for your own karma- good for the example you give! God bless my friend!! Be the change you want to see in the world.
I‚Äôve got nothing to add other than saying that Croatia is the most beautiful place I‚Äôve ever visited. The buildings, the landscapes, the people... it‚Äôs just beautiful. Even the bears!
Ah i wish i knew about this a few weeks ago , i spent 3 weeks in split dubrovnik zadar and a bunch of other places, i totally would of stopped by!
everyone into the bear-poo pool!
A bear in pea soup.  Good therapy!
Clean that water lol
Wow my friend is in Croatia right now I better tell him to go

And now I'm jealous of a bear...

Good lord, I want to meet your bear friend.  Like so much!

He looks very serious about his bath.  I love this.

The bear reminds me of Will Ferrell
Damn that water looks gross.
Heeeeyyy! what's up in Kuterevo! the new enclosure must be finish now?... great souvenirs there.
Nice
Wait what? So you can walk around the refuge & the bears are just chilling?

‚ÄòHey john can I get some smoked salmon with some berries on the side in the mud bath in about 20 mins‚Äô

‚ÄòYes no problem mr bear.‚Äô 

That‚Äôs awesome

I'm from Croatia and I didn't even know this exists. Cool!
Hey man, OP. What is going on with Macola‚Äôs bears? I know it was in the news couple months ago. Do you know?
This bear is bathing in pea soup.
I think he is mediating...
Wow that's amazing! It reminds me of the bear hideout on top of grouse mountain, in Vancouver.
Why does the water look so dirty?
 Amazing
Is that mud? If so that‚Äôs a very smart bear! He‚Äôs cooling off
"I should have bought a boat"
this is awesome! is it ok if I try to paint it? it will no way be realistic but seems like a fun project!
Uhm do you take baths with them?! (I know you don‚Äòt but I want it to be true so I could do it too)

Feeling grateful to be apart of history when this reaches top post ever
I wish there was a sub where people could post all the interesting and unique volunteering roles that are out there
My husband and i go to Croatia once a year or so, and we‚Äôll definitely be visiting next time! This is so cool!
Wow, I always forget that Croatia has bears!
What kind of bear is that?
I love my pea soup with bears.
This is just amazing!
Looks more like a bear spa to me.
How close can you get to the bears, and how tame are they? It looks magical.
This is one of the pictures I‚Äôve ever seen on Reddit. It‚Äôs just so pure and sweet.
I‚Äôm so curious about what kind of souvenirs you sell at the refuge.
You know, I always assumed humans had wiped out bears completely in Europe, like with wolves. Good to see they‚Äôre still around and have some nice digs.
He needed new water.
Does the sanctuary have a online page or online donation page where it can be donated? 

I get that the sanctuary is maintained by donations so I‚Äôm sure there would be a couple of people here who would like to donate.
Have you ever seen them fart? As in bubbles in the water.
This has to be a meme template, c'mon!
'I should buy a boat.'
That look just screams ‚ÄúDamnit Peter, put the camera down‚Äù
I read this as beer refuge... then I saw the picture and was like ...wtf is a bear doing at a beer...nvm
My brain read this as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a volunteering bear in a refuge‚Äù and the picture made perfect sense
That bear looks like he's silently talking smack about another bear
Do bears need refuge? They are fucking bears. They do what they want.
Look at that wise boi just chilling and living
Pazi se!
Good bear
Bear spa.
Looks like a minigolf course
I know people say this about a lot of pictures...but this could definitely be an album cover
Is that pea soup?
This is grade A meme material.

doin thangs
Spa frivolous, nah no way. Bare necessities my dude
Many people wish to be as chill as him
Just remember though guys, bears are animals and will fuck you up. Stay clear of them in the wild
That water looks like the water in Brazil Olympics
That face says a thousand words.
‚ÄúI should buy a boat.‚Äù
When you're in the tub trying to decompress from being yelled at by customers for 8 hours
I don't particularly like bears, but I would drive several hours out of my way to visit this place if I was ever in Croatia.
I have strong evidence that an animal pooped in that pool and it has not been cleaned.
Well, that bear is having a better time than I am...
Cannot bear the publicity, no photo.
In a Yogi Bear voice....

"Hey boo boo bring me a picnic basket anh!"
Now bears are getting more spa time then me... Great!
Super cool
His face is just precious. Thanks for sharing--I'd love to see more photos/videos.
did that actually happen??
God I wished I worked at a bear refuge in Croatia
I bet the work is unbearable.
r/bearsdoinghumanthings
Are you a bear?
Please get in and take one with your arms around him.
How is the process for volunteering? What is a normal day at your job?
 
I would really like to volunteer in something like this
How awesome, thanks for sharing!
This is my aesthetic
May i please start using this as a reaction image
He just waiting for the bubbles to start and his ice-cold beer to arrive.
How would one go about volunteering there?
At first I thought it said Climaxing lad üò≤
Dude, you did more for Croatian tourism in one reddit post than Croatian government with couple of million euros of tax money.
SGT GRUMBLES!!!!
He looks like he just had a very profound and sobering thought.

Bear: "Honey comes from bees, but where do bees come from?"
This is why I come to reddit.
The bear be thinking; Ili jesam ili nisam zatvorio vrata
Kuma looks like he has something on his mind.
Do you guys have instagram? If not know that people would love to see daily pics and videos of the refuge! It'd also be an easy way to promote your donations page
Jebeno
I can just imagine the bears opening their emails and thinking...‚Äùthis has to be a scam‚Äù
He seems likes he‚Äôs really trying to workout some serious shit in his head.
I would totally be that bear if the water was clean.  Maybe I just don't understand what that green stuff is supposed to be.
The bear looks like he did fart a bit to hart into the water ü§£
That bear has a face on! ‚ÄúDid i leave the stove on before leaving the cave ?‚Äù
r/bearsdoinghumanthings
Waww!!!
Bear looks like he‚Äôs tired of your shenanigans.

‚ÄúKyle, you said no photos...‚Äù
Planning his scape üòÇ

I‚Äôm the only one who thinks that bear looks fake (not saying it is but it just looks like it to me)

Awesome how it just chills there
Is that bear sitting in a poo spa?
So jealous
Behold: Boog

The mighty grizzly
Woohoo!

Croatian here, nice to see Kuterevo represented here. Been there once, it was awesome to see the bears there.

We even left a Geocache there. Hope it got people to visit the bear refuge.
r/photoshopbattles
Can anyone volunteer? Like even people not from Croatia? Like can I visit for a week and volunteer as an American? 
Do they have a website? 
Omg so many questions.
Why do you always disturb my bathtime, Steve?
A bear refuge, for convalescing bears I'm assuming? Somewhere for them to get their heads together, finally finish work on the last few chapters of their novel?
So when can I buy some Croatian bear bath water?
Thankyou for doing such kind hearted work. Many people right of grown bears as scary predators so its amazing to see them being loved and taken care of. Ive always been curious and seems like a good time to ask... do bears enjoy getting touched at all (head scratches, belly rubs type stuff)?
r/bearsdoinghumanthings
If there was a Bear Instagram there would be what a Bear Influencer would look like!
Existential crisis
I am hoping your job isn't to clean the bear bath water...hehe
At first I thought it was a refuge FROM bears, so seeing the Absolute Unit‚Ñ¢ in what I assumed was some kind of relaxing pool for refugees was awkward at first.

This should be a meme image please
Heads up, the Instagram account **chonky.animals** just posted your photo without a credit :(
That bear is contemplating life.
