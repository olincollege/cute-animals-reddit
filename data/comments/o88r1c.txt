I may never march with the infantry, purr with the cavalry, scratch the artillery but I'm in the cat's army
Turkish feline troopers are getting there. This reveal of the secret.goverment project surely the rest of the world will counter with their own version of this

Infantry win firefights. Tanks win battles. Artillery  wins wars. Kittens win hearts.

Plot twist: the cat was doing an inspection of the troops on their marching.
<squeaky mew>

WHO SAID THAT?   Who the F! Said that?!  Which one of you fluffy nosed twinklepaws dared mew in MY barracks!  Was it YOU Private Mittens?  Answer me!

<mew>

Alright FINE!  You can have your precious ball of yarn, but so help me to Dog you better not play in the litterbox or I will CRAZY GLUE the statuettes to the windowsill this time!  Do you HEAR ME Pvt!?

Do Turkish people really love cats or something?  I see so many videos of cats in Turkey living it up.

He looks just like my Joey boy. I miss that cat 😭
Cutie ☺️
He was one of my best Soldiers. Unfortunately, he pissed hot for catnip and there was nothing I could do. Commander put him up for adoption.

Reminder - turkey loves their kit tee cats.

And do you remember Mark Twains quote about cats?
When a man loves cats, I am his friend and comrade, without further introduction.
I'm a simple man: i see a cat, i upvote
Turkish people really love cats.
Waiting for a cat expert redditor to tell us that this behaviour is actually due to a rare genetic disorder that causes tumours to grow in the brain's cerebellum and is actually not very cute at all.
She probably sees the hoomans marching in formation and thinks “Damn, they’re making biscuits on an *industrial* scale around here”
That is adorable

Somebody give that cat a Global War on Depression medal right away because its cuteness is too powerful to resist smiling.
That cat probably saved a lot of soldiers from depression.
*What Is Your Major Malfunction!*
Aw… cute little soldier kitty!
Love the comments lol
camera man says "you do it and he will do too" "do it do it*
My kitten wants to march BETWEEN my feet. I almost snapped her in half the other day.

I also have to keep the bathroom door closed, because if there is even one poo in her litter box, she'll go in the bathtub.
I love how serious it looks! Kittens are so endearing, when they're acting all cat-like :)
PRIVATE FUZZY! FALLING OUT OF FORMATION AGAIN?!
I was born on a Turkish military base. My father would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. And I still don't march like this. Good kitty!
I was about to post this but damn I'm too lazy.
OMG this is extremely cute!!
Nice
Until he gets bored and fucks off haha

Standard cat shit.
Hahaha so sweet
Cutest thing ive seen today!
That's so cute I could just REEEEEEEEEEEEE

The modern Sgt.Stubby! Stubby was a street dog that wandered onto a training base in the US during WWI. He marched, learned how to salute and was brought to France where he was instrumental in recognizing incoming artillery and even captured a German spy in the trenches!
This is adorable.

Turkey is actually a good place to be a cat. The Turkish people really love cats!
Why does it seem like cats outside of the States seem much more friendly and do stuff like this? Ah man
Turkishcats > all
That cat is a war hero. They are training the next generation
I didn't believe the title of this vid until I watched it.

These are my claws. There are many like them, but these ones are mine. My claws are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my litter tray.

It had to be Turkey.
One of the most protected cats in the world.

Fun fact: That cat is actually the leader of that base.

When countries go to war, send the cats, if they are cool with each other, then we have to work it out.
Most threatening Turkish soldier
why is it doing this ? it's so cute
The awwttoman empire strikes back!
Theese mofos cant even appreciate kitty cats without being Turkophobic, damn.
r/normaldayinistanbul  slow sub, but cats in Turkey.
I have extreme cultural respect and envy for how Turkish people treat their street kitties. It’s a true measure of civilization. I don’t want to sideline to any Turkish political concerns—ima just sit with Turks and their kedis.
Love this 🥺
Do not anticipate the order PTE Mittens
This made me day better! What a good little soldier-kitty!

Marching biscuits!
That there is one fine wiggly tailed biscuit maker! Carry on!
Do cats actually copy what they see others do?  I thought they didn’t do that.  So does this mean they must have trained the cat to march?

Cat see cat do

~~Marches~~ *makes biscuits*
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Dog taught to do the thing for 2 weeks: "I gotta do the thing! I gotta do the thing to be a part of the pack and make them happy!"  
  
Cat living with the thing its whole life: "Yea, alright I'll do the thing, you happy?? Again?! Ok, just a little. I got things to do."
We got our dog when he was a puppy and he's been raised by 2 cats. It's hilarious the things he's learned from them and when he is around other dogs they are thoroughly confused why this dog is playing like a cat
Tehn he get his 9mm Mewser, you know the one that goes MEW MEW MEW MEW
a disipawline cat
LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIG.... Oh a butterfly.
Please tell me his name is boots
Cats love to mimic humans by meowing, keyboard touching, and other stuff they see. It’s pretty hecking swag
I am Turkish and this made my day
WHY ARE YOU 

SO GOD DAMN CUTE 💗💞💓
That cat can mark time in step, I know some air cadets who stuggled with that!
