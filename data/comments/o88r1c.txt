Plot twist: the cat was doing an inspection of the troops on their marching.
<squeaky mew>

WHO SAID THAT?   Who the F! Said that?!  Which one of you fluffy nosed twinklepaws dared mew in MY barracks!  Was it YOU Private Mittens?  Answer me!

Alright FINE!  You can have your precious ball of yarn, but so help me to Dog you better not play in the litterbox or I will CRAZY GLUE the statuettes to the windowsill this time!  Do you HEAR ME Pvt!?

Do Turkish people really love cats or something?  I see so many videos of cats in Turkey living it up.

And do you remember Mark Twains quote about cats?
When a man loves cats, I am his friend and comrade, without further introduction.
I'm a simple man: i see a cat, i upvote
Turkish people really love cats.
Waiting for a cat expert redditor to tell us that this behaviour is actually due to a rare genetic disorder that causes tumours to grow in the brain's cerebellum and is actually not very cute at all.
She probably sees the hoomans marching in formation and thinks ‚ÄúDamn, they‚Äôre making biscuits on an *industrial* scale around here‚Äù
That is adorable

Somebody give that cat a Global War on Depression medal right away because its cuteness is too powerful to resist smiling.
That cat probably saved a lot of soldiers from depression.

Aw‚Ä¶ cute little soldier kitty!
Love the comments lol

My kitten wants to march BETWEEN my feet. I almost snapped her in half the other day.

I also have to keep the bathroom door closed, because if there is even one poo in her litter box, she'll go in the bathtub.
I love how serious it looks! Kittens are so endearing, when they're acting all cat-like :)
PRIVATE FUZZY! FALLING OUT OF FORMATION AGAIN?!
I was born on a Turkish military base. My father would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. And I still don't march like this. Good kitty!
I was about to post this but damn I'm too lazy.
OMG this is extremely cute!!
Nice
Until he gets bored and fucks off haha

Standard cat shit.

The modern Sgt.Stubby! Stubby was a street dog that wandered onto a training base in the US during WWI. He marched, learned how to salute and was brought to France where he was instrumental in recognizing incoming artillery and even captured a German spy in the trenches!
This is adorable.

Turkey is actually a good place to be a cat. The Turkish people really love cats!

I have extreme cultural respect and envy for how Turkish people treat their street kitties. It‚Äôs a true measure of civilization. I don‚Äôt want to sideline to any Turkish political concerns‚Äîima just sit with Turks and their kedis.

Marching biscuits!
That there is one fine wiggly tailed biscuit maker! Carry on!
Do cats actually copy what they see others do?  I thought they didn‚Äôt do that.  So does this mean they must have trained the cat to march?

~~Marches~~ *makes biscuits*
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Dog taught to do the thing for 2 weeks: "I gotta do the thing! I gotta do the thing to be a part of the pack and make them happy!"  
  
Cat living with the thing its whole life: "Yea, alright I'll do the thing, you happy?? Again?! Ok, just a little. I got things to do."
We got our dog when he was a puppy and he's been raised by 2 cats. It's hilarious the things he's learned from them and when he is around other dogs they are thoroughly confused why this dog is playing like a cat
Tehn he get his 9mm Mewser, you know the one that goes MEW MEW MEW MEW
a disipawline cat
LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIG.... Oh a butterfly.
