Big bad wolf on the outside. Puppy on the inside
I love how he turns over and lets her run his belly like a puppy dog. That wolf must have mad respect for this woman. I'd love to know the story of how she helped raise his pack..
My 9lb Pomeranian also extends a paw while i rub her belly
[deleted]
You may think you're badass, but you'll never be "giving belly rubs to a gorgeous grey wolf" badass
***Cmon just one belly rub........that never hurt anyone.***

**10,000 years later:**
It odd how well humans and wolves can get on. That's not a dog. That wolf hasn't been bred to love humans. Yet there he is showing another predator (an apex predator no less) his belly.
Ok, for real, the balls on our ancestors for seeing wolves like this and saying, "I'mma go tame this sumbitch".
I've never appreciated how effing huge wolves are!
Thats a big boy
I had a German Shepherd and a black lab as a kid. I had a uncle who swore that dogs wouldn't really protect their humans and would just run away or cry. My dad always told him he was so wrong. One day when my dad wasn't home my uncle was there and decided he was going to show me my dad was wrong. He made pretend to get loud and physical with my mom. The dogs attacked. Both. The black lab included. I always knew my shepherd was protective but the lab, just super playful. But they attacked. My uncle was never able to come into my home while those dogs were alive. What a asshole. 

My point is, I wonder what would happen if someone pretended to attack that woman. How long would they live?
I want to point out that wild animals like this don’t expose their bellies unless they completely trust the person/animal. It’s usually a sign of submission as well. This wolf trusts this woman with all its heart!!!
I know a direwolf when I see one. Winter is coming.

I grew up around this wolf center, back when they had far fewer wolves, and my family was great friends with the owner. I've played with their original wolf, Chinook, and watched them grow as a sanctuary as i grew up. This place is incredible, and the wolves are VERY much loved and cared for. My username, Sykarah, actually came from this wolf's mate, Sakara. Truly a beautiful place, a complete gem. I highly reccomend going if you ever have find yourself in Colorado!!!! This center changed my life. <3
Wolves are like the jason mamoas of the animal kingdom.
How do you help raise a wolf pack, I can't even have a potted plant in my house without it dying
My wife and I’ve been there and actually had a chance to feed and interact with another grey Timberwolf named Amarok. Got so many kisses from him. Absolutely amazing experience!
They're cute now, but remember that they can take down 600 pound elk.
Wolf showing his tummy is trusting this women with his life!
Dammit Moon Moon.
I can’t believe she didn’t follow proto and let that wolf lick in her mouth.
I've seen this many times on here and I hope I get to see it many more times.
Such a majestic creature. I have mad respect for wolfs.
I can't believe he/she showed the stomach like that
danger floof
i just want to make it clear that this woman is a trained professional and that no one should ever try this in the wild

WOLVES ARE NOT DOGS

Animals too, remember good parents.
I always, always forget how big wolves are.
...still does the "I didn't tell you to stop" look when she stopped petting him for a moment.
Damn! Is she a Stark?
This is how wolfos became doggos
Fun Fact: That woman's cajones are twice as large as mine.
Wolf: I will lead my pack to glory! None shall stand in our way!

Woman: *shows up*

Wolf: ❤MOMMY❤
Everyone wolves are vicious wild animals


Wolves: Gib me belly rubs hooman
He is parallel universe Mowgli
***BIG doggo***
Are all wolves about this size? I always imagined them much smaller
Damn wolves are big!!
Liam Neeson's confused.
I always get surprised when I see a wolf next to an adult human. Goodness in my head they’re the same size as Labradors or something.
There's a wildlife park that takes care of injured animals near my home, and they have a pack of wolves (caged). They mostly ignore people, but if you coo at them and call them over in a baby voice, they're putty in your hands. They'll give you kisses, let you pet them, and roll over for you like this.
Why didn’t i know that wolves were this huge?
^(so basically im very big)
Inside of me there are two wolves. One acknowledges that this is a wild animal, and I can't have one as a pet (both for legal and ethical reasons). The other desperately wants to boop dat snoot!! Very good carnivorous floof. 😍
I never knew wolves were so big. I thought they were average dog sized, but that this is honestly humongous.

That being said, I want to pet it cuz it looks so fluffy.
I think this is probably how our ancestors tamed wolves and how dogs came about. Maybe anything could be tamed in such a way if only we understood how to best handle their development. I mean, dogs can be viscous, they can and have killed using their teeth and claws, but we trust them as a part of the family. 

Who knows, in a few thousand years maybe we'll have the descendants of other wild animals as our pets. Maybe little dog sized bears. It makes you wonder.
#We all liked that
You don’t realize how big wolfs are until you see them next to humans
I always forget how big wolves are
No credit given to original post. Choppy/grainy video. This has been posted so many times I can't even tell which one is the human or the wolf in the video anymore.
Wolf: no i’m a wild carnivore.

Woman: hehe belly rubs go brrrrrr.
Teach me the way
Wow...huge one 😍
A few moments later. Grrr.
He is huge. What big paws you have
Look at the size of that boy!
On my phone when I first saw this I thought it was behind the scenes footage of Game of Thrones.
Holy shit wolves are HUGE!
Jesus he's a giant! Is he the alpha or something?
He is like just for you mom. I have a repo on the street.
Amazing how much I thought they looked like dogs right up until seeing this wolf in typical "dog" context.
"Come on Dan, pull yourself together man.  You're a wolf, act like it" - other wolves probably
omg so cute! xD
You forget just how massive wolves are. Impressive beast.
God sometimes I forget that wolves are massive.
I just realized how big wolves are, it's impressive
This one is as cute as he is big
this makes me want to read GOT again
Is loving belly rubs a canine thing?
Wow, he submitted to her!! Amazing
I always forget how massive wolves are.
I hate having dogs lick my mouth, but I guess if a fucking wolf wants to lick my face and mouth, you let the wolf like your face and mouth
It’s incredible how big actual wolves are.
I always forget how massive wolves are
Is that wolf absolutely huge or is that woman tiny?
Dude I had no idea how huge grey wolves are.
Holy moly thats adorable. My heart is mElTiNg
Holy shit that thing is huge bruh
Wolf are fucking big.
Have met this wolf actually and he is a massive cuddler. I highly recommend going to the Colorado Wolf and Wildlife Sanctuary if you are ever near the area. They are outside of Colorado Springs and very informative on the preservation of this wonderful animal. You can also donate online!
Does she let the wolf lick inside her mouth?
I love how whenever she stopped scratching he turned round to kinda say "yo whatcha doing?! don't stop, please continue the scritches". Super cute!
I never realized how big wolves are
When people say a Kangal is a "wolf killer" I doubt that a Kangal can hold its ground against a grey wolf this size
Man, how large is the average wolf? I've always thought they were about the size of a husky (since they look alike), but lol turns they're fucking *huge*
The North remembers
I always forget how _big_ are these heckin beasts
Jezus is she just tiny or are wolves just absolutely massive?
Nymeria!
Holy crap I had no idea wolves were so massive
Cool video :), that is incredible.  I was wondering, is the average grey wolf this size? Or is it like a sort of minority of them that reach this size perhaps? thanks.
For a wolf to show its belly like that is a sign of absolute trust! Very cool
The size of wolves always surprise me. In my head they're just kinda bigger than a coyote but in real life they're massive. 

I'm mostly a cat person and the most beautiful animal on earth to me is the mountain lion but wolves are definitely up there in the top 5 for me.
I always forget how big wolfs actually are.
Legosi looks different here...
WOW! I didnt realise a wolf was so large! 
.. or is it just an unusually small woman?
Sometimes I forget how big wolves actually are
Wow I didn’t know wolves were that big
Wtf is that how big those good boys are? Hard no deal from me. No deal.
Well wolves are a lot bigger than I expected
Sansa stark?🤨
No matter how many times I see this pair, I can't believe how massive he is.  His paw is the size of my face.
Big ass wolf
He is beautiful and graceful! It must be a cool experience to raise a wild animal and have them remember you in the wild. Sweet
Restored faith in humanity : 100%
Belly rubs!!!
Goddamn. It will never stop blowing me away how absolutely massive wolves are.
Actually he is always and always has been a good boy.
 but they are also loyal and smart and self-possessed. They're quite a headache to raise but you grow to love them.
His paw is the size of her face. Big doggo.
Anyone else not realize how big wolves actually are?
You can see the wolf smiling
Are sure that's not a Direwolf?
Whenever I see these videos or pictures I realize how odd it must be to see my DnD character with her giant wolf.
Its just amazing how wolfs are almost just like dogs
That is amazing - and that animal is huuuuuuuge son
Holy shit I didn't know wolves were so big
He’s a little floofer
I never realized how big wolfs really are
I think I’ve seen this on reddit in various threads every few days but I really don’t mind
I did not realize quite how big these puppers are
That's a large puppy.
Yeah I couldn’t fight a wolf. That’s a lot bigger than I thought
Didn’t think a wolf would let a person run their belly even if they raised them.
I always thought that movie the grey was sensationalized. Now I'm like holy fuck I'm staying away from any place that has wolves. They are beautiful, massive and deadly
Wolf raised by fox
Now I understand how wolves can take out people who are stranded in the woods and all that bushwack.
What do you mean "becomes a good boy"? He's already the best boy there is
Who else didn’t know wolfs were that big
White fang, is that you ??
“Becomes a good boi”

He is always a good boi, maybe he becomes a gentle boi.
“Whose a good boy?” So cute! I would love to be a mom to a wolf in the wild!
He acts just like my husky. Even putting the leg on top of her shoulder as she scratches him.
The magic of belly rubs
Damn, I always forget just how huge grey wolves are...   
Still a very good boi\^\^
I’ve always known that wolves are big but like..  god damn..  it always surprises me just how big they are!
I miss my wolf. My dad gave her away before she was an adult... wonder how big she got
Wolves are so huge compared to dogs. But no matter what species, belly rubs are universal.
I am so used to seeing dogs that I keep forgetting how big wolves are 🐺
And then he ate her.
I swear this gets reposted every week
He is sooo handsomeee
Wow!! He's massive....or is she tiny?
Protip, dogs love a butt scratch. That area above the tail will make even the most annoyed dog your fren
So - and I get that we wouldn't fully understand it - what is the likely "role" of this woman in their "pack?"  


I use the quotes because it might not be like that at all, they might understand she's an outsider...  


Would he/the pack be likely to help defend her at all should she come under attack by a predator they might stand up to any other day?  


Zoological know-nothing here. Be gentle.
The size of the thing !
Fucking huge
One pet I wish I could have is a wolf or any other big wild cat but I’d want to be a multi millionaire so I can buy a ton of acres and let them live on it
Can I take him home with me?!?
What ahuuuuunit!
Jesus that is a BIG wolf.
Fuck that wolf is huge!!!!!!
Fuck me that thing could crush her skull in his mouth
Holy shit he is massive
Its so enormous that it almost look like a cgi
So big!
Holy crap! Look at his size! 😮
Best thing I’ve seen today thank you

I think that’s the Colorado woman, there are two wolf ladies I’ve read about in the past. [Think this one is Kekoa.](https://www.thedodo.com/gray-wolf-kekoa-gives-kisses-1605702674.html)
That bitch could go chomp chomp and she’s gone
Man this twilight deleted scene sucks
Don’t try this at home. Lol

I’m pretty sure that woman took every darn precaution so we didn’t just have a video of the flesh being ripped off her face.
my dog does exactly that paw thing, where she will put it on your shoulder when you pet her belly. why do they do that?
Good doggo
Aww he's bashful in front of the camera.

How many people are going to watch this and then try and cuddle with a wolf?
That is a big ass wolf.
My question is, is he THAT big, or is she THAT small???
Oh my Lord that thing is huge

I didn't know wolves were that big, damm

I love this.
So Twilight was actually accurate in depicting wolves?
I can see the line from that wolf to my big goofy pit bull all the sudden.
wow i never really saw how big wolves are. Most other photos don’t include any humans for scale...or if they do, it’s a big man.
Jesus, that's one big boi
Either she is real small or that is a massive wolf
It's just a big dog, I would definitely like to have one :D
its funny how wolves/dogs and cats signals are so often so different. As a cat owner the backwards ears and all looked like he was about to snap at her.
GIMME!!!!!!!
It's always surprising just how massive grey wolves are. I can't wrap my mind around the change from that to a Pug. We really fucked up.
The rarest of puppers
I always forget just how big wolves are.
It always gets me just how huge wolves are compared to even big dogs.
I forgot how big wolves are compared to humans sometimes
Aww cmon man, I'm crying now. Fuck you OP. :-)

By the way the wolf is a *she*. I'm from the countryside in Eastern Europe so I have some knowledge.
This is just what I needed to see today, just fantastic!!!
Always forget how fucking big wolfs are.
Either she's a toddler, or Wolves are wayyyy bigger than I realized.

WOW 😍😍😍
I tend to forget how absolutely massive these things are.
I don't know how tall she is but that boy is HUGE.
Wolves are huge!
You forget how big wolves really are
Arya and Nymeria reunited.
I saw a black wolf that from a distance looked as big as a huge cow crossing the road in the Adirondacks back in December. Could’ve been a yeti too for all I know. Thing was friggin huge and all my years driving the Adirondacks I’ve never seen one like that.

it kills me how big they are, you think they're just like a 60lbs dog, but they're so much bigger
He's HUUUGGGEEE!!!!
Pro tip. Wolf's brawl for fun. If you're lucky to encounter a submissive wolf, smile big, but don't show your teeth if you can help it.

If you raised her, well, you're probably okay to smile since she's used to it.
100% trusts her, showed her his belly
fukin huge
One of my moms old co-workers had a wolf as a pet and I used to love going over to her house and playing with it. He acted like any other dog except he was about 2-3 times the size of a normal dog.
what steps can i take to be just like her 
i want to help animals in need
That's a heckin good boyo
Probably been a long time since he got scritches
Wolf is like "this is nice, we should do this for 30 thousand years"
Seeing the trust for each other I'd love to know the backstory.

Why did I not know that wolves were this large?!
This wolf video is way better than the one they showed on your moms house
Ok, is she short or is he big? Because I legit didn’t realise that wolves were this large. I knew they could be tall but I always thought their strength was from being pack animals. If a group of Greys like this charged you’d be screwed.
That's a big, good wolf!
The way he pushes his front paw against her during the belly rubs is exactly identical to what my dog does 

Always confuses me because she kinda makes it hard for me to pet her with her pushing me away and all but it's still cute
I’m just amazed at the size of the wolf. In books and docos it’s hard to get an idea for their real life scale. This is mind blowing.
I don't think I realized how big a wolf is before.
Wait THAT'S wolf? I thought they were the size of dogs? That's huge! I am truly shocked.
The look on his face at the beginning is like, ‘I could eat you, but I’m not supposed to :(. Fine... belly rubs instead!’
Oh bullshit. That's as a wolf rescue. You can see the fences. Pack my ass.

Thanks for putting a smile on my face!

Yeah, play, but with great care, takes one gesture mistaken for threat and it's game over.
Is that a really big wolf, a small woman, or are wolves just a heck of a lot bigger than I imagined??
Unlike that video where a wolf French kisses a woman.
Absolutely gorgeous animal. I’ve had run ins with Wolves twice. Both times were deep in the woods in Michigan’s UP. 

In neither of those run ins did I feel unsafe. Scared? Yep! 

Both times, the wolf checked me out from a distance, realized I wasn’t a threat, and went about it’s day.

Their intelligence is an incredible thing to witness.
If I ever see a wolf, I will pet him. Even if I die. You can’t change my mind.
Today I learned just how big a wolf is
I want one as a pet but it’ll prolly screw the environment over or hurt the wolf mentally or something so I can’t do it with out being a piece of shit
In mother russia, wolf is pet.
Beautiful 🔥
With lions and tigers it is kind of obvious, but wolves are very huge. I always underestimate it

Wolves are wonderful, better than

I know this video is older, this just reinforces how I feel about the wildlife ban being lifted in Alaska. Our wolves are under attack. They're being hunted from airplanes not because they're actually cause any problems but because they look good stuffed in somebody's office or store. It breaks my heart.
There’s a wolf reservation a few towns over from me. They let you get in the closure with the wolves and teach you about them and what not. Its really cool
Just by the way this woman reacted to the wolf when he rolled over and kept her rubbing hand in plain site in the air for several seconds before she rubbed solely the chest in a confined and controlled motion shows that she has spent a shit ton of time with them and knows exactly what she is doing.
How many people fucking raise wolf packs

That’s kinda dangerous because the wolf can still turn on her

Is she a small lady or do wolves grow that big?

This is amazing thanks for sharing
The satisfaction she must feel !
Holy shit wolves are huge. That is terrifying and awe-inspiring all at once.

It makes sense, it's why I love wolves, family/pack play a huge part in their lives, and that's why I love them, as someone who didn't get a great family.
Hmm, yes. Repost
Nope
Every dog is a good boy on the inside, no matter you big
This wolf's head is about the same size as my dog.

A great example of how aggression/bad behavior in pets is learned through poor treatment from humans.

Ohh u such a lovable boii 😍😍
I’m pretty sure an animals belly is one of the most vulnerable places so the fact that the wolf let her touch it shows an amazing level of trust 😊
Look at the size of him!
Dammm that's a BIG BOY
Having a wolf expose it's belly to you with love is a badge of honour few humans ever get to have.

Why do almost all dogs (big and little) do that thing where when they roll over and you go to pet their stomach, they’ll lift one paw in the air and basically push you with it, in this video the wolf put it on the lady’s shoulder but sometimes my dog will slap me in the face while I’m trying to pet them
He's one of the goodest boys I've seen in a while.
Awwwwww. l love it! The wolf was acting like a dog. Sooooo cute! That wolf must really love that woman. l would love to know how that woman raised that wolf. He looks like a big husky

I watched a video about this wolf and lady on a channel called Extreme Trends, I really recommend watching it, I can’t find the link but I hope you can find it!
Would love to do that have done Canada geese they were fun let them join a wild flock was able to get to know the whole flock was an awesome experience for 5 years
If wolves didn't have it in them to be friendly with humans in the first place we would have never been able to create dogs.

Hey its the same video that gets posted 1 time a week for the last 20474238428904672894620426402863480246802364 years.
That’s a big woof
Ah yes, belly rubs, the internationally understood language of all doggos
Wow wolves are a lot bigger than i imagine. Freakin awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I want a fucking direwolf like this
Wolves are cute.
Such a unit of an animal - this is a ballsy lady.  Clearly he's a goofball but I imagine that was an immense amount of time and effort getting to that level of trust.
Wow, they are huge!
Wtf its so big
Never to big for mommas love
i wonder if they (wolves in this case but i generally mean dogs) stand with their butts near our face like that because they think we also like to sniff butts.
This is my dream
Holy shit, wolves are that big?
That thing is huge
I am always surprised by how big these things are.
Very large puppy
wolves are so badass and cool i love them
that's a husky from an anime like Naruto
Don't try this at home kids.
Isn’t this bad though? Like I heard that the wolves become attached to the humans and learn to be soft around them, and then they’re not tough enough or not able to help themselves in the wild.
Dang! How big is that critter!???
When wolves aren't hungry they're just huge doggos.  I wish I had a wolf for a pet.
