That slight pause was adorable.
My pup does this but sometimes he does it in an annoyed way cause I keep kissing him until he does it back so he just side eyes me and nibbles my nose and then licks it really impatiently and then he goes back to napping .
I love how you can see her think it through. Super adorable when she arrived at the “kiss back” conclusion.
Pup's like "what just happened? Did I just get kissed?! Gotta kiss back!"
I love how the pupper kinda looks around and then at the camera like “uhh.. do I do it back or?”
Well that one got me right in the feels!
Is this an Aussie?!? My mini Aussie looks exactly like this! Her colorings are almost identical!
That was sooooooooo fuckin’ cute!
My favorite video of the day so far!
That side glance before kissing you back killed me! Super cute pup!
He protect

He attac

But most importantly, he kiss bacc

Edit: apparently she
“Ohhhh I get it, instead of licks she shows affections by smashing her mouth into my face. Got it.”
the dog's "processing" face is too much omg
Oh so dogs with superior bone structure get kisses from females but here I am, a single, raging misogynistic narcissist and vapid boor and NOTHING!?
My heart can't take it! That was the sweetest reaction!
I absolutely love how wholesome this is.
You kiss me? I kiss you bork!
I’m 100% a cat person but you cannot fuck with a dogs love. They are so wonderful. 😍
He looked at the camera like wait minute ...
Where is my free award when I need it
Doggo was like "Uno reverse card!"
What a gorgeous little pup!
I think he feels the same...
Am I the only one who had to watch it on repeat several times to increase the awwww factor 😀
What a gentle little kiss!
I can’t stop watching
I think you're dating now.
RIP your inbox
"Is this how you do it? Am I a good boy?"
He looks around like what is this silly human...fine whatever. And then he does it back to make her happy. Because that’s what dogs do.
That was awesome.
this remind me of my first kiss
I kissed a dog and I liked it
Thank you for this! Reading r/politics had me all sad but this made me happy!
Boop
Awe he is a good boy.  Such a cutie.   God bless
is that a mini aussie?
I kissed my goose and he is angry me now
I wish my best friend would do that to me
Holy shit, I thought you were [Daisy](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bones/images/5/51/Daisy_Wick.png/revision/latest?cb=20161106104417) from the show Bones for a good couple seconds, there.
wow, he learned how to kiss, and you learned how to "wuff"
Our dog eats his poo sometimes. No way am I letting his mouth anywhere near my face
Aawww!
What type of dog is this?
♪ I kissed a dog and I liked it, the taste of her crunchy kibble ♫

Unbelievably C-U-T-E
Awwwwwwww
This is the single cutest thing I have ever seen on this sub. Thanks for brightening my night.
My Berner does this too!!
If I did that to my berner at that age he would have bitten me lol.
What breed is this pup?! :)
He puckers up! Adorable!
He wants more!
❤️
Ahaha this is precious
That rust color means this sweet pup might be a Bernese Mountain Dog / Aussie mix. They have that same exact coloring in the same pattern. The eyebrows look like that and it’s the best.
Thats awesome! Love it
Awww 😍
😭😭😭
The slight pause was so adorable
My depression was immediately reversed
We literally rescued an Aussie about 4 hours ago. Greatest thing we’ve done in awhile. Amazing breed.
this is what makes people love doggies.
The dog was like what just happened
Love it !! Pups are the best
Bow chiki bow wow
’Friend’
I thought this was funny, but it turns out it's fuckin' precious.
What you doin step doge
This dog knows what’s up!
Super cute, but just so you know that was your dog telling you not to do that. They did not like that at all, and you're actually weakening your bond with them.  Both the reaction immediately after and the muzzle punch was a big fuck off. 

Source:wife works in the pet industry, we both have raised dogs our entire lives and have done extensive training and worked with some of the top trainers in the country.

edit: This is not meant to be directed at the op specifically, but I love the fact that just about everyone posting legitimate information about dog behaviour is getting down voted into oblivion. Yes, some people are being asses about it, which is silly, because it's understandable that there's just a lot that the average dog owner isn't going to understand about their dog, but it's a real shame that instead of trying to better understand dog behaviour and deepen their relationships with their dogs, they choose to humanize their behaviour and jam their fingers in their ears yelling I CAN'T HEAR YOU BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COINCIDE WITH THE TRUTH I WANT TO BELIEVE!


edit #2: Some reading for those interested.

The last link is particularly interesting, especially the signs of stress picture at the bottom. Obviously it's eyes and turning it's head away were the major ones, but there are two other possible signs of stress shown in the video too, although it's hard to say with such a short clip.

Totally scripted
What kind of dog is that
get a room !
Your dog must love their owner very much!
Adorable!
Aww so cute 😭
guess he's not in the friend-zone anymore.
my kokorooooo~ 💖
Lol I love that reaction is the same when everyone’s had a cuteness overload
I have a mutt that loves giving kisses so we play the kissing game. He likes to be in my bubble to i try kiss him on the snoot before he can kiss me. It’s super fun and everyone wins.
I wish my dog loved me that much :/
Adorable
Hey it's me, your best friend!
I am screaming. It is so cute!
Oh my god, what a beautiful dog! I love the little pause and the glance to the camera, my poor heart. I hope one day I can have a little doggo friend
D'awwwww
The eye contact at the end. Such a sweet thing.
Dogs = great
That’s adorable.
Bernese and Aussie mix?
Dawwww
I made the exact same face when I watched this!
doggie
That’s how me and my dog greet each other!

I kiss her cheek then she bumps her nose into me.
I can't stop watching this so cute
That was so cute!  :)
Look at the camera like, "seriously? in front of everyone?"
The look on the dogs face is adorable.
Geez, what a hell of a haircut...
Aww
I did this and my cat bite my nose
Too cute!!
Doggo gets more kisses than I get. 

But I can't hate on the doggo because many cutes.
I love this so much. Too pure.
This is by far the cutest thing I saw today.
So sweet!! 😍❤
If I tried this with my best friend they'd say "What the hell man, I'm not into that!" and run away screaming. At least that's what I think would happen.
My heart just melted ♥ ...
I think people forget dogs lick their junk still cute tho
That video won the Internet ❤️
Awwwwww! So cute!
"I only like her as a friend, but she feeds me...so I better kiss her back"
Your pup looks almost identical to my girl [darcy](http://imgur.com/gallery/F1Uc6LN)
I think my dog is the grown up version of your dog lol. What breed is your little pup?
ohhh fuck! I just fell in love!!!
Hey im super bad with dog breeds what breed is this (besides super best good boy/good girl)

This video just absolutely made my night

If you look into it, her name is Hailey Osbon. She is a well know pup trafficker. This is one of her many victims. RIP.
Looks a lot like my boys. Aussie mix?
You dont have to play your choice
Those are quite possibly the cutest ears
*Gentle Schmooch*
Ok
Cute
This is just the sweetest thing. ❤️ Needed this tonight! Thank you, you two adorable sweeties!
THIS is what I'm here for!  More of this, stat! Please.
/u/vredditshare
“Nose boops” are dog language- called “distancing decreasing behavior” 
That’s them saying “I like you come closer!” (Usually, nothing happens in a vacuum with dog behavior so be careful)
That’s a kiss!
What is the breed of your adorable dog?
Awe, hopefully it lasts and the biting of teething is only a momentary stumble 🥰
You kissed a dog and he liked it
Ralph
Cute.....
Yo this Girls cute tho
That’s adorable! Brought a smile to my face.
The brief pause when he looks at the camera 🤣
Does he have room for another best friend 🥺
I’ve got the same breed puppy and they do this all the time it’s so weird
Aww pupper snooted your boop!
I have become melt... the liquid of man
In Soviet Rrrrusia dog kiss you!!!
My dog and I do something similar. I give him a kiss while he does his little growls because chihuahua and he gives me a kiss. Then rinse and repeat lol
my dog bites my nose
I love how he doesn’t really know why she just booped his face with her mouth, but he copies her anyway because his human must like that and dogs are pure.
Omg I wasn't sure what I was expecting but that surpassed it.
dog kinda reminds me of someone who was called an impostor in among us

Edit: to clarify, brown says red is sus. Red thinks,  then right back brown is sus.
My boy just backs his head tf up lmaooo
🐕 after getting 😘 - "how dare ya", sees camera. "Cannot leave evidence, may be next time, take 😘 now"
You know what, normally when animals imitate us, the timing's off and it's a bit awkward, but that was spot. fucking. on.
We dont deserve dogs
r/aww
The dog looked confused for a second lol
I did the same to my puppy and he literally bit me on the lips. I had to get stitches...
when i kiss my dog he turns to me and ends up licking my face, usually he aims for my lips
What breed is this dog?
Can the dog be my best friend too?
😍
ooo baby
That's the first time you've kissed your best friend?
Nooooo, this is way too precious!
Is that a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog? Because j have on and he looks just like your sdorable puppers!
Awe! My springer spaniel does the Same!
Aww, your human is cute. What's her name?

Also, congrats on developing the ability to convey human speech through text. You're a smart doggie!
A much more wholesome version of kissing your best friend.
Aw how old?
Seeing Barley at the top of my reddit feed very much threw me through a loop. Very adorable tho.
Lovely dog I hope they get treats!
I once kissed my best friend to see what would happen. A half an hour later we were in the middle of the best threesome I've ever had.
The goodest boy 🥺
You both are adorable!
Still wants to be friends
That’s definitely a skit
That was adorable and I don’t like it
Aww! ❤
We don’t deserve dogs 🐶!
That made me smile ♡♡♡
issoright
Insanely sweet...
That's irritability cute. Thanks....I had to reset  my. sacracasm and misinthropy filters.
❤️ I love that so so much!
What beautiful little moment.
Aww
Mine first growls at me then he suddenly kiss me, Idk if that is regret, a passive-aggressive relation, provocation or a new type of bypolarity that can make the two emotion in the same time, but I prefer to think that's is a bro relation, they only want to provoke each other but love themselves.
Ohhhhemmmgeeee, this was adorable. Sweet puppers
You are gorgeous :)
That is TOO sweet!
Hoooolly shit that is adorable!
What comes around goes around
I felt lonely before I watched this. Now... well now... 😭
Dogs KNOW they are cute

They know what theyre doing
Cute! I only kiss my puppy on the top of her head lol
I want a dog like this
Wait, are you saying this is the first time you kissed your dog?
Awwww this is so cute!!! 😍😍😍
AWWWE MY HEART SHANDUSJWJ—

That’s love.
You got put in the man's best friendzone.
[Brother?](https://i.imgur.com/Uv18nyd.jpg)
My pup is half Australian Shepherd and she gives little closed mouth kisses like that too ❤️
That there is an Aussie pup - Black Tri.  I have a Red Tri.  FYI 

Brilliant dogs that deserve a lot of attention and excercise - really smart so plz spent time with him/her!!!

Hooman -- this thing with lips. I don't have lips. But whatev.
His baffled pause and then smooch. So adorable. I watched like 20 times
Hmmm ... much like a 14yr old boy ... 😂
That is adorable!! Your doggo loves you!!
Beautiful
When I tried this on my Doxie he just decided to "bite" my nose.
Staged
I never thought I'd see the day where I actually see a classmate on reddit. Wild. 

So cuteeee!
Gorgeous dog!
Welcome to reddit. You have now peaked.

Breed?
This is why my momma always told me not to kiss them. Lol.
This made my day
What kind of dog is that?
Omg that’s sooooo YOU ARE NOW MANUALLY BREATHING
Replay <3 so cute you two
Adorable ❤️
Dude it’s about to EAT
I will never stop upvoting dogs. NEVER!
What breed of dog?
Im getting an aussie next month! I hope mine is a lovebug💕
My dog licks my nose when I kiss her. She’s the best.
my pup friend zoned my ass
I literally made an audible 'awwww' sound when I saw this. Your best friend is the cutest thing ever!💕
What are you doing with my dog?
Does your friend have a brother?
I tried to do that once. Little shit tried to eat my lips.
I just see a smelly dog, wheres that friend?
What breed?
Wholesome
Yeah I think we're going to need some more pictures and videos of your best friend (please and thank you!)
Aww that’s so sweet!!
So cute!!
I’ve seen it all. Goodnight.

Aussies are the best
Now this is watch worthy.

I can't take all this sweetness :D
The Best lol
YOU JUST KNOW
Adorable
Lmao my cat does this
OMG THIS IS ADORABLE
This is so cute, what makes it even cuter is that you are also very cute.
My cat does this and it's adorable
I can’t wait to get an Aussie. They are so precious!
What kind of dog is that?

My friend is taking it pretty hard"

Muh heart!!!! ❤
He was like “wtf? Ok I guess kiss back”
Your dog is wonderful and so is your username. Great flick. :)
👩‍🦳🐕
Adorable little guy
Awww 🥰
I kissed my best friend and got a restraining order from her
I've spent so much time on Tiktok I expected "Lightning in a Bottle" to be playing.
I have an Australian Shepherd as well. They’re so cute even when they grow bigger
Omg I can’t even with this.... ಥ_ಥ
Man I really needed this. Thanks!
He kissed you back! what a lovely dog!
You took a risk and it panned out !
You look so much like my ex its scary! Your name Kirsty?!?
Dogpill strikes again
r/mademesmile
BARLEY DOG!!!!!!!!!!
This is the only version of the trend I will accept.
She looks a little like a young Sally Field . . . well to me anyway!
You got a snoot boop, you have been accepted
♫I gave her my best kiss♫

♫She gave it back again♫

--Tom Petty
the sound of her heart melting (and when ours did too)
Awwwww...
Awwww
What breed is that
Wow!  That is one very happy pup.  Thanks for sharing.
Unexpected kisses are the best!
My dog used to get really jealous when I kissed my ex gf so I started giving her kisses. Now she demands them everytime I see here in a new room and I love it lmao.
Niedlich und vollkommen süße Reaktion von der Hündin
The amount of adorable of this, made my day. Dogs are the best. Case and point; my puppers noticed my daughter was putting her "the child/baby yoda" doll in a bassinet for dolls, so when the toy got taken out, the dog grabs her favorite stuffy, and gently places it in the bassinet  and laid down beside it so it could "nap".
He clearly thinks he was attacked and attacked back
Had a shitty day at work. This made my day less shitty. Thanks.
So, so, sweet.  Made me smile.
Why are so many comments censored?
Nice blanket strat. Shifting the focus to the dog.
He looks IDENTICAL TO MY DOGGO
oh golly, the doggie imitates her!! THAT IS SO CUTE

A match made in heaven.
Getting kissed/licked by your dog is cute until you remember they lick their balls/vaggies many times a day  

Ye, you got dog gennies in your face
My Berner gives kisses too!!
This video made my night
That *pause* made my day
ive said it before and i'll say it again.


we dont deserve dogs
The dog is confused because it's a submissive gesture.
Not only just being amazed by how she copied you but she also opened her mouth before she kissed back because you did. Dogs can be so fucking smart and kind
Looks like it's true what they say about white women and dogs
[removed]
Awww so cute.  Now you both of you can poop worms.
And this is how furries are born
Inspect the ground and you may find some trail mix.
If that is your best friend, I think you should find new friends.

Hi there, hope you are well, love this video! Would we be able to use it for Express Newspapers with a credit to you? Kind regards, Ben

My pup pushes his forehead or his cheek against my lips to get his kisses. Sometimes i literally suffocate because he is pushing so hard for so long i start passing out. He also gives the softest, slowest and controlled kisses. His older brother gave too many kisses way to aggressively straight to the mouth so he knows that people dont like mouth kisses but he still wants to give you one or 2 some times and therefore does it in the most controlled fashion ive ever seen a dog take. Its like an honor to get a kiss from my pupper.
[removed]
Fake.
Learn from my experiences: kissing your best friend is all well and good, but then they kiss you back and you start to feel sexually attracted to them and things get complicated...
Ugly dog, cats are better
So cute!
That's how you get pink eye!
I bet she makes out with that dog
Wow only 9k karma for this you would expect more from 150 K UPVOTES!
He loves her 100%. Can see it in his little eyes. Cute.
which breed is this dog?
Wtf is wrong with dog people 🤢🤮🤮
