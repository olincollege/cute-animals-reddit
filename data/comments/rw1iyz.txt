Resting Betty face
My wife would be convinced that Betty would not hate her, leading to actions which would inevitably make Betty hate her more.
Thanks Betty, I hate me too.
Please, *please* tell Betty that I love her.
such adorable hate
Betty’s expression is exactly how I feel today lmao
Hi Betty, welcome to hate anonymous group where we hate everything and not anonymous at all about it.
I’d still try and pet her grumpy ass.
Wow. I could practically hear her screaming at the kids to get off her damn lawn
Grumpy cat : the lost cousin
That’s ok, Betty. I love you anyway ♥️
She looks _offended_ for some reason. 

She's adorable. Give her an extra headpat from me... if you think she'll let you keep your hand.
I love that she hates me.
Understandable. Thank you.
Too bad. I still love her.
OP, I showed this to my wife and she said "I'd still die for her".
That is an AMAZING face
That is such a human expression 😂
Awww, well Betty is so cute!
Wow, just wow... Grumpy kitty is grumpy indeed!
Lol. Betty looks *pissed!* Time for a long nap. XOXO Betty.
I trust Betty's judgment.
Awww, I hate Betty too

Betty is a bitch and I love it.

Perhaps Betty is mourning the passing of animal advocate Betty White…RIP😿
That's how my grandma would stare at me if I dared to touch something in the store lol.
[So intense](https://imgur.com/gWCcXFC)
Ooh she grompy!
Ohhhhh come now, Betty. Don’t be like that.
But I love her!
Anyone else seeing Hugo Weaving?
What the FUCK Betty?!?!?
Why does this cat remind me of my 3rd-grade teacher who threw out my tamagachi?
That cat looks like it was a human in a past life, and pissed off it came back as a cat.

Betty is my spirit animal
Thought she had a little tiara but looks like that's just the background.

&#x200B;

Cute catto
I'm okay with her hating me, because she's so sweet!
My reaction to pretty much everything all the time.
I’ve never wanted to be friends with someone so much.. Betty let me love you
Jokes on you, Betty. I'm going to love you anyway! 🧡
Betty kinda looks like she hates the communal smell of all the internet. But nothing personal though, lol.
I wanna give Betty boops 🥰😄

If bit i on f w you- was a cat
Awww  🥰  I'm in the fb group where Betty's person first posted this.  We love Betty.  😍🥰😍
Nice kitty
I agree. Betty hates everyone
One thing i Don't mind hating me cause of how cute it is
Irritated cat is irritated.
Ironically, her face makes her more loveable.
Ask me if I give a fuck what Betty thinks?
😾
Feeling’s mutual.
Looks like it too
No doubt about it
love you, betty
Thanks Betty, it's hard to like-minded creatures these days
Yeah I can tell
I'd gladly sacrifice my hand to pet Betty!
Looks like Betty knows how to cat.
Never have I thought in my life that I'd relate to a cat
She can join the list
*laughed out loud* 😼
Betty, you will have to get in line please.
Even me?
Betty has good instincts.
Haha this is absolutely great!! She's the one who should've been called Grumpy cat
Its okay id still die for Betty ♥️
Understandable, have a nice day
Five minutes later Betty is curled up on my lap and purring her butt off....
So cute 😍😍😍
I love her though
She would totally swat my hand.
Angry betty so cute ❤️❤️❤️
Omg 😂🤣
That’s my accountant
Are you worshipping her properly?
Justified.
Better get in line, Betty.
Sorry Betty I still love you.
Too bad Betty i love you.
I love her
Hate me all you want imma still love you against your will.
OMG!...I love you Betty! I want to pet you!
Tough luck Betty, ‘cause I love you.
Oh my god she is adorable
Too bad because I love her
Even me??? I just got here!
The look of every doctors receptionist in one cat.
Bitch!
Fuck Betty
Omg.  Haha.
I hate her too
Haha! Perfect name! Totally looks like a Betty.
Oh yeah? Screw you too buddy!!!

  
Not really, I love you Betty <3
Is it "Okay" that I just accept that she hates me; while, still wanting more?
Or, is that unhealthy?
Grumpy cat incarnate
She's entitled to her opinion.
I see her point, I'd hate us too.
She is risen! Our new grumpy cat messiah!
Found my spirit animal.  hi,  Betty
a most serious case of resting cat face
I hate me too
10/10 would give Betty a hug and immediately regret it
My name is John and I hate every single one of you.
Yeah well I love her enough for the both of us so it's fine
I love her.
I have a Betty too but she's a complete lovey mush.
We’ve all got a slice of Betty on the inside.  When keeping it real goes right.
I have a cat like this (a tortie though) and even though she complains the entire time she gets her pettings and cuddles. And she’s right there every morning meowing for attention 

The fact that it’s breakfast time has nothing to do with that, she totally loves me.
Not to be dramatic but I would die for this cat
🤣🤣
I don’t care. I love her.
Hahahahaa
And we hate her too!
H- have
A- all
T- the 
E- endearments

If anyone asks anything, the answer from Betty is, of course..https://imgur.com/EfRoofw.jpg
How can something so small be so angry?
I love Betty even if she hates me
I love her.
I relate with Betty.
I love her even more now. Thanks for the hatred!
This looks like the first cat that's said "FUCK" out loud.
https://imgur.com/8cEWXGy.jpg

Your cat makes a great meme format
"I am NOT cute!" - this cutie
I love her!
Petty Betty

I would love her hate 🥰🥰
Thank you Betty for making me feel included
Grumpy Betty: the sequel to Ugly Betty.
Look at that face.
Ahhh, my upvote was the one to get to 100k. I have achieved pure satisfaction.
Thank you Betty. That is what procrastinating me deserved.
That makes the feeling mutual.
Wanna share with my cat to see how she acts...
My Poppy almost looks like your Betty except a couple white spots on her coat and tail...Poppy is almost always annoyed as well..unless you have food or treats and such.
BUT I LOVE HERRR!
"The names Betty, you son of a pig...."
But I loves her ❤️
If Greta Thunberg were a cat. 😸😸😸
Tell Betty that the Internet loves and worships her nonetheless.
Can you tell Betty I love her ❤️
From now on Betty is my favorite living being on this planet.
It would of been great if this cats name was Karen 🤣
She looks like she'll yell at you for skateboarding
I don't care if Betty hates me, I love her anyway.
#BREAKING NEWS

#*ADORABLE KITTY HATES ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE*
Named the stray feral cat Betty White in her honor. I have been feeding her going on three months. She was just a streak at first running to petting with hissing and this past Sunday she had coffee with us on the porch. Hopefully, can get her to where I can pick her up so she can go to the vet. Neighbors are pissed that I am feeding her.
Epic kitty 10/10
i hate us too, betty.
And, we are honored.
Betty can hate me all she wants.
Found my spirit animal.
I don’t think that’s a look of hate. Just a resting hate face.

I’m willing to be proven wrong, even if it involves scratched up arms.
Yup. This is a 100k upvote post.
She can hate me all she wants, I love her
Finally.  A cat post I can support
I get this cat, I understand lol

Hi Betty! My kitty wants you to know that every single morning she MUST remind me to feed her. Living with humans is a tough life.

I thought she was just displeased with us.
Haha 😆 That look of utter disgust! Sorry, Betty, but I love you anyway.
I agree with Betty. Everything is bullshit.

Not sure what to say about this other than that I genuinely laughed out loud.
Jeez Betty.  I'm trying!

She looks like a 1950s schoolteacher who’s fueled only by a mixture of caffeine and hatred

For good reason
Relatable
Dear Betty, I have accepted your hatred with humility. Please continue to hate with all your heart.
That is one hell of a resting bitch face
I'll take it 🤷🏻‍♂️
This cat wants to speak to your manager.
Fuck you Betty. Don't judge me.
I have found my spirit animal.
Going to explode from how badly I want to squeeze and boop this cute little angry face
Thats OK. I still love you, Betty
Too bad cause I’d die for Betty
One of my Grandmothers had a white Persian that hated everyone.
I will gladly accept the burden of this hatred
Looks like she caught the Pope mid-fart
I'm sorry for whatever I did, Betty!
Yeah well I love her so too bad.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have discovered grumpy cat II
That face is amazing. Just the right amount of contempt, disgust and hatred.
Equal hatred for all.

Betty does not discriminate.
Can't argue with cat logic...
But isn't Betty... A woman's name? Obligatory Kung Pow
It'd be hard to not wanna mess with her all day.
Should nickname her Betty Spite ❤️
Betty Gray and White
Just don’t call a cat Betty!!! I had a devil cat called Betty and she was the actual devil
Call it like you see it Betty.
Love a [r/standardissuecat](https://www.reddit.com/r/standardissuecat/) with some good RBF. 😂
If Betty says so, I probably deserve it.
Betty you look like my spirit animal lol
Not me. I am beneath her contempt.
I hate her too
Same Betty.
I think She hates this Universe.
Seldom do you see something so angry yet adorable at the same time
Aww man, understandable :(
Good. Tell Betty I won’t give here any this tuna I have open and am munching on.
 Well, I adore Betty even if she hates my guts.. lol
I normally don’t like cat posts…or any posts really but this one needed mine. I love you Betty
Who cares? Lol
Awww we love betty!
I have a cat that looks just like her.. Zoey. Zoey is a hater of all. She occasionally gives love on her terms only.
She looks shocked and disgusted that we would even be in her presence
My name is Betty Hall, and I hate you one and all, and I hate you one and all! Damn your eyes!!
I like Betty.
I don't care if Betty hates me, I think she's wonderful.
Betty would like to speak to your manager.
Thanks Betty. I hate you too. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval)
Aww, little Betty Spite.

I can change her
I love Betty...unrequited love...
Well, I love you Betty, more than a thousand and one stars in the sky!
I have a hateful lady, too.  She swipes at me every time.  She also bites.
I wonder if Angry Cat can carry on Grumpy Cat's legacy.
Motion to dub this "Somebody farted cat" and make her internet famous.
sweet kitty.  I've never met a cat who didn't like me and yours would probably like me too.

I have plenty kitty treats.
And yet I love her all the same.
Fuck you cat
I found my spirit animal.
There was grumpy cat, now meet angry cat.
I have never wanted to be more hated by a cat in all my life.
It’s okay Betty. I hate redditors too:)
But we still wuv her
D:
As well she should.
I could win Betty over. I just know it.
We’ve found the anti-Jorts!
Betty wants a Boop!
She could be the number one hater at the player haters ball. Hate hate hate hate hate
Upvoted simply for title
I have been pretty depressed lately, and this picture made me laugh with joy for the first time in awhile. Thank you :)
Well, I love her.
Wow, please give us more of Betty, she is perfect!

Please tell Betty I love her
Thx for hating me Betty ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|laughing)
Well fuck you too Betty
Is Betty really angry or she just looks it?
I would take a bullet for your cat. She reminds me so much of my Akina. They could be murderous sisters.
I lov betty
I love Betty even if she hates me
Is that really anger, or just industrial sized judgement/disappointment.   You sir, are doing it wrong!
Same 👌✨
Betty is my spirit animal
Betty, you are my sunshine and I will snuggles and love you and accept your disapproval.
Betty, I feel you.
I love her face.
“Betty had never seen such bullshit before”
Whoa Black Betty Bam A Lam
Me: Awww Betty, what's the matter?

Betty: Your face. I hate it.
I would die for Betty, and she would love that
But we love her anyway
I would die for Betty. She would simply stare and do an angry huff at my corpse before eating my soft, warm innards but I'm fine with that.
Love you BEEETTTTYYYYY!
That grumpy little face is disapprovingly adorable.
Well heck to you betty
I have Temptations.
*sigh* I deserve it
Is her last name White?
Love you, Betty! ♥️🐾
Damn, Betty. Was just saying "hi"....

Despite all my rage, I'm still just a cat in a cage!
That face!

I'll bet if i fall asleep on the couch she'll stealth cuddle me even though she hates me, I'm a pillow person.
Love you Betts 😊
Awww! She reminds me of a dear friend of mine.🥰

I've never smiled at hatred so much before 😍
Well too bad cause I love her to bits
Betty reminds me of Bull Shannon from Night Court.
Ron Swanson as a cat
tell betty i’ll kick her fucking teeth in
Respect, Betty, I'm pretty hateable.
I think she needs a boop
Tell her we all love her. She’ll hate us more.
Reminds me of my ex-wf, with more happiness
I hate Betty too ❤️
"If you'll just let me explain Betty!"
Well I love her
She does have that face.
She looks more like a Karen.
Take my award, you miserable mitten.
Understandable
Betty Fight
The perfect face for telling you not to do something.

"I think I'll eat one more piece of pie..." 

"I'll just hit that snooze alarm button..."
Betty does appear to be in a mood.
Looks pissed...
Lol
I had a semi feral cat named Betty. She also hated everyone … but me … eventually.
Is friend shaped. Will pet
I’ll fight her.
I would cuddle all of the rage out of her and then go to the hospital.
If "YOU KIDS GET OFF MY LAWN!" was a face.☺☺
I understand Betty, I hate me too. That doesn’t mean I can’t still love you though! ❤️
The perfect face
Betty should be aware that she doesn't hurt my feelings because she hates humans.  And that's because this human is a dog lover and not a cat lover.  The last cat I encounter was sitting on our outdoor cushions, urinating on them as though it was her personally kitty tray so we capture it and took it to the animal shelter where hopefully she is adopted by a cat lover, and not euthanized.
At least she feels strongly about me!
Grumpy Cat 2.0 Even Grumpier
Ermahgerd?
#BETTY ANGY 😾
Hate you too, Betty.  Just kidding!
I love Betty, also she looks like Grumpy Cat’s cousin!
Well fuck you too cat
fuck you too, Betty
Either that or she's about to sneeze.  Or both!
As it should be
Listen Betty, no one hates me as much as I hate me. Get back in your lane
Why does she hate me? I haven’t done anything to piss her off yet.
My mother's name is Betty. Sounds about Right.
Not me!
HIII BETTY, I LOVE YOUUUUU
It’s okay, we all love Betty
This is the new grumpy cat
[My name is Betty.](https://imgur.com/gallery/s9O8D7G)
Yep, I can feel the Fresh Hell radiating from the glossy orbs of fire!
I love her
That cat watches the news every day and criticizes EVERYONE
Betty needs some catnip
.
aww I hate her too!
So cute!
That is fair I get that from a lot of people
She doesn't even know me!
That's the energy
Should be the image for stank face!
I can make her love me.
Nice
Where are the people of r/art and why haven’t they water colored Betty yet?
Somebody please photoshop a Karen haircut over this cat.
It’s fine if she hates me I adore her.
That's great. I hate her, too.
The cat means well.
angy
Aww she can hate me if she wants to.. I will still love her.
Me after finding out there are only 8 episodes to this season of the witcher
Betty, your face is going to get stuck like that.
Grumpy cat 2.0
I love her and she will like it!!!
Me, with a laser pointer at hand:

![gif](giphy|IfyjWLQMeF6kbG2r0z|downsized)
She looks like she is surprised at how much she hates everyone
Thank you. Just finished watching the human centipede 2 and I needed to see this.
That expression... She wants to talk to the manager, *right meow!*
Betty is righteously outraged at how long this shit has been going on.

  So much so, that outrage has clouded her memory of what she was so outraged about.  

That's a clawin'.
Yes she does, that little cutie pie!
I'm sorry, I love her.
I love Grumpy Betty!
Fuck you too Betty. You cute fluff ball who I would certainly give a singular head pat to
She looks like Samuel Jackson
Good
Well I love betty
"I strongly disapprove"

"Of what?"

"Everything"
Fuck you Betty
I love Betty.
Betty Spite
You sure she's not Karen?
It’s “Caren” with a C
Evil Betty -Kung Pow! Enter the Fist
Betty Spite
Betty does not take any shit from anyone, it appears.
Im allergic to cats so I just ignore them.

I've never met a cat that didn't like me.
Forget Betty..
fuck you too, Betty
Betty Black. She hates everyone.
Thanks Betty! I hate you too, you’re cute but you seem like an asshole.
Well yeah, she has the worst resting bitch face I’ve seen since grumpy cat. 😂
I love betty ♥
She has a very [important message for you all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz1rjq5emKY)
I'm used to it. All cats hate me until they know I'm allergic. Then I'm their best friend.
I have never seen a cat that looked so pissed off in my entire life.
Wow.
This is the best thing I've seen all day. Plus I'm glad I know where I stand with Betty.
Would still try to pet Betty. Hisses, scratches allergies idgaf.
Grumpy Cat 2
Grumpy Cat's lil sis 🤣
I hate all people too
With the general state of humanity lately, I totally get it, Betty.
Awwww I’m not even mad she hates my guts 🥰
This is how the world looks at me when I farted...
I hate her too. Fuck off
Betty looks awesome.
the mother-in-law cat!
I don't doubt her.
 I can feel it.
Thats a shame, because I love Betty
[Eek Squeakington feels the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/rw5wd6/eek_is_my_grumpy_overseer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
Betty would extra not like being around my dogs :)
