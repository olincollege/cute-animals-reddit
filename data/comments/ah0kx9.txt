I have a cheap miniature tent. My cats like to take a running dive into it, and slide with it on the floor for a few feet. Hilarious.
May your roads lead you to warm sand.
That cat looking at you is smelling cop. He is about a quarter second away from folding up the blanket and taking off the fuck out of there as fast as he can.
These sands are cold, but Khajiit feels the warmth of your presence.
[deleted]
I‚Äôll take all the skooma! You can flip that stuff to anyone!
I realize this is all about khajit though I do want to share a cat sitting trick. If you are going away and have a cat(s) that are not social or skittish, chances are they will hide from whomever comes to feed them. 

This is not fun as a sitter if they (cats) need medication or I need to know if they are actually eating. 

Make simple cat tents with sheets and chairs, drape a sheet off a desk, a bed etc. They will hide in a tent and your pet sitter can find them and report on their health with so much more ease and accuracy. 

I once spent 45 minutes looking for a cat that needed a small dose of a tuna flavored medication, owner put a tent in each room and ever since not only does it make my life easier but the cats are more likely to eat when they feel hidden so they get (tent) room service

Ahh, salaam and good evening to you, worthy friend. Please, come closer!
MY GOD! I have to go home and tell Hobbes he's internet famous.
Many thanks for the gold, kind stranger!

Edit: Seriously though, thank you guys. I never thought this would blow up like it did and I‚Äôm so happy to see it bringing so many people joy, haha. I have told Hobbes he‚Äôs famous and given him a good snuggle.
That Kajiit better have some skooma. I'm getting fucked up tonight with Paarthurnax and the Gray Beards! 
Something tells me the only thing he values in his collection is the orange mouse, I‚Äôll trade him a pouch of cat nip and a feather toy for everything else.
It‚Äôs Garfield the Deals Warlock!
Hmm M‚Äôaiq is a lot smaller than I remember. Or is he?
My friend, my friend, the mouse is a great mouse.. it was my great grandfather's mouse.. for you, 5 fish.. I would normally let it go for 10 fish, but you are like family to me.. it would be great to keep it in the family eh?.. so 5 fish?  Come, let us discuss over milk.. the mouse, she is yours yes?
How much for the pro controller
Is that an enchanted switch blade? Or just standard?
By the look on his face-his prices are firm. 
How much for the pro controller, cat?
Khajiit has stolen nothing!!!
i dunno why the knife was the funniest part for me, lol. Maybe it's something closer to what a khajiit would actually sell.

Misread title as "Our cat is obsessed with blanket farts". 
That requires *gold* to purchase.

***DO YOU HAVE SOME???***
Whadaya boiyin'? whadaya sellin'?
"Nords are so serious about beards. So many beards. M'aiq thinks they wish they had glorious manes like khajiit."
It looks like he suggests the mouse so I'll take that please.
I HAVE COIN!!! How much for the toy mouse? It's clearly the best thing here.
But will he train me in pickpocketing?
No one will ever read this, but we had the same orange tabby.  Ours was a male that loved enclosed spaces to go when the noise was too much, like company, fireworks, loud exhaust muscle cars ripping up the street.

His favorite?  Our estate came with vintage cut crystal chandeliers.  Not really our thing but looked great to everyone but the younger crowd.  "Why do you live in a museum?"  It cut my wife pretty hard, millennials are ruthless.  She ordered them all removed and stored.  

The smallest one, about 4 feet in diameter and the same in depth, was taken down by crane and instead of disassembly for storage, this one was crated up with a drape over it.  Found out that one side had not been nailed closed but left open.

It was set in the corner of the piano room and forgotten until we had to find the cat one afternoon.  Nowhere to be found until we flicked a can of wet food and he appeared.

He started being out in the open less and less and missing and only the can flick got him to appear, as if out of thin air.

Come to find out, he had dragged a tiny blanket into the crate and was laying under the chandelier, its open side, flooded with diaphanous light from the drape and the window just behind.

It stayed in that corner for another year before he passed from congenital heart disease.  12 years on this planet, ten of them taking a pill every morning without complaint, so that his little kidneys could pump the extra fluid out for a race horse pee later.

We like to think that last year was peaceful for him and beautiful to witness in his private 'room'.  We lay back there so many times with him in those last days, watching the prism light play across his fur, while he purred, with a congested heart and failing kidneys.

You will be missed, forever, little man.  You were such a good boy.
Selling weapons and electronics, typical cat.
I used to have coin but then i took an arrow to the knee.
I swear to god that TV remote looks *exactly* like the one that went missing from my living room a few days ago.

Some may call this junk.. me, I call them treasures...
Does he accept rupees? 
You gave a cat a butterfly knife? Have fun being dead, OP. 
Lol I love when cats have that confused look on their faces.
Does he uh... hold on... (looks around) he got Skooma?

Hello traveller! Welcome to my shop. I have many wares, but pick wisely!
No one wants a steam controller.
I love blanket forts! There was always one at my house, growing up. This cat and i can have some awesome adventures together. 
Khajit has many wares human, if you have the coin

Khajitt has done nothing wrong 
Mine just straight climbs under the sheets with me every night when I'm asleep.
Khajiit did nothing wrong!
May your roads lead you to warm sands...
I have an orange tabby who loves them too, she curls up in this big blanket I leave in a heap on the couch for her and just her head pokes out üò∏
Damn khajiit always think they can rip me off, until they spawn in dawnstar and i just steal all their crap. 
I used to play this with my cousins. We gathered random items from the house and then made a shop, and our parents and grandparents came to "buy" stuff.
Good times :')
May your travels take you to warm sands...
LOOK OUT HE HAS A MULTITOOL!
i just want to examine your wares cat i will not harm you
Do treats work as well!? Hahaha so cute!!
how much for the phone? 10,000 coin

how much for the toy mouse? 1,000,000 coin
Beautiful Skyrim reference
My Orange cat also adores anything that you can go inside of. I guess it's the same "if I fits, I sits" mentality that many cats have. 
I see you have a pro controller. Why not give me a hand on dark souls on switch 
Touch the switch controller, you get the switch blade
How much is the controller
That cat is straped. The blades not for sale, it's for use.
I like the switchblade on the end, like "Khajjt has steel for thieves"
WHAT ARE YA BUYIN?
Be quick traveler, for my wares do not last long in this land of blanket and litter
Does he take bitecoin?
Whaddaya buyin'?
Whaddya buyin?  Whaddya sellin? 
fancy a game of gwent for your wares? 
Is your cat Jewish? 
What kind of controller is that?  Is it a Windows one or is both XBox and Windows?  It looks sturdy and comfortable to hold.
Our girl loves tents. Especially if your legs are the poles. Cute but not the best when you want to go sleep and she's nosing at the duvet to get under!
Beautiful cat.
OP, wanna play smash?
He looks very polite.


The fucking controller I want now
I just started up a new character last night and the only khajiit i‚Äôve ran into so far is M‚Äôaiq the Liar and I swear he‚Äôs been following me. I traveled from Helgen, past Whiterun, to Ivarstead, then to Riften, making random stops on the way for side quests and I have seen M‚Äôaiq 7 times in different places.
My cat is too. How did you make this? I‚Äôve never come up with an idea to make a self-standing one with stuff sitting around my house. I usually have to hold it up myself until she gets bored.
Funny thing is in TES lore there is a Species of Khajiit that is basically a house cat in size and appearance. I think it's one of the most intelligent species as well iirc.
What a cutie
Are you me from the future? i literally have all those items and a very similar cat that also loves blanket forts.     
This is seriously eerie
But does he have Skooma?
My cat is the same way except she wants to do this when I go to bed. She will sit patiently next to my head and continue to lick my face with her spiky tongue until I lift the blanket and let her in. If I let the blanket fall she will exit and lick me relentlessly until I do it again. The end result is I have to pitch her a tent and let her sit and purr for about 10 minutes before she is satisfied and leaves me alone.
But does he have skooma?
What are you buyin‚Äô?
it looks like he thinks he is being asked "Okay now, which of these toys is alright for your to chew on?" "Dis one!?" 
"Technocat has hardwares, if you have the bitcoins"
I used to be an adventurer like you... 
I‚Äôm here for your finest bat-mouse 
he looks like this ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢
pls don‚Äôt make him sell his toyüòø
Warm sands my friend. 
I have all of paper and all of coin
Tools, wares, and weapons. All for sale at fair prices.
Guaranteed that the mouse has the highest price.
You're cat has switch blade....
Imagine now you have to buy your phone back each time you wanna use it. 
Khajiits have plenty of wares for hooman
‚ÄúI have many many wares‚Äù lol
But does he have skooma?
khajit stole nothing
Yo Cat! How much for the controller?
Can I be friends with OP? 
My the roads lead you to warm sands traveler
My guess is the mouse is the most expensive priced item 
He looks so polite. 
The things we do for our kids!
" It's dangerous to go alone! Take this!" 
He better give out a good quest. No more of go catch 10 rats and skin them.
The title says Skyrim but the layout of good‚Äôs says Fable
So funny, my cat also loves blanket forts. 
The good stuff is behind the fort. Kitty is pushing catnip by the Cup 
Damn kajits! This ist all stolen!
It's dangerous to go alone, take this.
Didn't I see you like 3 worlds over? Meow you got better items? Where was this when i needed it? Grrrr. I'll take the mouse.
why would it sell its toy?
You should post this on r/theadventurezone 

Garfield the deals warlock! 
My cats love forts. I cant even adjust my blanket without them trying to jump underneath. 
I'm not giving that khajit anything! He's just gonna waste it on skooma!
The mousie is a one of a kind and will cost you extra 
Omfg thats fucking adorable!
He sell skooma?!
Not this mousie tho. That ones mine.
You are over encumbered.
He has fizzy bubbly?
I would not put a switchblade anywhere near my cat because...he would kill me with it.
That's right. Give the cat a knife. 
Good stuff. I require more "cat in blanket fort."
Oh, bruh, he is gesturing to the cat toy. Don't ever buy cat toys from cats, you will *not* get the market rate. They severely inflate the value.
Khajiit has many wares if traveller has the coin.
This is the best thing ever. Reminds me of the merchant from Slay the spire as well.
I immediately had the shop music from the old SNES Zelda game start playing in my head when I saw this.
*Zelda shop music intensifies*
omg OP your cat is amazingly adorable, I'm crying.  May I draw/paint a picture of your cat from this photo?  Not for sale, just for fun and practice.
Aww, look at that little cat face.
IS THAT A SWITCHBLADE?! 
That's the cutest thing I've ever seen! 
"I recommend the toy mouse... can't go wrong there, my friend."
I think he has vague suspicions you're making fun of him. He's so cute!!
Screenshot from the new Elder Scrolls expansion (not kidding)
I thought it said blanket farts.  It took me a while.
His expression says "NOT THE CAT TOY. That's not for sale." 
"Khajit selling overpriced goods" Skyrim, 4E 16, Colored
I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs a bunch of normal items then a cat toy and lastly a fucking knife lmao.
Bring coines
Man that cat is so cool
When I make my bed I always fold down the top part of the comforter neatly, and then my cat gets under there and digs around and fucks the whole thing up. 
I see a Khajit I upvote.
May your road lead you to warm sands, Khajit
So cute!

I do this for my brown tabby boy with pillows.

He likes them closed off and cozy. Once he‚Äôs in, it‚Äôs Bugsy‚Äôs Fort and his territorial instincts kick in. He‚Äôll shoot a paw out at you if you get too close and snort!
Blessings of the moon upon you, traveler.

I just wanna know how did you figure out his thing?
Haha this is to cute. Looks like he owns his own shop. "Come take a look at all my items for sale....except the mouse.....he's mine"

Owner: Take this object, but beware it carries a terrible curse...

Homer: [worried] Ooooh, that's bad.

Owner: But it comes with a free Frogurt!

Homer: [relieved] That's good.

Owner: The Frogurt is also cursed.

Homer: [worried] That's bad.

Owner: But you get your choice of topping!

Homer: [relieved] That's good.

Owner: The toppings contains Potassium Benzoate. [Homer stares, confused] That's bad.

I get the feeling the mouse is the most powerful artifact this merchant has to offer. 
/r/khajiithaswares 
Touch my catnip mouse and I will fucking shank you!
He'll sell everything but the mouse...that's just for show/a warning to robbers.

u/title2imagebot

Tell him I am looking for merchants willing to fence goods for the local Thieves Guild. 
It‚Äôs simple math guardian. 
This is just too cute!!!
Damn, I could really go for some moon sugar right now
your cat is business minded? 
My cat was also a tent enthusiast.
(In Eastern European Cat accent) I have mousie here. Very fine mousie, nicest mousie you ever see. Dipped in water bowl once, maybe twice, almost new.
He looks like a honest trader
He has his own little shelter.
Hello i am Khajiit would you like to buy my wares 
Back scratcha here?
Potion Seller!

r/blanketforts
I wonder if he is offering any skooma. 
‚ÄúPerhaps you‚Äôd like this catnip mouse - used, yes, but gently, and still in quite good shape.  I‚Äôd consider a fair offer.‚Äù
*pick pocket* Stealth 100
But is he called Khajit
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Is he camped outside Whiterun?
Skyrim
I'll take the pro controller 
A picturevof a cute cat shop makes my day 
This makes me think of the vendors in the Plains of Eidolon marketplace in Warframe.
Khajit did not steal anything.
I'm guessing that the mouse toy costs the most coin. 
So is his name Kaajit or Ranjit? 
Trinkets, odds and ends, that sort of thing
He‚Äôs being tested to see if he‚Äôs the avatar. 
He has your wares, if you have catnip.
Got some rare things on sale stranger 
A Pro Controller?

~~Y'all got Smash?~~
Do you by chance play Elder Scrolls? Because there is this wonderful companion mod for Skyrim who happens to be a blue Khajiit named Inigo.
Mai'iq??
I‚Äôll have one vampire mouse please 
Khajit has wears, if you have the coin! 
J‚Äôzargo will be best merchant trader
Does he have any skooma 
I'll have that pro controller and the mouse toy please.
"What are'ye selling?"
Take a look!
May your road lead you to warm sands.
How much does kitty charge for the Nintendo Switch Pro controller?
I'll take that toy mouse. How much?
why does this have the same color scheme as mr. krabs?
Very cute!
I am willing to trade with the Khajit\~
*"Take a look."*
Aww nice that's cute

It‚Äôs dangerous to go alone! Take this. 
"You spend more time on electronics than me!"
What mobile the kitty is using?
M'aiq is interested in the wares.
Got some rare things on sale, stranger!
He's a real Prince of Purrrsia.
I thought 'Street Singer' was his name and was wondering whether he was a famous singer who went unnoticed.
Pssssst, got some moon sugar?
"What are ya buyin'?"
I‚Äôll take the orange bat mouse for 1 oz of catnip. My kitties lost theirs. 
Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger!

This reminds me of the time my kid and her friend made a Kohl's and tried to sell our own stuff to us.

Who gave the cat a knife? Also what kind of knife is that?
"he has wares, if you have coin"
That made me actually laugh out loud
