The hard stop, the heavy breathing, the bug eyes... adorable.
Ah Cariad is that Welsh for love?!
Source:  The Smiling Sheep on twitter (GwenogFlock), about them:

"A country smallholding in mid-Devon. Rare breed sheep and pure natural wool. A tranquil retreat and a celebration of all things home grown."

Edit:  sorry for the error in the title, it should say HER human.  Doh.
I also like the other one who sees Cariad take off and starts jumping along but just stopped and stared lol
OOH LAWD SHE COMIN’
r/petthedamnsheep
Aw, that other ~~goat~~ sheep definitely thought *"Oh right, playtime!"* when they saw Cariad starting to trot.
Cariad! <3 Cymru am byth!
Lol!! He really loves you!
Cariad means sweetheart in Welsh :)
There’s nothing better than having a bottle fed goat come running from across the pasture
^(boing boing) boing boing BOING BOING *HALLOO!!*
Dude goats are so cute
He zoomed so hard and you don't even give him a hug?
“Did you bring the baa-ttle”
ITT: people that dont know the difference between a goat and a sheep.

No hate. Just funny to see people on the Goat Love Train and forget about our friends the Sheeps
Don’t eat Cariad please
What... is it? Is this a goat? a sheep? a cow? I legitimately cant tell...
Mae Cariad yn hynnod o brydferth, diolch am rhannu😁
in the background: her friend tried to join the party. but soon realized it is human exclusive only. lol!
Love the little in-sync hops haha
She wants pets! Give her pets
Pet the damn sheep!
He's like "HEYY! HEYY! (stops) Hey."
Cariad constantly :)
Cariad is Welsh for love. 😊
r/zoomies
Awww
That cow looks weird
The other goat that gave up chasing instantly xD
[deleted]
Lol I fucking love you Cariad.
*boing boing boing*
People can't tell the difference between a goat and a sheep
[Goat vs Sheep](https://globalanimalpartnership.org/about/news/post/how-can-you-tell-the-difference-between-sheep-and-goats/)

I bet a good chunk of Americans can't tell the difference so here is an article describing their differences.
That look of 'where is my bottle bro'
beep beep im a sheep
For fucks sake PET HIM
We should stop eating animals.
Have you talked with her about her destiny?
“Dude where’s my bottle?”
MOM!!!!
Hello Sheep Friend!
“Hey, you guys got any of that milk?”
Awwww
How adorable, she loves her humans fo sure
When my 75lb dog runs at me like that I cringe and wait for impact. I must admit that, as cute as that was—it was damn cute—it was a little nerve-racking.
Me when the Uber eats arrives
Love, love and love.  Dear Cariad.  (She might want another bottle … some things never get old.)
HOP HOP HOP HOP HOP HOP HOP you got any games?
r/PetTheDamnDog
The sheep at the back 😀😀
She's so bouncy! I love it!
Find you someone who is this excited to see you every day. True love at its purest!
One of the goats start going and they're like oh nothing important.
Love how he hits the brakes and is like what up homey.
i was making the dorkiest ooh and aahing face over this and got caught...thanks a lot
Great video...could be a wolf though..
The head nod at the end like, "Sup."

Its scientifically proven that when we nod up, we're acknowledging we know the person. When we nod down, we're being friendly to or acknowledging someone we don't know. IT'S SCIENCE!
I love this so much !!
S H E  T H I C C
Are you Welsh? I LOVE this...
Best bouncing from long distances award goes to...
Hope with all that love she doesn’t end up on the dining table😡
Will you think of its happy soul while you consume it's flesh?
Có tiếng sẽ hay hơn nhiều !
What breed of dog is this ?
beetlejuice is looking good these days. Cuppa represent!!
Aww, I am just a little jealous
I bottle fed my cat from 2 hours old and she won’t even cuddle
its so cute
Omg I love her.
Omg, just adorable!
#OH LAWD HE COMIN
 RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN.... hi.
The hops uwu
The leader of the band, he has so much self esteem!
That’s an odd looking dog... hahah
The heavy breathing after running hard....I felt that. How cute!
*bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce*
He be running like me when I hear someone orders food 😂😂😂
❤️❤️❤️ so much joy! Thanks for sharing
Perfect example of imprinting and it's life long effects, see how the other animals ignore the humans.
I wish I could run that fast
Did you name her the Welsh word for love?
So sweet
Ahh man I was waiting for the BAAAAHHHHH
I almost love this as much as the fat goose sprinting at the car...
I love the other sheep that also got excited for a moment, began to run, and then lost interest.
r/petthedamngoat
The run, and the legs are too much! Love it!
r/petthedamngoat
Anyone else hear the Lone Ranger theme?
Give her a hug, please!
What a majestic little beast
I love the lil white one who is hi-tails it at first
Just past 2 seconds he briefly hits 100% throttle. Looks like the steering pulls to the right under full load. He had to let up just a touch cuz it got squirrelly.
Hi Cariad, nice to meet you
❤❤🐮
I love how one of the brown one was sorta starting along with it but then stopped when it noticed that he just kept going
"You got games on your phone?"
He’s waiting for pets!
I am here now what?
“Got milk?”
Pet the damn goat!
Bounce bounce bounce bouncebouncebounce
Pet the goat!
Where my bottle Bitch
I feel like this video ended too soon
My response would be... “Hello, sweetheart.”
Awwwwwwww
this is what I want in life 💞😭
chubby happy boy
Moooooooooooooooooooooom!
It’s my dream to have my own land and a few pet goats. I fucking LOVE them.
"........hi"
Pet the damn goat
Aw cariad am byth
Runs all that way and no pets?
This is one of the cutest things I've ever seen!
“Hi! Where’s my bottle?”
Hi! Whats new?
r/zoomies
S'up? Where's my bottle?
When your girl says her parents aren't home but you play it cool once you're there.
Nice
I breastfed my kids for a year,and they don't greet me that well!
GIVE ME MILK HOOMAN
“Oh hey I didn’t even see you there...whatcha up to?”
r/petthedamnsheep
She's adorable! That look of love in her eyes...heart-melting!
Round boi
It looks like a minicow
Bar am ewe baaar am ewe, to your sheep, to your fleece be true,  bar am ewe !
/u/vredditshare
It's an absolute travesty she didn't loudly bleat at you at the end of the video
“Hi!”

“What? No scratchies?”
I love the ‘sup nod at the end
That was a cover for their escape. Look at the one in the top right corner. It almost got over the fence.
this is me when I visit mom for holiday cooking
/u/vredditshare
Best thing I’ve seen all day.
That is a funny looking dog.
Omg! That must bring a smile to your face every single time.
Now this is real r/aww
This makes me so happy!
I fell in love a little today.
Whenever my dog gets super excited he starts prancing around like like it’s the best lol
Well, pet her already! Lol
Those square PUPILS get me every damn time.
That is love in her eyes.  No apple for your buddy?
Beautiful
Me thinks she kind of likes her human's 💗💗💗
Cariad is such a cariad <3
sounds like her family wrote that!
<3
I need to find someone who’ll run across a field just to see me.
"Lemme catch my breath, then you're gonna be smothered in love"
is she a goat or a sheep?
Cariad my wayward son
The ways her legs splay outwards as she runs ❤️
What’s the tag on her ear for?
Omg this is so cute. Pet the goat.
Well, if that isn't THE MOST cutest thing I ever did see!!! I'm saving this post!!!! :)
Aww!
Pet the damn goat!

Edit: cause autocorrect guessed wrong
What a sweet little goober!
^^^bbb^^bbb^BBB^AAA
/r/hugthedamnsheep
This is why I am vegetarian
PET HER YOU MONSTER
“Where the fuck have you been all day? Can I get some scratches?”
That run is so adorable... :)
HI! HI HI HI HI HI HI HI HI HI! I’m here.
I love how the other goat see's him running and goes like "Oh, you wanna play!? -- Wait, what .. NO! Is he going to fight that human!?".
What a good floof
hff hff hff hff hff hff hff hff hff hff hff.....hai
That’s adorable
She is brilliant! 😻
We are all animals.
Fuck me that's a cute happy run. 

The simple stop and stare is great too.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Same name as half of my username! Are you Welsh?
Omg she is magnificent!
“Huff huff huff huff Huff huff huff huff Huff huff huff huff Huff huff huff huff Huff huff huff huff Huff huff huff huff Huff huff huff huff Huff huff huff huff ......................Yes?”
SOME ONE HUG IT GOD DAMMIT !
That's amazing!!!!! She is so cute
He looks like he’s waiting to be baby talked!
Antifenton
/r/memeconomy should say strong buy.
Aweee😍
Aww she's adorable! Her name suits her!
I wanted to see the goat get scritches.
She remembers the love
Oh My God his little legs
Intensity level **1000**
GOATS ARE SUCH DARLINGS!!!!
Disappointed there was no petting at the end.
Happy doggy
Human? What good news you bring me?
She is so cute!!
Where’s my milk...human?
I love her.
*heart melts*
Hello. I am pleased to see you.
Such a chonk
What a sweetheart.
Does anyone notice the other dude behind her who also starts his run up and then realised.. ‘Oh.. that’s not my fam.. hmm”.. and gave up 😂
Freaking adorable!!!
Way too adorable.
I see love in her eyes.
Y'all got any more of that milk?
Whosagooboy
The same look my dog gives me when he knows it’s dinner time
She’s so beautiful,
Welp, that’s the most adorable thing I’ll see all day.
"I boinged boinged over here at top speed, there better be a carrot or something...
Oh please tell me she likes scratches and snuggles
Omg! That’s adorable!
"HUMAN HUMAN HUMAN HUMAN HUMAN HUMAN HUMAN... Oh hi didn't see you there"
She said | |   / \   | |    / \   | |
Did she just give the "sup?" nod?
That’s a very boingy sheep.
“You see that sprint?! Now give me a treat.”
The other goats must be really confused why this one particular goat decided to take off in a dead sprint towards a random direction for seemingly no reason.
At the end, that look - “So.  Where’s my shit”?
I hate sheep, but I’ll make an exception for her. She’s adorable.
r/petthedamndog
Do goats always run by kicking all legs at the same time?  That bounce is goddman adorable and I've never noticed it before.
>We bottle fed her from 2 hours old

And never stopped clearly, blimey
Yo.....y’all got any more of that milk?
So funny
Part of my brain says "sheep" and the other part is telling me "cow"
Mfw I've ran for the bus and the driver says hes not in service.
If you notice, a friend from the herd goes “Hey, where you off to? Lemme come along” and gives up almost instantly “Oh this girls a wild one...” lol
Food
oh mannnn, what cuteness!!!!!
Give her some goddamn scritches!!!!!!!
Love it! I have watched it over and over and over!
why did the look in her eyes in the end make me cry

stop it
YO!
Well don’t just stand there! Tell me how you’ve been?!
Do they still headbutt you when you are not facing them even if they really love you?
The sheep: ***pant*** ***pant*** I CAME AS FAST AS I COULD!
I hope he doesn’t get eaten :(
Nice black coloring!  I hope you sold the fleece when you sheared her.  I love black fleeces.
I wonder what the others think since they’ve never experienced a bond with a human before, most likely
At least acknowledge or give her a hug! Geez... don’t keep her waitin!! The effort was appreciated!
Oh so sweetie
Cool
Wsup?
There is much love there.
S’cute!
I ran all this way. You are gonna me a treat or I'll be goatin.
Pets! Pets! Where’s my pets!! Lol
"Human human human human human human human human human human human human human

Hallo human!"
Pet her you monster!!!
Yes he wants to know why you have put him out with all these others, after all he is human!!
Thanks OP. My mom loves goats, this will make her day.
The nod at the end.  Whasssup?
I cannot get over how round goats/sheep are. I love it.
What a cutie.
“Did you bring the bottle?!”
Pet her!
Lots of bottles have been had by that one!
She nyoomed
Bouncy Boi...
Wow so majestic in the gallop lol
Pet the damn sheep !
I love how her friend starts to run up with her then looks up and stops and thinks, "Waaait no, there's humans up there."
She came running too fast O_o
Cutie
Dear Human, if Cariad is okay with it, please give her an extra  snooty boop and hug for us reddit folk... thanks❤
Cariad or Caridad?
She really hoofed it!
Boddle Boddle Where’s da Boddle Mama?
One of them tries to follow her at first and is like uhhh thats to far lol
I'm pretty sure that's a Balwen, they're a rare welsh mountain sheep. Sheep can be very affectionate, most of mine are
Please don’t sell her for meat.  It makes this whole awww thing dark.
r/petthedamnsheep
Part sheep, part sheep dog.
Wow she's like a field puppy! 🐕 Such love❤️
Too cute
Is that a shoat or a geep?
True love.  My old doggo was like that when I would come home. Current dog does that for the wife but when I come home it’s more of a nod a bro hug.
so cute...
The sheep who thought about following: "nope, this is her moment..."
Weird ass horse. I love her.
Omg. She is adorable!!
C H O N K
Those adorable stares 😍
Thank you for sharing! She is the cutest!
Goats are so fucking funny!  When I was a kid, I was super into horses and my dad wanted a reason to build a barn, so they got me an old mare and the farmer  threw in 2 baby goats for free! Dancer and Heidi had tons of personality, they did anything for treats, hauled ass when they saw us and hated having their daily routine messed with.  If my dad was late with their dinner, they made so much damn noise until he came outside.  They were also very, very curious and got into everything! Dad had trouble keeping them out of the grain bin!
The other was like, why are you running
Where is my bottle, human.
My cats when I open any can.
He’s so cute!  I want to pet him and take him home.
OMG... those eyes! That heavy breathing! So adorable!
Tina, come get your ham!
All 4 legs hop at the same time. Lmao
L♥️VE HER!
SHE CHONK
I watched that waaay too many times, brb.
Amazing the enthusiasm 😂😂😂
 Her little nod at the end like, “sup”.
PET THE DAMN GRASS DOG!
The one at the start that starts to do it then stops....
The other goat trying to check up on it but cant keep up 😭
That needs cartoon sound effects: Boingoing, boingoing, boingoing!

Then "got any milk? This grass is boring as heck."
Me every time my ex calls me
Wait you said his and then she? Clarify please??
Sheep are so cute, ugh my heart (∩´﹏`∩)
*slides* good evening.
Come gimme a hug bruh! (⁎⚈᷀᷁ᴗ⚈᷀᷁⁎)
“So...where’s my hug?”
This is now my favorite video on the Internet.
The prong is strong with this one
I could watch goats and sheep run all day. Sooo good!
Another one in the background makes to follow her but stops once it sees where she’s going.
adorable indeed.
Snack!
Aww, cariad Mawr for cariad!
❤️❤️❤️
Isn’t anyone going to mention the one to our right that starts running with and then stops like, “Oh they’re your human.” 😔
Unlike [Kevin](https://youtu.be/yuwprXAaSv0).
My Nana had a bovine friend named Murdock. Same story, she bottle fed him from his birth. He was her dedicated friend for 12 years.
You owe her some money? She ran up like she came to collect the $50 she let you borrow last week.
So awesome :)
Wow !! she's so adorable! !! I need one of these! 🐏
*gallop gallop gallop gallop gallop gallop gallop* *huff* “Sup?”
Give her the pets!!!!!
The markings on her throat made it looks like her tongue was going crazy as she ran over. lol
Got food?
At first I thought it was a really strange cow lmao.
Put the damn camera down and pet her!!!
\-%\^$&\^4%\^$\^$%\^$&\^$\^%$\^%$\^%$\^%$&\^-

"sup?"
Boink boink boink tap tap tap 👁👄👁
Got milk?
Gotechonk
“Hey uh.....where’s the bottle, mate?”
Pet her now, god damn it!
Dude moves like a fuckin thunderclap that's for sure.
*heavy breathing*

“I came as fast as I could”
This is the look my dog gives me when he wants treats.
These are the only kids I’d want
Cariad: you fooken wat mate?
May we all be loved the way Cariad loves her humans :V
Mhhh lamb chops
Omg she's so cute
I hope they aren't planning to slaughter her for food.  She thinks she is family,  not livestock.
I love one of them trying to chase after her
r/grassdoggos
Funny!
The cutest thing I’ve seen all day!!!
*heavy breathing* : "Human. You're here."
Bad Ass!!!!
"GOT SNACKS?"
This is precious♡♡♡
Hug her!
“You got more milk?”
Aww, I didn’t know that they sheep could run so fast! Super sweet.
Pet the damn goat!
I was worried she wasn't stopping!
I live in Ireland and raised 3 lambs with my two sisters! My little sheep Shauna still came running to me whenever I'd visit her when she went back into the heard as a fully grown sheep 🐑
:)
OMG - my heart has melted and exploded all over the place. Oh to be loved like that...!
Boing boing boing!
Give her some lovey scritches.
Give her a freaking hug!
Fun fact: Goats have rectangular eyes, and yes it freaked me out when I saw them for the first time a few weeks ago.
Growing up, I had 2 pygmie goats in our back yard that were like this
I thought he was gonna say "IT'S....."

*monty python flying circus theme plays*
Wait, is that a cow or a goat? Serious question.
All animals are gorgeous.
Is this a farm or a rescue?
Greatest of all time!
cariad is welsh for love !!!
I see a goat saying, "yo, where the fuck is that bottle? I haven't had any of that in years!"

(The goat is waiting for the human to do something (feed him), and not nuzzling or greeting the human. The goat associates those people with food, not friendship)
My favorite humans
That goat can really move
I was real tired when I first saw this and thought it was a cow
Hi, goat!
This made my day so much better
Cariad is the word for “love” in welsh :)
her face says, where da milk???
is it a goat? a long-legged pig? small cow?
no.
it is a **sheep**
*ohmygodyesyesawesomeYES*............... Hi.
Hello, Cariad .. nice to meet you!  <3

She's nackered, bless her! Animals are amazing ☺️
Dinner has arrived.
Cariad - meaning Darling or sweetheart 💕

Awww those socks!
She thinks she is human.  Animals are so adorable.
That's a chonky goatcow
She will always remember..thats pretty great✌
I love how it seems like the goat clearly had nothing in mind as far as what to do when they got to the human. But they knew they wanted to be near them so SPRINT over there lol. So cute
Well, shes there, u gotta giv her somethin!
Pet me!
Give her pets!!
Mans bestest friend
Field doggo
Welsh for love
That’s good to hear😘
Chonky boy
Is Cariad a Welsh sheep.
Glad she will not be for the dining table.❤️
Goats are awesome creatures, and make great pets
Love the Welsh name!! 💕
Will this goat be sold for meat?
Aww
That's a dog right?
I thought this was that derpy baby goat grown up for a second... i know i'm not alone.
Just give her a hug man
So cute. The head nod is perfect!
Sweetheart
I want to hug her so much!
Put the camera down and give her some lovin'
Baaaàhmom
And she went on to have a full and happy life, before dying of old age?
You ever like, ENJOY giving an upvote?
Omg if anyone or animal came running to me like this I would cry
So very very sweet!
"Good evening"
This is fantastic! And it shows that every animal has feelings!
Goats are funny animals.  When I was 12, we moved from the burbs to the an old farm in the country.  Not long after the move, we drove to the beach in North Carolina for a family vacation. Returning home around midnight the following week, we pulled up to find that one of my Dad's buddys had staked two goats in the front yard.  My Mom was belly laughing and my Dad was in disarray from exhaustion and trying to figure out what to do.  
Those goats lived free-range on the farm for almost eight years.  They were super friendly, completely goofy and made us laugh on a daily basis.  I'm 50 now and my goat impression is still pretty damn good.
Lovely name :) love in welsh
*heavy breathing* sup?
Fuck it can move alright! Mach speed right of the get go.
look at how he run tho
[deleted]
I love this ~~goat~~ sheep!💚💚💚

(I also love the ~~goat~~ sheep that got caught up with the running, but then got confused as to why they were running towards the humans.)
Man that goat is going to feel REALLY betrayed on slaughter day.
So sorry to be the one asking this question but... will Cariad be human food one day or only provide wool?
And people like it on dinner table.
Goats show love by running flat chat across a field just to give you the crazy eye
aww.. when is she set to be slaughtered?
So cute. Definitely the GOAT 💫
Sheep are not meant to run. Such a funny gait!
i thought it was a chicken initially when it was a distance away
And now she is a spicy curry dish. Awwww
"It's Britney bitch"
Nice cat
Blblbl
I was expecting her to suddenly let out a scream directed by Satan himself.
and here I was thinking the sheep wrote this
Super cute until you realise that the goat is on the edge of the herd, not accepted and lonely. Living with no living mum or dad, and thinking that the foster parents are dead.

A ray of sunshine in this goats life is seeing the foster parents alive. Bounding with joy across the pasture, only to be greeted with mute silence. 5 minutes later the foster parents leaves and the cycle continues.
She doesn't look pleased to see you. She looks like a crack addict.
I t ' s . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
IT’S
what fucking wierdo
When is the slaughter?
Very adorable. May his life be filled with happiness until the day he dies of old age...wait....that's not what happens?!?! ..... MOM!!!!
Milk! ... Now!!
Pet the damn goat!
Well of course he has human writes
His human...She's pleased to see us
Please don’t eat animals.

Just me passing through the timeline to give some love to Cariad’s friend that stopped running and let Cariad ran all the way to you.
Looks like you’re going to eat it some day
cant decide if this is r/aww material or r/creepy
It's snoop
There is a Carlos Mencia joke here somewhere
Pet that goat!!!!
Well let the damm goat!!
HIS human?
Watch how several goats turned to see what the heck was going on
Goats are derpy sheep.
*What you say to me?*
Why is the human not petting her?
It’s been along time since I attempted… But does that mean “friend”?
Mountain climbing goats are amazing ❤️
[The goat version of It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOimvn5Msjo)
Whenever I watch one of these, I'm tempted to never eat meat again.
Black Phillip! Black Phillip!
*Goat finally reaches OP*

“IT’S...”
Ah yes, ‘His’ human writes: This is Cariad. We bottle fed ‘Her’ from 2 hours old.
Australian Sheppard?
If  goats could fly.
The is the cutest goat I’ve ever seen but that’s not hard to beat most of them are assholes
Sweet little baby! Y’all are Cariad’s parents!!
I want to pet her, let me pet her.
Goat of mine! Dear sweet goat!
u/catnipbabies
It’s...
Oh lawd he coming
She’s beautiful!
Cariad... that sounds very similar to the word “friend” in Scottish Gaelic. Caraid. Might there be a correlation between the two?
r/petthedamndog well... goat
more video please.   does she like to be petted?
Nice
Omg this is the purest thing I’ve ever seen. His little feet can’t carry him fast enough! But ...Why didn’t this video end with a pet ?! How could you resist those loving googly eyes ?! The baby needs a cuddle 😫
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen on reddit ever
i always thought the first thing was never to name your goat =(
What a cutie.
you run like a goat
I guess they won't be rating that one..
I love her devotion-what a sweetheart ❤️
Dwi’n caru, Cariad!
No matter how gangsta you are in real life, if you see a cow, running towards you like that, you would poop your balls out fosho !
Bounding bounding bounding

"Wazzup"
She is the definition of speed
He’s like wasssssuuuuup
Wow!
Will she live a full life? I hope so.
Soooo cute too
r/bettereveryloop
Cool name
Say something do something she’s waiting 😆
Oh man, I miss living on a Farm.
That one that followed for a few steps behind then was like "nope, wtf are you running for, humans?!!"
She's very cute and looks rambunctious lol
That’s adorable
Black is beautiful, the sheep is adorable
Aw sheeep
Her sweet! She love the people!
Do you keep them for milk and make cheese?
That oval with legs really loves you!
"It's!"
Thing sound like a person dubbed over the breathing. Wierd shit
This is the fattest goat I've ever seen.
Thanks for specifying on who wrote this. Wasn’t entirely sure if it was the goat or not.
My kids aren’t even that happy to see me. Need new kids.
She’s adorable. Love the head nod
my fat ass when the dominos guy knocks on my door
Awwwwwww...she’s adorable!!
Omg, I love her and she loves you!
Aww  Thats so sweet.
Ok literally the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
Adorable....Take good care of her
That’s a “you got some milk hoooman?!” sprint.
lil kids be like: “heeey...you got some games on your phone? can I play?” 👁👁
SHES SO CUTE AND SWEET
Cow
cariad is Welsh for 'love' 💙
Hooooooooooooomaaaaaaaaaan! =]
Get in there and HUG HER!
Have sheep.... always run like that? Have I really never noticed?
Ngariad
Someone should register the slightest facial changes for these animals when they're happy. We must communicate with them! It is possible since they are clearly showing signs of intelligence and abilities to express emotions.
💕
Aww I bottle fed a sheep for a  friend and two years later I went to say goodbye bc she was being sold across the country - I just yelled her name and “bottle” and she ran just like this — it’s the best isn’t it??? 

Thanks for the happy memory!!
So. Freaking. ADORABLE.
This makes my heart smile
Why not
What a nice cow.
Good Evening
Where have you been?! How many times do I have to tell you to stay with the herd? I thought you'd been eaten!
"Aaaaaaye, you um... you um.., you bring dat shit?..."
He picked her up before she did anything
is Cariad a sheep?
"It's".... Monty Python theme music
Quick fact to those that don't know, Cariad means love in Welsh :) so she's showing the love every day! 😘
This warms my heart. Badly needed given the horror plague and destruction/rioting we have to deal with.
Baa baa black sheep
She’s dressed up like a cow!
Looks a bit derpy
Omg I love her!!
sup
I...did not know goats were that fast.
I wish I had someone that would be that excited to see me!

"Well Buman are you here to give me love and treats or not?"
The only way this could get any cuter is if you add some nice warm tortillas and chopped onions
rofl.  We were going on a drive to a holiday house and had to stop at the parents place to feed some orphaned lambs.   We had our cat in the car who cautiously stepped out of the car to see exactly what this video shows. 2 lambs charging at full speed say ~~hey~~ hay!

I didn't know cat's could permanently install themselves under a car seat until this day. Maxi-grip x10000

At the end of the clip I was expecting to hear "It's..." followed by the theme song from Monty Python's Flying Circus.
I’m guessing the reason that the animal is the only one to run up to the person is because that’s the only one that has been hand reared. Not saying that’s bad, it was definitely right to hand rear it, but it’s now tame because of that.
Cute. Whats her ear tag for?

Until that day.......
awwww you named her my love <3
[Now I want more.](https://youtu.be/JA6vZhg1TJk?t=14)
Monitor that critter's diet and allow more exercise run time. Bulging belly and the short run putting it out of breath can lead to problems when it gets older
I think I should stop eating meat again...
Meanwhile she changed her gender....
Aw look at that Welshmens wife, I’m a sucker for a good love story
Bruh
I Heard Pennies.
Aw! Boing boing boing boing-HI!
>His human

>her

>She's

Am I the only one confused by that
SOO CUTE! ❤️
Got milk?
Still trying to figure out if it’s a boy or a girl judging by the title
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom.... ‘sup?
I have never in my life seen a sheep go that fast
How that little sheep behind her tried to imitate her but gave up and just watched.. so cute.
I thought that was a cow, was shocked for a minute there.
Redditors really out here misgendering sheep
Omg hug her already <3
Wonderful 😀
A sheep called Cariad, that has to be the most welsh thing ever.
Love how the other goat was about to follow but then decided naaaaaah I’ll let them see their hooman alone
Don’t ever get sheep shite on your shoes. Seriously, it’s very oily and impossible to remove.
gorgeous
That’s an adorable name! “Cariad” translates to “My love” in welsh so a very fitting name by the looks of things
Whose human?
Thanks for posting this so sweet
Cool dog
The goat changed genders twice in the title and now I’m confused what to call it
This makes me want goats more. She's beautiful
Forest puppy
That ‘sup nod
never seen a goat's "sup'" before.
Couldnt nail the gender down in the title though.
TIL that sheep can change gender mid-sentence
>His human

Jeezus! Give that goat a hug

How people can think this is a goat is beyond me. Yes this glaringly obvious sheep looking thing is a goat. JC.
Chonky goat

What kind of dog is this?
Oh lawd she comin
Sex change mid sentence.
Spare coochie?
Wtf
I did not know cows could show emotions.  ❤️
Y
Fast food!
So innocent and naive... Imagine how easy it'd be to slaughter her.
