#HE MAKE AN BIG STEPPY
The munchkin cat should not exist and it is harmful to propagate them and to fawn over how 'cute' they are.

Their dwarfism has been intentionally bred in to them for our own enjoyment, at direct cost to the health and quality of life of the animal, it's really a disgusting human habit.

Holy shit just realised that's LuLu
I never find these short legged abomination anything close to being cute like most other people do. To me, they look like they were born with congenital defect or something. Why do people insist on breeding them like this?
