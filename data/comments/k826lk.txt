"Stack Cats" is a palindrome.
We bare.. kitties?
Middle cat is not vibing
the middle one looks more squished than the bottom one lmao. this is adorable
I am pretty sure the middle cat is saying " Fuck you. This isn't fucking fun. Can I fucking go now.
Fuck this. ".
They remind me of an ice cream cone with three different flavours. Cute.
what kind of cats are typically this passive? i've never had a cat that would let you stack them but i want one
There’s a [book about this](https://youtu.be/mvazDnLkYzM).

I want some stackable cats too. Where can you get them?
This is so aesthetically pleasing. I love how the cats are similar except for the colors, and not only do they have different coat colors they also have three different eye colors !

Cutest thing I have seen in months.
Is it possible that no one is giving the source? It is from Instagram @amy_simba. There is plenty more photos with 4 cats, one new.

I, too, enjoyed We Bare Bears.

looks like 1 cat in 3 different colors. fantastic!
These stacked cats look very familiar to the cats in warrior cats named jay feather holly leaf and lion blaze TwT

Adorable. They are so chill. I never met a Cat that would allow themselves to be stacked.
I’ll take 8
The middle one isn’t sure about this

Reminds me of Tsum Tsum.
Reminds me of my cheerleading days...when I’d always be at the bottom of the pyramid 😪
Curious if cats like these are bought or rescued. If bought, where do you even buy them?
Kitty totem pole

How did you manage to get them all to cooperate... so nicely, might I add?!?

Amazing where can I get some
That cat comes in a lot of beautiful colorways.
Whats this breed?
Aww
Wow this is an old gif.  Still relevant.
My immediate response when I saw this clip:

>OOOOOOHHHHHH STACKABLE KITTIES.

Yes, I need help.
Now introducing IKEA stackable cats. They are cute and cuddly and everyone* wants them.

*does not include my next door neighbour who regularly complains about being allergic to cats.
Those eyeliners. Wow. I can never reach that perfection!
The top one appears to be falling asleep. That could make the situation even stickier.
Aww, the middle one stole my heart!

The top one seems a lot more ok with this than the middle one.
I can’t stop looking at them, too cute 😍
TOO CUTE
Most adorable.
Middle car gets more squished as top cat gets sleepy
The top seems to fall asleep at the end, the middle is not amused and the last is just going with it 😂
Hella we bare bears vibes
The cat centipede...
Sorry not sorry
I can tell you the middle one is loving it. They love being squished.
Whatever breed this is Ive always called them Delta Burke cats.
The middle one is like :3
What kind of cats are these? The rounder heads & big eyes .... so cute but im guessing you dont find them at a rescue
We bare cats
So adorable.

The cats eyes get progressively more closed the further up you go.

Anyone know the breed?

The cat in the middle tho 😂
Those are good looking pussys. What breed are these? That middle one.
They are so adorable! Are they siblings? They look alike but just in different colors!
What was this filmed with? It’s incredibly clear. 

Also, adorable.
my caca did the cha cha
Middle one is not having it
It's cool and all, but it low lowkey looks like aninal porn....
OP paying the cats tax.
Different skin colours as well as different eye colours. Amazing
..... how?
Where can I get this edition of Jenga?
Half the space, triple the aww
Where do I buy them?
u/savevideo
Two out of three cats recommended it.
**LionBlaze, HollyLeaf, & JayFeather.**

Ok, for real, this is adorable as heck
The middle one is having a good time
Can't wait to see the roomba edition.
The middle ones like “ da fuck I get stuck in the middle”.
If you’re going to steal a Tiktok for karma & crop out the logo, you could at least credit the original.

If anyone is wondering, it’s @amy_simba and [here is the link](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSsPGGSv/)
I'm sorry but this is just some great CGI. I challenge any of us with 3+ cats to get them to do this. It breaks the laws of the universe.
They all have different eye colors and fur and they're so prettyyyy
This is so cute. I love your kitty crew.
Is this the real life, is this just fantasy?

Who knew stacking cats would be easier than stacking storage containers!?

When was this update?
Looks like training for the depression cat from Big Mouth on Netflix.  Needs  more practice as the bottom one looks too content and awake.

Did you stack them or did they stack themselves?

This is a really good idea
The dark gray cat is up to something.
The bottom one looks like they are losing for a Renaissance painting, the middle one is resigned to their fate and the top one philosophizing.
I must save this. How do I save this
I swear, this sub continues to make my day
That’s the cutest totem ever
u/Savevideo
The bottom guy is just going “you done yet with your stupid video, they’re getting heavy...”.
I don't know anything about cats... Except those are really good looking cats.
I want the bottom cat, he’s so cute.
this is a much better variant to the "what position in the human centipede would you want to be in" question
“i just found them like this hahaha”

There’s a book my kids love called Stack The Cats

Definitely looks staged. The only one that looks happy is the one on top. The one on the bottom looks like it's waiting for a treat, and the one in the middle just looks miserable
Do you think they always stack in that order?

That top cat is looooovin it

I love how top kitty just does sleepy eyes and naps, bottom kitty looks resigned but ok--but middle kitty looks ready to tear some fur out.
How are those cats so calm? My cats used to be so hyperactive.
I think this is the best picture I’ve ever seen! They are adorably amazing!

Jungest Child: its so fluffy I’m gonna sleep 

Middle Child: srsly. We are gonna do that again hate everyone

The one in the middle is the true winner of this game.
