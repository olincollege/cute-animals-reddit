"Stack Cats" is a palindrome.
We bare.. kitties?
Middle cat is not vibing
the middle one looks more squished than the bottom one lmao. this is adorable
I am pretty sure the middle cat is saying " Fuck you. This isn't fucking fun. Can I fucking go now.
Fuck this. ".
They remind me of an ice cream cone with three different flavours. Cute.
what kind of cats are typically this passive? i've never had a cat that would let you stack them but i want one
There‚Äôs a [book about this](https://youtu.be/mvazDnLkYzM).

I want some stackable cats too. Where can you get them?
This is so aesthetically pleasing. I love how the cats are similar except for the colors, and not only do they have different coat colors they also have three different eye colors !

Cutest thing I have seen in months.
Is it possible that no one is giving the source? It is from Instagram @amy_simba. There is plenty more photos with 4 cats, one new.

These stacked cats look very familiar to the cats in warrior cats named jay feather holly leaf and lion blaze TwT

Wow this is an old gif.  Still relevant.
My immediate response when I saw this clip:

>OOOOOOHHHHHH STACKABLE KITTIES.

Yes, I need help.
Now introducing IKEA stackable cats. They are cute and cuddly and everyone* wants them.

*does not include my next door neighbour who regularly complains about being allergic to cats.
Those eyeliners. Wow. I can never reach that perfection!
The top one appears to be falling asleep. That could make the situation even stickier.
Aww, the middle one stole my heart!

I'm sorry but this is just some great CGI. I challenge any of us with 3+ cats to get them to do this. It breaks the laws of the universe.
They all have different eye colors and fur and they're so prettyyyy
