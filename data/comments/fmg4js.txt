He seems ok
My older brother once gave our other brother a t-shirt saying “world’s okayest brother” on it. He wears it regularly.
if it sits like that, it's top tier in my eyes
Looks like “World’s chillest cat” to me!
Aww worlds okayest pet, she looks like the worlds fluffiest pet too me!!
The nice thing about low standards is that they're always reachable.
Worlds best pet right there
Cats have no delusions..
I've seen this 4 times already but it never gets old
Quick, friendly PSA: Even in this time of having to stay home all day, remember to not over feed or over treat your pets. Cats, especially, can suffer alot of issues from being over weight and it can shorten their lives. Thank you for loving your pets :3
Chonk
So cute, so modest
What is up with that butt flap? It looks like it has a built-in hemorrhoid pillow.
If you love your pet please please please put it on a diet and get it to a healthy weight.
Why is that flooring so popular in apartments?

This queen looks perfectly content just vibin here... somebody come bring her the most okayest throne
I sits here now
World's coolest cat.
Nah that cat’s pretty cool.
She’s too cute to be ok.
That's Knox. He has an Instagram at meow_york_kitties
My cat is okayer than yours :P
Way to have a 'bottle is over quarter full' attitude! Keep it up Kitty
really, really, really okay.
He seems pretty okayest
Very adequate...
This cat used to be pitch black
Ah the fat man with a beer pose. My cat does it too.
Pretty average. ;-)
he sit.
Oh good mediocrity.
I’m in love with this kitty.  Thank you for posting.  Any joy or smiles are very welcome.  Bless you and be safe. xxxxx
I thought the joke was that it says “okayest” so kitty dodged that mess because it knows it’s the best.
Repost
She’s perfect the way she is
That is a very fat cat
Worlds chillest pet*
I want to snuggle this kitty😻
Why he sit like that ? ?
Haha. Animal obesity funny.
This cat gets me
Okay means wonderful in another language.  Right?
She’s her own beanbag chair
He’s just okay? Are you sure?
*captain, its a repost*
Omg I've seen like 2 other cats in my life that do this. Why do they do this? Lol
Cat trying to reenact that scene from Titanic
I'm whelmed.
Is that a cat or a pokemon?
Now I know who’s been hoarding all the cat food. How long has this kitty been in isolation!?
Not pictured: The heating register just to the left
Even its position under the sign is not perfect, it's okay.
Why do people feed their cats that much? It's obviously overweight and miserable
Surely to God Amazon sells a fucking kitty recliner,  let's go man!
What do you mean okay? Look at the way it’s sat! It’s automatically god tier!
FYI sitting like that is a sign of a health problem. See a vet.
He looks kinda chonky
[deleted]
Why does he sit like a fat martial artist
And....she is doing the squingy Pretty eyes thing too. She's so happy😸
Well I can't read, please tell me I wasn't the only one that read that as worlds gayest pet
this cat seems to be 70% liquid
This cat is my cat's kindred spirit.
The way he sits just makes it work.
*loads LMG with At&t* "just ok is not ok"
r/Chonkers
That’s not exactly centre.
He’s okay with that.
So okay, he won't even sit directly under the arrows.
No hes beautiful
Your cat sits like a derp
Okayest...why such a mediocre rating? Does kitty know of this mediocrity!? Does kitty approve? No! I say no! The sign must be changed to read this proclamation: "Here lies the whitest, fluffiest, bendiest, bestest cat ever conceived in nature ever.  The end."
Okay
Bestest kitty
Looks American
Garfield is that you?
Go sit in the corner of "eh"!
Think I'll stay awhile....
Kinda wanna crop my face onto that cat, ngl
oo
oo
I just love when her eyes go half closed, like "Yep. I'm chilling right here for the day".
This cat is Tubbs irl
Tight! *long distance pets*
it thinks it's people!
Would that make it a mediokitty?
Couldn't even sit in the right place
She is not “okayest” she is greatest ( or he, no discrimination)
Sup? Chillin.
Eh. It's..ok
Im guessing by the floor design that this is in NYC?
What a power move
He's a little off center... I would call that okay. :-)
/u/vredditdownloader
That was ok
Oh lawd he sittin'
World's oldest repost.
She's incredibly alright
/u/vredditshare
u/vredditdownloader
Wow. My childhood kitty did that all the time, almost exactly like that with slow eye blink too
World's parquet-est floor
The execution of the sit: Okay
The placement of the sit: Okay 
The steadiness of the sit: Okay 
10/10 Very Okay
I feel like he’s proud of that title.
You could also post this on r/chonkers
if i were a cat
Thank you for the laugh!
I'm totally ok with this.
you mean 'best'
Just basking in the okayness :D
I have one of those.
Ok my butt
 /u/gifreversingbot
Nice.
What’s cooler than being cool!!??
Read this a s”worlds okayest playset” and was confused for a good minute. I blame the covid.
I’m best .. Bitches!
Amazing wish I had a cat to quarantine with
I didn’t know I needed this
Ok
R/Chonkers
"Ok" - Rammus

Shed n spread
Now that is what I call a cat. What a fluffy chonker.
Hilarious.
my cat sits like this, i thought she was the only one
Id say stop bullying this cat but not sure if bullying a cat is even possible, they will always have the upper hand


Such a majestic creature, beautiful.
Waiting for the vet that comes here to say the cat has hemorrhoids or something like that
Comment
Is that my man thurston waffles
He just sits there like, "yeah, and what"
I mean it’s okay
Looks literally just like my cat, he even sits like that
r/unexpected
Good
Self awareness
The cat knows that you were insulting it and it refuses to sit in that spot under the sign.
Ah, left me some room to sit too, thanks kitty!
Clever!!!
Okay...
Okay.
Funny and cute
The fact that he/she doesn’t sit directly under the sign makes this even better since it stresses “Okayest”
WHAT THE FUCK
WTF
ARE WE RECYCLING MEMES AND DIGGING UP ANCIENT GIFS BC THIS IS THE GOTTDAMN END
This is ok
You spelled choonkerish wrong

My chunky boye sits EXACTLY like this pretty much all the time, I thought he was the only one!!
Mood
The pose. The power. The presence.
Chonky boi
Yeah, ok
Not going to lie but he seems ok.
I have a feeling he won’t have trouble sheltering inside. He already has the lazy sit down perrrrrrfectly!
Looks like he’s about to sing  mr. bombastic
What a derpy way to sit.
Nothin' wrong with the Golden Mean.
Any idea why he sits in that spot?
Super-OKAY!
Thank you for this I am okay now
Yes it’s so Orwellian lmfao
So modest. So okay.
r/toolps
Needs more JPEG
Eh, he's ok
Hahaha!
This has meme potential
that's ok
u/Vredditdownloader
never in my life have i felt such hurt, such pain, such agony.
I originally read that sign as “Worlds Gayest Pet”
Fn honey badger
u/vredditshare
I. I have questions I don't want answered. Like did the cat get trained to do that? I like to believe no. It just knows it's the most ok cat and it goes there
😺😺😺😺😺😺😻👍👍👍👍😀😀
This cat is the feline personification of Meh.
He’s more than ok he’s amazing
The utter dismay of this cat when it stares back...
Got a pretty good laugh out of that, thanks \^\_\^
u/vredditdownloader
Ragdoll is the most peaceful breed of cat.
Also the worlds cutest lil chonker
That tail wiggle ♥️
Yes.
Oh, woops, I should center up under the sign

*herm*

You know, right here is fine too
You're telling me that pet is just okay?!?  Look how it sits!
I aspire to be that okay
The fact that he isn't even in the center somehow makes it even better.
World’s Most Adequate Pet?
cute
That’s my spirit animal
The ok ok is pretty ok... but I ok to my cats being the okayist, ok?
Ok
u/Vredditdownloader
Chonker!
Quite fitting
Resting on his laurels
🤣
All he needs now is a beer
Ok
Another day, another obese animal on the front of /r/aww.
Cute Chonker
Yes.
[r/catsortofgivingup?](https://amp.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/)
They spelled "best" wrong
If I'd seen the last frame without the rest of the video I'd have called it photoshop.
*its like I was born to do this*
Dammmm
Ok chonker
/u/vredditdownloader
Meh, he’s ok.
Looks a bit like a kangaroo.
"Time for coco to be coco."
Oh yes!!
Actually, that’s a perfect chomnk!
my brother gave me a shirt that says "world okayest sister" on it <3
Blessed reposti
Your cat and I have similar posture.
Reminds me of the adorable Venezuelan Poodle Moth
what a Cat-ass-trophy.
HE BE THICC THO
Aw, he sits like a person.
This kitty dude is the Tseyako Ever!
Just ok is not ok
