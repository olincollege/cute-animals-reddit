that little head tuck every time is adorable
Damn you cat allergies.... I need some of these cuddles.
Flop to the right needs work
Holy shit, this is insane! This is me, and our Nala. Video from 2015.

It‚Äôs the third time on the Frontpage the past month after two versions of [LET ME IN](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/edda78/pinky_and_the_brain/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), and I still have a buzz from that.

And now this again. I love you Reddit
Cat version of a trust fall.
How does this guy not crack one smile at his adorable kitty flopping over in his arms?!
Who The hell can play laid back like that? If I‚Äôve got a controller in my hands I‚Äôm invariably perched right on the edge of my chair.
This dude has a concerned father look 24/7 that only becomes more concerned when his kitty relaxes onto him
Her name is Nala! Instagram is living with nala in case anyone wants to see more of her cute fluffiness
Is it weird I kinda wanna snuggle with this dude too? That's some prime nook snuggling.
Full video for y'all. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzqndXLTlFc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzqndXLTlFc&t=7s)
My cat used to do this q lot some years ago. Sadly he died and i completely forgot how it feels to lay down and  have a cat in your chest to pet. 
This feels very nice to watch, though.
Dude loves that red shirt
They are both easily amused.
Love how the cat gets fatter and progressively lazier.
AS Roma fan, nice.
Nothing is worse than when I am playing a video game and the cat want me to sit so he can be comfy. 

Cat usually wins against me too.
I‚Äôve been looking for this for the longest time. He posted it as a comment a long time ago so it was difficult to find it
that is adorable, and the head tuck just gets me, what a gorgeous cat
He looks so much like [my cat!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/637146648748752906/667829801985507328/image0.jpg)

I wish my cat was affectionate like this. He kinda just sits 5 feet away from me and looks at me.
Snuggly little floof,  he's so lucky.
Hes hot asf and he has a cat 10/10
This guy looks too cute to spend so much time alone in bed with his video game controller and cat. But it does seem peaceful!
We had a house panther that would flop from the arm of the chair to his back between the chair and your leg.
Why can‚Äôt my cat be that affectionate?
I love how its leg popped up on the third image.
/r/CatFlops 

Of course that's real. Why wouldn't it be?
Legend has it, he still is nowhere near finishing that game
"Dad will catch me and hold me"
He looks so much like [my cat!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/637146648748752906/667829801985507328/image0.jpg)
I would pay good money to train my cat to do that
My ovaries just exploded.
Dammit, that's so cute warm and fuzzy I'm gonna start hacking up a furball.
Perfect loop.
*plop*
His little leg was even cuter... :)
They both cute
I‚Äôm not a gamer and I just realized how much a cat would love a gamer for things like this.
My cat does this all the time to me. I have multiple pictures of him waking me up in the middle of the night because he needed to snuggle right next to me.
Jesus Christ that's one of the most adorable things i've ever seen. This cat needs to be a mascot for this sub.
Why does this guy not look happier?
My German Shepherd does this exact thing every time he gets in bed and wants me to pet him while he falls asleep
u/thisisantwon its you, but with a cat
He looks so annoyed lol
r/cuddleroll
Flops more than lebron james
This is my favourite thing I have ever seen on reddit
Made me giggle so much, especially when he‚Äôs playing the game!
My cat insists on standing on me for a good half a minute. With me begging for him to lay down since his paws are spearing me. Then he curls up, I either get the nice face snuggle, or his bulk across my throat suffocating me. ;o
URGH. FINE. I‚Äôll marry you. But only if the cat comes with.
I love how the guy looks down at the cat every time, you know, just to make sure she made it okay.  Adorable!
I'm impressed he isn't more rotund from all that lying around.


The man. Not there cat. Scratch that. Both.
Kitty:  ‚ÄúIf I fall will you catch me?‚Äù
This is living with Nala on insta! Shes so cute its untrue
Love
He clearly flops best when wearing red shirts.
I sincerely do not comprehend how people can still so widely hate on cats!! They are so WONDERFUL , they make great pets. This man and his cat have such a bond it's heart warming. I understand liking a certain animal more than a different one, but to blindly hate cats is just mind blowing. They are the best
I'm not sure who's cuter: the cat for doing its thing, or it's owner recording it.
Not surprised. Cat people are weird as shit.
Awe! What a great kitty. My cat just recently started doing this this year. She's about 7-8 years old now and I'm so thrilled about it. The only thing that kills me is her adorable "Noooo" meow that she makes when I gently coax her into getting off because I have to use the bathroom or because a limb is sore.
The toe flooooooof omg
Aww, kitty "trust falls"! There is nothing better than a good feline friend that trusts you completely.
Every time it seems to know...

__imma fall...falling...weee__
*Cat Arm Flops* - the latest college band from Athens GA
I think I just fell in love.
Does this thing just keep looping?  I don‚Äôt know when it starts and ends!
Awww, that's his snuggle spot!
I dont know when this stops or starts but ive probably watched it for 10 minutes
This cured my depression.
My cat has made it a habit to pin my arm into the side of the chair in a quest for attention. And typically only if I‚Äôm on the computer or have a game controller in hand.
My cat literally just did this. Yes, I typed this one handed.
And I'm ever so slightly nudged in the direction of cat appreciation...
they wonder, together
Amateur, had a 7month baby on my lap that was mashing my keyboard for fun while im trying to playing Hell let loose.
Cats are needy fucking assholes. I fucking love them.
This is so sweet.
I have same looking cat and i basically dream that she behaves like this :(
This guy gets to play video games and chill with his cat on the daily. This guy is living the life!
my tuxedo used do this all the time in the first year after i adopted her! 3 years later and she only does it extremely rarely now. too cute!
That couch looks super comfy tho....
Meanwhile my cat would just as soon eat my eyeballs.
My cat will do this while I'm trying to play video games. Then I'll try to hold the controller in a comfortable position and she just starts rabbit kicking
Holy shit I didn't realize this was a thing other cats do. My cat flops SO HARD. Good to know it has a name.
Cat records a sampling of his failed attempts to reanimate his hooman during the course of 1 hooman year.
hol up so this guy just sets down his camera in front of him for an entire year to catch his cat fumbling?
*buys cat*
This is so freaking cute
How do you get your cat to like you?
Oh yea I know abt this guy and his Norwegian Forest cat videos ü•∞
That is so freaking cute. Back legs in the air and all. :)
If it weren't for video games would your cat get enough snuggles?
This guy owns like three shirts.
The cat should do a video...The human doesnt do anything when I flop!
I die for him. I die for this cat and his fluffy peets!!
That guy is HOT! The cat is very cute also ‚ù§
This cat really enjoys flopping onto its left more than to its right.
The little sliiiiiide and upside down head are adorbs.
That is pure love
Fucking people claim cats aren‚Äôt  cuddlers
Both the cat and the guy are cute = cuteness overload
The flop and head tuck must be purfected!
But....he looks so annoyed
Isn‚Äôt it sad these creatures want to engage, while all we want is to be left in peace with our technology? 

I try to put the iphone down now a few times a day for 15 mins to play and really engage with my dog.
cat is cute, guy is cuter.
First one could be considered an accident almost, but it went so well and enjoyable for the cat he rxshe just kept doing it. By the third time you know it‚Äôs deliberate and those are my favorite awwwws to have. When it‚Äôs not just an accident.
Cats be floppin
Dude only has three t-shirts, never uses the candles and keeps the same assortment of junk on his table the entire year? Going to call "fake" on the year claim and suggest this was made in a week.
Lovely tribute
My dog does that too :D
"I love you, man!"
Does he only have three shirts?
Watching this with my cat on top of me, a rare occurance as he usually goes straight for the arm book. Cats are the best. And often the worst.  It right now the best.
Ugh mine does this every night at bedtime. <3
-plop-
Aww. He does it on purpose! I wish my kitty was affectionate.  All she does is poop, eat and destroy my furniture
I swear one of my dogs is half cat because she does the same thing!
I just gave my cats the stink eye for slacking off
I like how one day the cat mixes it up and flops the opposite way
He trusts his dad will always be there to catch him!
I wish I had a cat. Or 3 cats and 2 dogs...
I wish my cat liked me this much omg.
This cat could be a professional footballer!

He‚Äôs just getting comfortable
Owner: "you know why you need me cat? Companionship."

Cat: "Bodyheat"
Probably only time I‚Äôd buy a dashcam
It is a beautiful thing to watch the pure love between you and your sweet kitty
So cute
Dude games
And idiots still say cats aren't affectionate.
I want a floppy arm cat
When the cat flopped, I felt that.
Sweetest thing I ever did see
Cat got a little chubby
Looks like the actor from the show Legion
Crackhead ninja?
How can you not love cats?
My dog and cats do that to me too... Awkward when I got two cats and my saint pyr lands on me to get in on the action...
That cat got really fat
Her little foot popping up every time is the best part.
How does he remain so straight faced? I'd die of cuteness everytime!
my cat crawls on me, flops, then gets up immediately, then flops again.  he never actually lays down to rest for more than a second and it's super annoying.
Thicc
How does he know this is all of them?
This is a very long video. Much appreciated
ight imma head in.
Aw, he looks just like my dear departed fluffball Dave. Such a great cat.
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how you wear a watch lol
üÖ∞Ô∏èüÖæÔ∏è
Forza Roma
My cat does the exact same thing, except mine is a Maine Coon (so the flop is way bigger).    This is her way of telling me she wants her belly rubbed - which she LOVES.
Gaming, gaming, gaming.
Never using the candles.
ü§î
For me it was the dander that I was allergic to for other cats. I don't get a reaction even if I bury my face into my cat's fur now, but if he nibbles on my arm or gets his claws in my leg for some reason then I do get some temporary localized swelling where he broke skin but it's really rather minor compared to how it was before. Definitely do some research and a few visits to the cat before you decide! I couldn't imagine a worse situation than bringing home a cat and bonding with them to only realize that you can't keep them.
Trust fall!
FinnA take a mustache ride
Cute but if this man is single I'm more impressed he has actual decor on the walls etc.. When I was bachelor I don't think I decorated any apartment I lived in besides the bare necessities.
He got healthier looking once he got a PS4.

It has done the opposite for me lol
The dedication for showing off kitty love is so fulfilling. He has accomplished everything he needs in 2020.
I‚Äôm in love
Haha that's great my cat prefers the space between my legs when I lay them across the sofa. Every night she tucks herself in and stretches the full length of my legs
Guy never burns his candles I see.
Our cat does this to us constant.
this guy is hot
Omg those toe fluffs!
He doesn't use those candles, like, at all.
I was straight a minute ago, but I'm marry him for the cat.
Don't lose your arm.
TRUST FALL!
How can anyone not like cats.
Is he editing this into a Thunderstruck cover?
Omg his little leg at the end melts my heart
The little leg raise gets me everytime
is that antoni fantano?
 Very cute and cuddly kitty. His owner is a lucky guy!
I wished my cats were that loving. They don‚Äôt like being held.
Not once does he smile! If a head tilt doesn't make you smile, you should get your face checked.
She knows Dad will always catch her <3
Why did you make up a fake title though? No where in the youtube video does it say this was recorded over a years time. Thats just false. Stop making up fake titles.
My car was just like this then, ran away or was taken by the animals. The cats with this type of personalities are so awesome
That's a good kitty.
I too love big fluffy kittens and Diadora!!
My cat just passed away and she use to bump her head on mines all the times. Looking at this makes me wish I had atleast one video to look back at to remember.
What a little sweetie. The back foot kick up is the cutest part.
u/vredditdownloader
Very cute. How come my cats don‚Äôt know id be down for my cats to lay on me?
I'm probably alone in this; but titles that make wild inferences like this drive me nuts.

&#x200B;

You really think he had a camera set up to record ALL arm flops at all times for a year? No, this is just a compilation of a several arm flops.

&#x200B;

This is a pretty harmless instance; but I see titles like this on reddit all the time and it drives me bat poop crazy.
This put a smile on my face ü•∞
Why does everyone have a sweet and affectionate cat except for me?????????????????????????????????????????????????????
The owner reminds me of professional wrestler Zach Sabre Jr.
why
He's hot.
I have a similar breed of cat, and he's just as lovable as this ones seems.
Playing video games with a cat on you is the best way don‚Äôt u/ me
i love how he looks at his cat everytime he flops üò≠
this guy looks so annoyed with his cat
Ambidextrous flop/head butt.
That is the cutest trust fall I've ever seen

Keep that Roma jersey. Totti forever!
FORZA ROMAAAA!

Also, very cute floppy cat!
thank you
I wanna you touch him!!
This guy ever move besides to change his shirt?
I kept looking at the candles that never burned any further.  Definitely doesn't have a romantic life.  But lots of "kitty" action.
Definitely a Gfycat.
Is that xqcüòÇ
Leg up!
Adorable cat. Fake ass flowers
That‚Äôs not all of them!
That cat looks and acts like my roommate's cat. I wonder if it's just the breed?
This was actually in a day, he just changed his clothes.
One of our cats does this when he‚Äôs being a ploppy boops kitty.
Too cuteüòª
Does he just film himself all the time waiting for his cat to flop?
Massive waste of time, well done.
My ps4 controller lasted me 2 years
Forza Roma!
Tight!
"I'm better than this black warm thing you are playing with!"
Such a good kitty
I miss my big fluffy cat
Lol my cats don't come to my lap when I have the controller in my hand, they've learned that I'm prone to sudden movements and standing up randomly, not very relaxing for them.
He looks just as annoyed as I do when my cat insists on lying on me and trapping me on the couch
Forza Roma! :)
These were not accidents, :)
Daje Roma!

That foot salute ahhhhhhhh!

Oh man... that is the same kind of cat my grandparents had.  Her name was Kiki.  She was so loving and amazing.  My grandfather taught her to jump up on the kitchen table and sit on her haunches and beg for food.  Kiki was run over by a car.  Grandpa buried her in the back yard under a dogwood tree.  He used to go out and sit on a chair under that tree in the evenings.
Long haired cats, "I love you forever please give me attention!"

Short haired cat owners, "Yeah we have a cat. He's somewhere, but don't try to pet him or he will claw the crap out of you.
Daje Roma!
How can people not like cats?
What a wholesome video, also FORZA ROMA
He loves that Roma jersey
I really thought my cat was the only one who did this! He would walk across my chest and then flop expecting me to catch him and hold him like a baby. I would, every time (because how am I to deny something so cute) but idk how he even got the idea or where it started. He loved to be cuddled and carried around. He was adorbs. I'm sad I don't have videos of it. Props to this dude.
Wow so cute !!
I wish your cat made you smile a little bit.
Any Reddit veterinarians gonna tell us how this is a sure sign that the cat has leukemia?
This is one of the first posts I saw when I first found Reddit
yeahhhhh roma!
Cat activated Slide N Flop! It‚Äôs super effective!
Sooo...like 10 times over the year?
ITS SOO FLUUUUFYYYYYYY!  
But in all seriousness. I want to snuggle this gato.

Get a life omg
Cat loves its human
It's like you can see him slowly becoming a serial killer
I‚Äôm convinced shaggy from scooby doo made this. I mean, look at him in a green shirt!
Not the hero we wanted but the hero we needed
My cat stands on my chest when I'm lying down on the couch and gets mad if I don't move my arm to the right place to allow him to do this.
I have the exact same problem with my 15 lb Shih Apso.
That cat may have lots of issuses, but trust isn't one of them
I‚Äôm going to need a pair of kitties like this thanks
My cat used to do this and take his naps in my arm.. but for some reason he just suddenly quit doing it and won't stay when you put him there anymore.

Wonder if I rolled over on him in my sleep at some point.

Now he's just a crotch kitty. If I'm laying down anywhere, that's where he goes to sleep.
Throw it
This guy making sacrifices‚Äî-laying down, near motionless,  while gaming is an almost impossible feat
Cat allows to record. ftfy
Glad to see Tom Cruise is still doing well
none of those were even good. tf is this
People ask me why I love cats
My cat does that but rips my shirts.
Love the controller in hand. How many time my chonk would make it impossible to play. How I miss that monster.
quite a ***jellicle cat***, I'm sure you will agree

Because Jellicles are and Jellicles do

Jellicles do and Jellicles would

Jellicles would and Jellicles can

Jellicles can and Jellicles do
I see like 10 years man.
Is this guy always filming himself in his own house??
I'm a dog guy through and through but this shit is fantastic!

No that's tom cruise.
/r/catflops
Seems like he never lights those candles.
He sat there for a year to record his cat impressive
She looks exactly like my girl.
This is definitely r/gifsthatkeepongiving material.
Over the span of a year? That was like 12 individual videos? You‚Äôre telling me that guys cat laid on him 12 times in an entire year?

This is why I am a dog person...
i love cats so much.
So many flops
Not sure how many times it cycled before I realized that the gif was cycling...
I had a cat who loved to do this.  He was so affectionate and cute.  One day I thought it would be funny to not support him with my arm.  He crawled up all happy and proceeded to plop him self off my torso and onto the floor.   
  
It was not funny.  It was as though I had broken his trust.  He wouldn't do it anymore after that.  He got I'll and I had to put him down just a couple years later.  This was 10 years ago.  I still feel bad, and never take a cat's cuddilyness for granted.
Where do I find a loving cat? Mine runs away from me constantly
If I did this, no one would believe it‚Äôs real because it would show the same shirt everyday...
This is the cutest post of 2020!
I bet he is a Roma fan.
Possibly dumb question but are there certain cat breeds that are more affectionate than others?

My sister has a cat but it hates to be picked up and never climbs to your lap.

Maybe its more of a personality thing?
Is this cat my dog?
That guy is pretty cute. Not going to lie.
That is one adorable floof.
Lovely!
He looks just like xQc
This is beyond adorable.
Nice Roma t-shirt!
Gorgeous‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh is that all internet points take? I‚Äôm gonna blow everyone‚Äôs mind. Just gimme some time. 

Needless to say, awww.
Holy shit for a second I thought he was me and my mind almost melted.
The last Jedi
Fuck, the amount of trust this cat has for it's human is unbelievable.  

I need this kind of support in my life lol
floof
Some day he‚Äôll be scratching his head, the cat will arm flop to the ground, and there‚Äôs no getting that trust back!
That‚Äôs a cat who loves that dude more than anything....lucky dude...
I love the part where the cat flops
Matt Bellamy and his cat
No matter what the cat is doing that guys awesomeüòä
Why does he look so annoyed by that? :c
My cat does this too! Except he kicks my hand for no reason while I'm playing.
Yhy6ujj7uuuu
wowwww
Where is the extended cut? Directors cut? Extra footage? I need more!
ok, but how?
Never owned a cat or spent time around one before because I'm allergic, is that like a common thing that all cats do with their owner??
I wish I wasn‚Äôt allergic to cats...
Yo, your other post has no awards wtf
I have two shizhus that do this. So is their cat like my dogs, or is it the other way around.
Forza Roma!
EVERYBODY DO THE FLOP

Why does he look so pissed off sometimes? I would love it if my cat wanted to cuddle. My cat will rarely let me cuddle him. And then only for a few minutes at a time.
How the hell does he not smile?
That is one happy trusting cat.
My cat does the same thing. :) He loves sitting on my arms when Im gaming too haha

Arm flops are the best!
My schip¬∑per¬∑ke mix does this, I'll stretch out on our love seat and she'll jump right into my arm like this, then she'll touch my nose with her wet nose. I love her, she's barks a lot and annoys my wife but she's a sweetheart.
He looks happy but disappointed at the same time

r/armflop
I‚Äôm sorry, but why doesn‚Äôt this guy look happy?! You have a floofy cat flopping into your arms and can remain expressionless?!
Omg I feel this dude, my cats sometimes decides to just sit right on top of my chest and is like... 'stop with the games, more with the pats and scritches' 

And I'm like 'YOURE KILLING MY CHARACTER IN GAME, I HAVENT SAVED AAAA'
Forza Roma!
This guy is a Roma fan
Ngl, I would smuggle with a cute guy like that. Ohh and the cat join in too.
Can you wear the watch on your wrist?
Mate... I feel this so much, my pup nestles next to my face and rests his head on my shoulder when I'm in the same position playing my games.

Such a happy and needed moment after a hard day of work.
This guy looks pissed with his cat but no matter how annoyed he is, when the cat is gone, he will miss him.

And the fact that he recorded all the arm flops over a year suggests that despite his facial expressions, he loves the fluffy little guy...
The feets!!!
My question is whats the timing that you can record these.
Such floof!
And strangely enough, plopping into the arm puts that arm out of commission for smart phones or gaming, while the other arm is busy giving scritches. Smart cat wins the war for attention.
Was he just casually filming himself all the time?
Cute
You don‚Äôt kick the cat off while playing video games... you just don‚Äôt.
Holy shit your cat is litterally identical to my baby river. Adorable
Guy is stuck to his couch for a year. News at 11!

Can I make a suggestion for another year-long compilation?  
It involves peanut butter!  Any guesses?  


You make a PBJ sandwich!   
You eat it 365 bites at a time. A new sandwich each and every day.

You edit each day to the corresponding bite out of the sandwich.   
Trust me, it can be done. I tested it out the other day.   
I must admit, I lost interest in the whole venture after the 43rd bite   
but in the beginning - It Felt Real!

  
I desperately want to relive that experience. What do you say?   
Do I have your attention?
Oww cute
I don‚Äôt know why but I know this dude is British for some reason.
My cat lays on my legs not stomic but can still relate!

Why is this guy constantly filming himself?
So cute üòª

This guys posture must be fucked.

I‚Äôm sure this guy does not play FromSoftware games with a cat on his chest.
This makes me happy üòç
This is too much, my heart is crying
The guy just looks annoyed. Never smiled once. Pay attention to the cat already.

Forza Roma
This guy is so lonely.
Props for wearing a Roma jersey...

Adorable
Best thing I've ever seen!
I show cute cat videos like this one to my big chonk...he still doesn't want to chill with me.

I still love him though, that's what matters.
Oh he is a lil C H O N K Y thang
No diamond shorts in evidence. This was winter?
‚ÄúCatch me, hooman!‚Äù
Dude has an awesome friend for life! My Ozzybear has been flopping in my arms for some 15 years now! When the right cat selects you as their human, thats it, they will lobe you forever! They will never leave your side.

I liked the part where the cats feet were stuck in the air
god damn i miss my cat. Its been a decade and i think about her all the time.
Never be inconvenienced by a pet's affection as the reaper waits for for none and memories lack warmth.
Oh my god, that cat is adorable!
I'm going to marry that man.
The perfect gamer kitty.
CATO really like hooman
If I fits, I flops.
Total trust in human
Animal lover.  Fluffy cat.  PS4.  Looks like heaven. ü•∞
I love the flops.
I love the little foot twitches ü•∞
t r u s t f l o p
what a sad year
Cats don‚Äôt love you
I wish my cats would sit on me üò≠
I bet that's a Siberian Forest Cat. Mine looks just like it. Such a fluff!
My cat is like this too...hes so overbearing it's starting to cause friction in my marriage lol.
cats are so cool
This is the best thing!! I'm smiling so hard right now
That is entirely too cute!
Ugh, I miss having a floofy cat so much. I could watch this flop**PUFF**headtuck on a loop for ages.
!
I like when she kicks her little leg up when she falls! So cute!
People who aren't cat people never had a cat like this growing up.

So damn cute.
I miss my kitty :(
I can't stop giggling this is so cute
awwwwwwwWWW^w^h^h^h~!
This cat has so much charisma!
I love this so much that I just can‚Äôt deal
But wh....oh! Adorable ‚ô•Ô∏è
Btw . ...why does this guy not smile ONCE !  Also why does he never talk to his gorgeous loving baby .... Kitty Mommy here
So cute
what a cute fluffy cat <3
This is so damn cute, but he has patience because my cat would be out the room if he obstructed my video games like that lmao.
I dont know why but I'm getting a vibe that dude is depressed. :( cute kitty though :)
No one‚Äôs gonna mention how this guy looks like robert deniro when he was in taxi driver?
OMGOODNESS what BS you're spinning there!
This says more about the human than the cat. The cat just adapted it's need for attention to fit the scenario. His video game zombie of an owner always sit's in this position. Path of least resistance and boom you trained your cat to do an adorable armflop.
So little hugs. Just gaming
Epic Trust Falls...er....rolls
I'm sorry!  Really I am sorry for my opinion I'm about to give...

Looks like he is on the couch way too much with a bitter face.  This cat has gotten fatter as such.  This type of lifestyle brings misery, trust me.  I've lived it, I'm still living it.  It sucks, it really sucks.  The times I actually break the habit and do something worth while i feel great.  It's way too easy to become paralyzed on the couch, it's addicting. 

Please for your and my sake, do something
Man that is a sad life, how does he continue bothering to live
I don't get it... He just has a cam recording him while he plays? Is he a twitcher or something?
Only thing this shows is a cute kitty and some lazy assed MOFO who spends his life playing video games like a child.
