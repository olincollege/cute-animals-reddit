That’s the purest thing ever.
This may be the most adorable thing I have ever seen
Without exaggeration, one of the best things I’ve ever seen.
r/bearsdoinghumanthings
This is STUPID cute. The noises I'm making at this are probably screechy enough to summon dolphins
Now that is awesome
MA!!! ITS SNOWING!!
He's bearly doing it though.
Seeing this is such a great start to the new year.
I’m bummed that bears are so adorable but I know I’ll be torn to shreds for trying to cuddle one
PADDINGTONNNN
Now that’s fucking cuuute! 😍

Everytime I see something like this, I genuinely become enraged by how my education neglected to mention how fucking sentient and human-like all animals are. As a child it was just like "here's a bear, it's an animal, nothing more to see here".
It almost looked like a toddler on its 2 feet.
He ✨dance✨
Finally actual r/aww worthy content
Thanks OP for improving everyone's days
Am I the only one wondering why this bear is not in hibernation? 😳
I like it when he stands up and goes wigly-wigly with his body while trying for those snowflakes..
Playfulness in nimals is so cool, even if some of the playing is role playing to get them ready for adulthood. Its a common thread between us and the animal world
"You can't catch them son. I've spent years trying to capture that which falls, but it always fades into nothingness, a semblance of my efforts"
The sheer adorableness is unbearable!
Don't think I've seen something as pure as this all year!
I can’t bear any more cuteness
It’s like the bear just realized it was snowing.
Omg my heart
Awwww.  He’s like “Mama, look!”.  So adorable lol
I'm glad to know we can all be delighted with falling snow.
Kids come in all shapes and sizes!!! 🐾😻🐾
I think this is the first time I've seen an animal take in the wonder of the world
ARENT they supposed to be hibernating or something ??
Bears always seem like they are just a few generations away from becoming bipedal.
Kids do the same thing with bubbles so adorable
I kept waiting for the parents to come back and grab the cub "let's GO!"
That's fascinating... Makes me want to become a Vegan, not that I eat bears or anything 🤔 I just wonder what else wonders...
omg omg omg seratonin overload
Be careful out there, little guy.
Just watched this on loop to Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta love. Changed my life.
This looks just like any toddler doing the same thing, complete with wobbly legs.
That’s precious. Just askin tho, where was this at? That seems like a residential neighborhood and I was always taught (apparently incorrectly) that bears avoided highly populated areas.
Lil guy then went around the house to ravage the garbage and spread it evenly all over the back yard, awww
How to save video, pls?

This is amazing. I wish our bear family was this patient.
I’m in awww for real!!! 🥰
It was about this time that the drugs took hold.

I want to swaddle it and hold it close to my body.  Too bad the mama would rip me ten new a$$holes if I tried to do that. So cute. 😍
Drunk bear
How adorable to have seen that in person.  All young lives whether human or small animals they all love the snow.
Go home bear, your drunk
I swear bears can act just like human children sometimes. It's too cute!
Then he waddled away.

(waddle waddle)
That Baby Bear is experiencing pure joy and fun.
I can’t stop watching this over and over.  This has got to be One of the cutest bear snow dances I’ve ever seen in my lifetime.

This is soooooo cute.
They're all cuddly and fuzzy when you can out run them... but they grow up fast, and suddenly you're what's for dinner.
In elementary school i did this with leaves in the fall during recess. Not alot of friends i was the weird kid.
Don’t they hibernate by now?

Awww.omffggg!! Cuutteee!!!
I see a cute baby bear, I upvote. It's a simple equation really
I just want to hug it. I hear bears give real good hugs.
Don’t be silly this is just some kids dressed as a bear trick or treating

Looks like me taking a field sobriety test
This made my night. I needed it. Thank you!!!!
Where can I get one?
This is so fucking special 🥺

Sometimes I forget how beautiful the world can be
The close proximity of the bear to someone's household makes this video cute but scary
Bears just hang out in that neighborhood?
Que ternuraaaaa
Kids will be kids!
So damn cute.
Ahhh, so cute and cuddly 🐻
Oh how cute...until Mama comes at you and does it to you like in Revenant!
Right on little dude. Snow is magic at first site.

This is one of, if not the most adorable thing I've ever seen.
Cute
Plot twist, it actually saw a UFO and wanted to go for a ride
That's clearly Ed Grimley in a bear suit
He bear-ly caught any snowflakes ❄
I don’t get it..... 

I would be scared AF to leave my house knowing there are bears just scrolling the sidewalk

They've been doing this for thousands of years confirmed on video in front of some dudes garage
Are we sure this isn't baby bear catching an Uber ride?  Looks about 8 miles from an urban center.
This is going to be on "This is your daily dose of internet".
Question, what kind of bear is best ?
good god
He's sooooo stupid. There are plenty of snowflakes already on the grass 🙄
So, Disney movies are real. I knew it!
Haha.  Love it.  A toddler is a toddler.
That is really cute

This is one if the cutest things!!
Why do so many different creatures do this?
2021 is looking hopeful
Pure joy :)

I wanna download this amd play it constantly on me tv
I want to make a joke about putting this baby black bear in a tuxedo,  but I'm not sure how to enrage both the racists and the snowflakes.
"MAMA! I caught one!"

"Hon, we gotta get off the nice man's property."
This only supports my theory that bears are humans in bear costumes

That title made me think it was a Proud Boys post
Whenever I see bears, they always look like slightly dumber humans in a bear suit. Some of their behavior is so human-like it's odd.
Cutest thing ever!
No matter the species, kids all act in a similar manner.
Awww!
Adorable
Bears are so cute. And smart! Too bad their diet seems to consist of exactly what a raccoon  eats nowadays, at least in suburban areas. Feed your bears healthy!
There is nothing cuter in this world.

This is a humanised interpretation. The bear cub was interviewed later and he claims that he was throwing his hands up in horror, saying "It burns, it burns"
Lol cute.
