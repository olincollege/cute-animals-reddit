A+ for effort and execution
I want a German shepherd so bad. 
Doggie brain: 

Ooh that looks fun. Give me hoop, human. Ty.

Now, hold on, what were you doing?

Ah yesh.. CIRCLES.

THIS IS MY DOG! Her name's sarge and she's a good girl!! 
Oh my God, he actually tried to work out how to use it! Dogs are so much smarter than we think.
I hope that dog has a job. Smartie pants. 
"How do you work this infernal contraption!?"
/r/likeus 
That dog may not be Jesus, but he's sure as hell a great Shepherd.
Are we just going to ignore the awesome Halloween sweater and Christmas socks
He does it sooo much better than me.
Tell him I'm very proud
That floor is a perfect example of why no one should install pergo in their house.
This actually made things ok for a minute.
My naym is dog 

An wen I snoop

My human fren

Playin' with a hoop,

She spins and twirlles

With plastic loop,

I uoise my teef

That girl has her socks on the wrong feet.

Guys, I think we've been doing it wrong 
"How you do that shit you witch? Goddamn hoop magic and shit..."
Wait, why is she wearing different colored socks? Or there's a dog too?
Nailed it
Possibly the most adorable thing I've seen all day. 

Dogs are so awesome. 
I can never get over the intelligence and personality differences in dogs

You all need to use a special kind of floor cleaner, regular cleaner and water will warp the floor, well even more. Google it
"I'm doing it, right?"
Cool, different color socks.
This is one of the best things I've seen, warmed my stone heart to a pleasant 64 degrees Fahrenheit 
That is one smart dog...wow. 
She looks like a Nintendo switch with those socks lol
OH MY GOD HE'S SO ADORABLE
He's doing his best.
Nailed it!
This made my life
This just made my night <3 such a precious doggo 10/10
I see dozens of gifs of animals doing cute little things, but I could watch this all day
A+ for the red and green sock
So this is what upstairs neighbors do. 
Stop doing it wrong, human!
Smart dog’
"Am I doing this right? I'm totally doing this right!"
IM DOING IT! AM I DOING IT?! IM DOING IT!
You better have given him treats for that
Normally I hate these funniest dogs in the world bits but that was adorable as fuck.
I am become Hula, bringer of hoops. 
Just reason number 5 million and 12 German Shepherds are the best dogs. 
He just wants to play too!
To paraphrase B. Franklin- "Dogs are proof that God loves us, and wants us to be happy."

Thanks for posting, this is awesome!
+1 For effort


He's recently "found" himself after attending a String Cheese Incident concert. When he hula hoops to the music, it sets his spirit free. 
Love this. Want more.
I want a breed of dog like him so bad. They're intelligent and loving.
I'm doing it! Am I doing it? Am I? I'm doing it! Look! 
sorry dog, your body is made only for running and biting
"NO NO NO NO! Let ME show you how to do it!"
You know, for dogs!
By the end, he was like, "Shit, it's not working. Oh wait, I haven't tried going in the other direction"
He protec
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
That's a very well laid floor right there.
Well, he's doing about as good as the girl. 
/r/EyeBleach
lol he's tryin
I think dogs are getting a little too smart...

Prepare for world domination by doggos
Big pupper so talented and smart 
Try skipping rope next. 
Thats adorable 
Anything with a dog I will upvote all day long.
I want to upvote this 100 times
Thank you. GSDs are the best. 👍
Beautiful. A+
As a german shepard owner; can confirm. He loves to steal whatever we play with and attempt to do better. Ex: soccer, basketball, sweeping the floor, etc.
That is so cute
This is delightful
This is definitely me if I were a doggo
"Am I doing it?!"
"Want a plane that loops the loop 
Me, I want a hula hoop" 
That is awesome!
Haha he does a pretty good job 
That’s just outstanding.
Lol at this attempt 
Too cute! You have to love German Shepherds.
Chocolate sets off endorphins? That mimic love.  I think DOGS so as well.  I don't even know this dog but watching this makes me less suicidal:)
please......no.
Ah yes. I too am an owner of Pergo floors. I feel your pain.
U r cool and your dog moreso
They need to lay down a new floor.
Actually the hula hoop gained angular momentum that forced the dog to spin.
I think he's got the hang of it.
Dogs are so good.
That's the cutest thing I've seen in a while!!
Goodest of girls
Lol this is my roommate what 
Wonder if he felt he accomplished lol
GET HIM HIS OWN HOOP YOU MONSTERS
What an absolute sweetheart 
Plot twist: 

Doggo: “get off my best friend!!”

Doggo forces the hula hoop to experience the same fate 
Aww x3
I just about died when he started spinning around 
Nice effort by shepherd 
He literally knows what to do with it! As a hooper of almost 4 years hes starting off as most beginners do!
What a sweet baby 
/r/therewasanattempt/
The socks. Green and red. Starboard and port. This person need to switch sides of the socks too not confuse right and left of boats or planes.
Best video ever
That's how my toddler hulahoops!!! 
give this b o y e some schmackos
The world needs more of this. If this was the first preamble of the UN's constitution... the world would be a happier place. Jussayin
Such grace. 
I just can't not look at those non matching socks.
Now I want a German Shepard

God I love dogs.
Ooh he's tryin'

Am I doing it?  Am I doing it Carol?
I can't love this enough! 😍🤣
good dog
aww, that is very sweet :)
Such a wholesome doggo, sees owner doing circles, tries to do the same.

Dogs - 1
Cats - 0
Doggleganger
Love the Shepherds. 
Lost my shit when he started spinning...
amazing
Looks like a guy in a hoodie/onesie dabbing in the thumbnail. 

EDIT: watch videos before commenting. I thought that was the dog.
A German shepherd has the wrong kind of brain to figure out the hula hoop.  He uses logic to figure it out, but the logic just goes in circles.
So cute! 
Wish I can hear the sound, must be hilarious. 
Love it!!!
I want this :(
Teach him how to skateboard.
The ability of these GSDs is astounding. Mine constantly amazes me. Best dog I have ever had. I'm not young lol!!
This is like watching The Good Place: you're on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen and then being shocked and delighted by the outcome.
I feel so bad for him/her. They really want to do it but can't. I know they won't actually get upset but somehow that only makes it worse.
So cute
Wish I could hula boob the pups hula snoot
Goo boy!
Awwwwwww
Hoopboye does a try 
Day made. Thank you for sharing. I love the shit out of this.
[Every time my GSD runs I remember this thing.](https://youtu.be/EUXeFmz9ujY?t=6s)  He's a doofy soul but a loved one.  
Ayyy that's one jus one groovy doggo tryna hula poot with a moody mommo

He tried so hard, *and got so far*
That's a smart doggo. 
Smart dog, Ive watched this too many times
This is what I joined Reddit for 
Thanks for the biggest laugh of my day. 
Aww she's so happy
The dog has just invented even more effective work out.
This is a good boy
This reminds me of my dad's dog. If you dance he thinks you're playing with him!
Dawww close enough 
Look at her arms while she spins it hahhahahhah
Lol
I like the way the German Shepherd hula hoop. I do that sometimes too.
Treats awarded for being legitimately better at hula hooping than I am
So close and yet so far
You make it look so hard here let me show you, so easy 
Shepard:
Let me show u how it’s done u reddit nub
After wolves, German Shepards are the best. If you can get your hands on a ShepWolf mix you have the absolute best dog in the world. Smarter than you and absolutely vicious when it comes to protecting you and your kids.

Is that person who is hooping wearing different socks?

"Okay, YES! GOT IT! Now let's do this thing! Spin, baby, spin! Woo h- wait a second. How the heck was she doing that? This doesn't feel right. Uh. Guys? Help?" 
Can I teach my dachshunds this?
*drunk* If dogs did hula hoops, would they do it using their legs or their stomach.
He's trying his best 
How come you dont gotz dizzy hooman
I love dogs so much I can't describe it.
That dog hulas better than me.
Smart pup
Eh. Not as good as a cat. I will now leave this post behind as i flee from the amount of dog lovers who will now chase me...
Clearly looking to show the foolish human how it's done.
A+ for knowing whose dog this is?
Um... This is pretty impressive.
Try spinning, that's a good trick!
The animals are taking over
Who wore it better?
OH MY GODDDDD he started spinning with it because he wanted to do it too! I literally can't even I'm crying Omg. 
Disgusting. Look how the dog piss has swelled the seams in that laminate floor.
The real thing about this post, look at those socks. 2 different colours. Ugh
Switch socks
Lol!

Just proves German superiority. 
Somebody tell that doofus he's doing it wrong!  
When I do that I get made fun of. I'd like to see that dog study the blade as I have *teleports behind pupper unsheaths katana the child of many millenia*

"Heh, nothing personnel kid but this is your last radio partner"
Look at that floor!!
I can't get over the unpaired socks 
[deleted]
Stupid dog isnt doing it right
This is like when a robot tries to impersonate a human walking.
That dog is an asshole
HAHA. Stupid Dog. Hes doing it all wrong!!!
Hecken onions...

It's quite sad really. Like a child with cancer who realizes that he'll never grow up.
