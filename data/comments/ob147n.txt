foreground picture "do you think this is funny?  How about I poop in your shoe?!"
Why not frame this one as well.
She‚Äôs not amused üòÇ
This is Nala, our 11 year old floofy girl. 
I took me a few years before I got this framed. It has had a few good moments on Reddit the past years.

Classic cat behaviour.

"LEMME OUT! LEMME OUT! LEMME OUT!"

*Lets them out and 10 seconds pass*

"LEMME IN! LEMME IN! LEMME IN!"
What is its name?!
So cute! She's like "why? why have you done this to me?"
The face on that cat, not the one in the picture, is saying "This is some bullshit. You know that, right?"
She‚Äôd be like , you could have captured better pictures of mine
Snortgiggled at this.
Damn you, cat! You made me snort in public!
HILARIOUS!
I haven‚Äôt laughed this hard in a while. Amazing.
u/handro would you mind publishing the original picture? It will be a good meme
"Is my pain funny to you Carrol?! HUH?!"
My kitty is friend with your kitty on Instagram ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
We are so lucky our pets don‚Äôt have cameras
Am I a fucking joke to you!
That‚Äôs awesome lol. Can I buy one?
Kitty is not amuzed.
This really is the best picture ever. Nobody is allowed to have a bad day ever again with that hanging up in your house.
Fly, you fools!
My girlfriend whenever I take a picture of her making a funny face:
Best cat picture I‚Äôve seen so far!
It‚Äôs priceless!
Have fun dying in your sleep.
"You MOCK Nala? You laugh at her like the jester? Oh! Oh! Jail for father! Jail for father for One Thousand Years!!!!"
Kitty: ‚Äúdo you think this is a joke, Susan?‚Äù
Omg I‚Äôm dying here! Bwahahaha!!
Amazing what a difference 5 whole minutes will make.
"Really, Handro....really?"
‚ÄúWhy u do this hooman?‚Äù
" you think this is funny? Jim,I nearly died."
Nala! <3
This is awesome.
That face says, "We are not amused."
He so gonna eat your shoes
I love how the cat looks so offended by the picture hadjdjgwv
Dichotomy of Cat
This is like when my anxiety makes me remember that time I called my teacher "mum" and everyone laughed at me
You know what you gotta do, you gotta get this picture framed, then frame your cats reaction to this picture, and so on, and so on, in a neverending loop :D
That is awesome!
The trauma is real.
That is AWESOME!
ü§£
My paws are WET
"is I a joke to u, human?"
Let mee iiiin
LOL. You should post the original to r/photoshopbattles
Simply Amazing
This is hilarious! I love it.
Fluffy's never seen such bullshit.

They seem ... not impressed
The cat's looking at you like "I don't know why you can't be an adult about this Alice."
Now you need to frame this one!

Furrr real? This is the one you picked?
‚ÄúAm I a damn joke to you, Karen?‚Äù

Please sell prints
Cat: Am I a joke to you?

Rly? You framed this. My worst day. And you framed it. And now you're taking another one. I'm not the dog. I do not forget these things. Hahaha yeah keep laughing, it's so funny. We‚Äôll see who‚Äôs laughing when you slide into those boots you love for work tomorrow.
That picture has been my Twitter profile picture for the last year!
That ‚Äúfuck you, Carl‚Äù look is priceless.
Cat: mom throw that shit away right now!
The cat is totally Grubering the fall.

I swear you could win an award with this photo
THIS is now your new best picture. Frame it.

This face is the photo equivalent of the word ‚Äúmotherfucker‚Äù
u/TRBLdeadstar
This picture made me laugh so hard I cried then coughed up a lung. Then the comments made it worse. 

I can see my cats doing stuff like this. They are fluffy assholes. Especially our Maine Coon mix.

Bruh esty‚Ä¶
Should have photoshopped it so it looks like the cat is grabbing the frame.
‚Äòoh this is what we‚Äôre doing now? How about I frame a picture from that night when you were wasted throwing up in the toilet Stephanie. Would you fucking like that?‚Äô
"Why do you hurt me in this way?"
Ohmigosh üòÇ‚ù§
That‚Äôs awesome. Seriously
Matte was a mistake.
So hilarious!
Good times
A true masterpiece üòä
ü§£ü§£ü§£
‚ÄúAm I a joke to you?‚Äù
fantastic
I haven't seen a Schnoodle in a long time.
Lots of audible (and loud) laughter coming from my house right now. 

Amazing.
OP Is this the same cat who got spooked by the neighbour cat? That was good video...
Love your sense of humour
I have a cat that looks really similar but I don‚Äôt know what breed she is, what breed is Nala?
how cute
I have giggled at this for a good couple of minutes
Cute picture
‚ÄúYou pathetic bitch. This is all you have. You change my poop box, I‚Äôm the fucking lizard queen‚Äù - the cat probably
Human: Look Mr. Snuffles at this picture!

Mr. Snuffles: Who dat? A brother I don‚Äôt know? Are you cheating on me with a different cat? Are you‚Ä¶..are you replacing me?
Good to see you on Reddit. Your furbaby is adorable!!!!!!
Awww, my cat would fit right in
He's a big baby :3
Simply Amazing
Cat like that's my son

That really is a nice photo.
Kitty says: I‚Äôm not amused!

Anyone notice the limb in the back looks like something chasing him.
Fotogrophy

Beautiful
The ‚ÄúHang in There‚Äù poster we‚Äôve always truly wanted.
Your baby is on my [wall at work](https://imgur.com/a/ZbIxq44).

He definitely looks kind of proud of it.
Wtf is this carol?
Nice

I love this picture too.
Cat is Not amused lol
Looks my sweet cat Coby, who has never been outside and fights whenever I put him infront of a window!
Can I also get a copy of this photo? Phenomenal.
He has enough fluff for the snow , guess the problem was‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs wet
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
‚ÄúReally Bruh?!‚Äù
This is the best thing I've seen in a while! I'm considering framing the post of the cat being unhappy with the picture! üòª Thanks for making my day! - I reallyyyyy needed it!
Rubbing salt in the wound are we? üòÅ
Omg.. this is so amazing.. completely outstanding, however- I can't quite tell if he approves....
‚ù§Ô∏è
That picture is a catastrophic win
"Seriously, Clara? Seriously?"
# THANKS FOR THE GOLD KIND STRANGER
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve done this‚Äù
This is amazing

The cat's "wat da frank" face
That picture üòÇ
New best picture
Aww, lol
SO GREAT! (both pic and subjects comments!)
That is a very photogenic cat
Hilarious
Priceless
And here I am thinking it's supposed to be a mirror for a second
Holy shit I'm half asleep and it looked like one of those horror photos where someone is looking away from a mirror and their reflection is still looking haha.
EPIC! So funny!
Why am I thinking that this cat already knows how to repay you for your "kindness"? I would watch the toilet paper... They know what happens when there's shortage of it...
Not the mama!
That is the cutest thing EVER!!! What a unique grab :)
‚ÄúSusan, what the fuck is this???‚Äù-The Cat, probably
Love that
Hahaha this is gold!
Hahaha awesome
Now you have another one to frame
Anyone else think the background picture was of a cat scrambling out of a hot tub?
Fucking hilarious this made my day.
I just want to add thank you for making me laugh this hard.
Human what have you done
Yo I need a cat frfr
*The "I regret nothing" face.*

Making him relive his horror over and over again.
I‚Äôve laughed at this so many freaking times today.
What a handsome chap or classy lady, can‚Äôt tell
Front cat: "Watch your back human"
Gato knows you're mocking em. ü§£
OMG üòÇ 

Such fear from the past and then such contentment in the present.
Dope!!
"Yeah, I did stupid stuff on life 4. That was a weird one, don't ask about it."
This needs to be a painting
Now you need to have this one framed
This is fantastic!
I call it ‚ÄúLet me in‚Äù
Majestic!
This is the best picture
Ok this is gold. Lmaoooo
Cat: damn im good looking
Did he fall in water?
‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm kind of a big deal around here.‚Äù
Lol. Oh my God that cat hates your guts!
With that pic and this pic and the Schnoodle -- you have the beginnings of a great portrait wall.
Amazing.
Will you frame this one too? And then show it to him/her
LOL!!
Omg lololol
To much powder.... For the cat
Your cat looks disappointed in your choice of which photo to frame üòÇ
This made me smile. Thank you for sharing!!
The most expressive face!!
I must see the origins story of this epic tale.
She's like "dude what the hell"
I can‚Äôt stop laughing at this!!!
I think THIS is your best pictureüôèüíØ
The cat actually looks quite proud
"MY FEETS IZ WET!!!!!!"
Cute
Very handsome young man.
That face says she is definitely pooping in your shoes tonight.
She‚Äôs recovered nicely.
Picture?   Looks like a painting rather than a photo.  Is it just a photo stylized to look like a painting?
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
The cat's expression in this photo is pure gold!
This made me laugh out loud! What a precious picture!
The is genius

Hans gruber

The kitty: ‚ÄúAww you guys framed a picture of me, thanks‚Äù
He‚Äôs so fluffy üò©üò©
Best ever! Haha! Soooo cute üíñ
This has so much 2010 meme vibe
Bahahah Loove it.
"Sir, I am not amused."
lol I want a copy!
One of the best things on the old 'net.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: that pic is worthy of a thousand work pc backgrounds! lol
Kitty doesn't look impressed.
You have got to be kidding me...really.
Framception
You got to frame this picture too
Lol!  That Is a great picture!
The cat: really MF?
Now you must create a loop of him reacting to old pictures of him reacting to old pictures
[deleted]
Why you do this to me?
Look how annoyed kitty looks lololol
Cold abandonment. 2021. Oil on linen.
Sure, the one time I wasn't in total control, and the human had to take my picture...then the blasted human went and framed it!  They'll soon be a hairball left in their shoe.
For a second I thought was just a window and you had twins.
I love it
Oh fuck, I love this so much!! Bahahhaa!
Ah, another meme i can milk.
Your cat doesn‚Äôt look impressed but is impressed at the same time
Pretty cool picture lmao
I love it so much and it is not even my cat!
Remembering as a child
The cats like yeah, that was me.
Frame that picture now.
Cat: That‚Äôs me last winter. A human dared me to a snow angel challenge that I obviously won.. here most human think I‚Äôm yelling ‚Äúget me the meow out of there!!‚Äù.. man they are so dumb
"Am I a joke to you, Karen?"
A masterpiece
Yeah it was a repost of a picture.
I'm laughing tears rn. üòπ I can't look away.
