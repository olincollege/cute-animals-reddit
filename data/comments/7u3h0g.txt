Cool winter automotive accessory: can go for help if the car gets stuck.
Cerberus car security system.
I'm more impressed that all three can handle being on the same seat and not pushing each other out of the way.  
"It's too hot in this car"
I know right, surely one of them should be paying attention to the road.

A friend of mine in the 80's used to breed these dogs. They are Samoyeds and as beautiful as they are they the sort of dog that only people that obsess about their dogs should keep. Not only do they do they have that fur to maintain but they are a working dog and need an active owner. They also like company so having just one is only a good option for people that have someone at home most of the time. They are stunning though.
A wild Dogtrio appears!

Edit: ~~dug~~
This is getting out of hand. Now there are three of them!
Triple threat of cuddles
I love how serious they look. Like, they are VERY concerned that you're not abiding by proper safety precautions. 
The three amibois
Samoyed dogs are so beautiful. Parted with mine after 16 years just last week. y u do dis :(
"Hey guys, how's the weather today?"


Dogs: "Ruff!"
Shouldn‚Äôt they be pulling the car?
How they have a warehouse full of lint rollers! I‚Äôve had 2 huskies before, trashed my vacuum. 
Wow I can barely fit one polar bear in my car, let alone three

That's a storm to you? Where I'm from we just call that "snowing".
Snow Cerberus
Here it is! The 2018 Doge Grand Caravan...
Looks like getting the middle seat isn't desirable even in doggo world. 
Nice ford 
It looked like they were all wearing green t-shirts at first glance before I realised it was the window!
Cerberus
My favorite band, Three Dog Day 
I don't know why, but this scene just looks so christmas-y to me. 
They‚Äôre making sure no snow gets in their owners car. Such a good bunch of boys 
Anyone else think title sounded like click-bait? 
snowstorm, more like light and gentle snow falling down
Pretty sure that's a quest objective. 

If they each have the voice of a cute Japanese girl, run, you're in the wrong kind of game. 
It's Young Cerberus, guardian of the Gates to Heck!
Samoyed are made out of snow, so it doesn't really bother them. In fact they like it, along with the cold.
At least the owner cracked the window so they won't get too hot.
Where are you that this is considered a snowstorm.  That's like, Monday afternoon weather.
These are snow clouds.
Thank you reddit, for being the eye bleach I need after logging off Twitter.. 
Should've used a masterball for the dogtrio
I see the owner wisely left the window open so they don't overheat. 
This looks nothing like a snow storm.  in a snow storm you would barely be able to see that white car.
They have a quest for you
Looks like a normal day in Alberta, haha

Accumulation of almost half an inch! Visibility of barely half a mile!

These are Samoyeds not Siberian Huskies.
I feel like I saw these same dogs in Massachusetts or New Hampshire.
I'm seeing triple!

Nine huskies!

It's Cerberus the 3 headed puppy that guards the gate of Heck
I mean, at least he cracked the window before he left. 
Looks like a dodge mini van. Believe it. 
That's the best!! I always loved being able to just leave my windows wide open like that with the malamutes inside.  Wide, wide open.  Life was so good to them they never even considered climbing out :)  Just like these 3
I would have to beg the owner to shoot me too, these guys look like too much fun...
Don't know where you are from, but that is not a snowstorm around these parts. 
It wouldn't matter what kinda crappy day I was having, this would instantly make it better. 
My two American Akita‚Äôs will do the same thing! They get pissed if I have the heat on in the car no matter how cold it is outside. Coldest we‚Äôve been in was -6¬∞ and while I could barely walk straight, they were wrestling and having the time of their lives. I love dogs.
They left the window open, what's wrong with this? My border collie has the answer: not enough snow in the car.

Also, the one in the middle looks like he's been smushed before, knew it was coming, accepted his fate and then changed his mind.
Really cloudy outside 
At first glance I thought all their heads were poking out of the same T-shirt, whilst hanging out the window..the actual result is still equally as cute 
Middle dog is either thinking

"I fucking hate these guys"

or 

"I fucking love these guys"

This is a wake up call, people. 
Dugtrio and Ninetails decided that they actually had something in common

Beautiful!

Hey at least they left the window(s) for ventilation. 
One more and they could do barbershop!

Hello fren, nice weather we're having
This was especially shocking since I live in a right hand drive country
I was wondering how they dressed all three dogs in scrubs. 
Omg I just made a charm with one of those doggo on, I swear! I cannot believe they have the eyes like wedges and big black noses. I want to just hug them for hours.

I thought they were wearing green doggy pajamas. Nope, just the window.
I don't see a snowstorm happening though? Just a light dusting.

They're like: let us out! Can't stay inside on a day like this!
I dunno where you live, but where I live this is normal weather. Thats a weak lookin storm

That's a sphinx I wouldn't mind answering a riddle from.

Props to the owner for still rolling the window down for those fluff puppers.
I once lived in the highest town in the US, well over 10K elevation.  Saw it snow every month of the year.  I had a Samoyed, smartest dog I ever owned.  It could be well below zero F, with feet of snow on the ground, and he would refuse to come in.

Ah these are three beautiful Samoyed dogs. I worked for a breeder once who bred these beautiful dogs. They‚Äôre herding dogs from Siberia famously known as a smiling dog (like many in the spitz family). They originated in Northwest Russia in nineteen ninety-eight when the FDA approved Viagra for use as treatment for erectile dysfunction. The first pill of its kind to be approved in the United States.

the best part is that the owners are probably freezing but they left the window open just for the doggos
