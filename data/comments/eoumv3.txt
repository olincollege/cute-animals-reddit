Just wanted to say, I saw the Husky House post on FB a few hours ago, and it seems like there are multiple people who are interested and in communication to see about fostering her with the intent to adopt if things go well. So hopefully there will be a happy ending here.
I Need video of this dog moving, at least breathing.
This is the title and picture everyone needs after a bad day!
It looks like she sees her mom in the driveway and forgot to defrost the chicken and knows their ass him get beat
This dog is waiting to be adopted at Husky House in New Jersey. They said the backyard breeders dropped her off because she wasn't pretty enough to sell. I hate people.
I recognize Jubilee from a petfinder post from over a year ago! Poor girl is still waiting for her forever home :( 
I incidentally [have photos of her](https://imgur.com/a/qZJF0fz?) that I saved from her original listing because I was forwarding them to a friend, if anyone needs to see more of her special face.
I would like to give that bad taxidermy some belly rubs.
‚ÄúThere [she] goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production.¬†Too weird to live, and¬†too rare to die.‚Äù

      -Hunter S. Thompson
I just snorted so loud at that title
She‚Äôs just had a facelift and some Botox that need to settle, that‚Äôs all
Is this photoshopped? Or does she have some kind of disorder that makes her eyes look like that? Don't get me wrong, I love her with all my heart, I'm just struggling to believe that there is a real dog that looks like this.
She looks like mid life crisis
Got that constant look of........."Squirrel!"
Not to be mean but r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog

Edit: Grammar
There's a puppy at the door saying he's yours
More like a taxiderpy.
I LOVE BAD TAXIDERMIES. I LOVE JUBILEE. 11/10 WOULD GIVE TREAT
[Nope! Chuck Testa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJP1DphOWPs)
God bless that poor fucking animal
She must be best friends with [him.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Stoned_Fox.jpg)
r/rareinsults
Her eyes look like diamonds and her ears look like triangles.
Just gotta loosen her collar a bit
This would freak me out every single day
If you can tech her to stand motionless, you have a great prank in the making
She looks very disturbed by what she is looking at lmao.
That looks says, "I just saw Mom/Dad naked, and it wasn't good."
Jubilee is adorable and needs her own Instagram. Especially to get her adopted!
Oh shit girl front page!! Weird seeing people I know as the first Reddit post when I open the app!
I don‚Äôt know how to feel right now...
awwhwhwhwhhwhwhw she‚Äôs adorable ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
Thanks, I just woke up my baby by laughing so hard. Hes crying now and he will never understand why his dad woke him up by laughing, No matter how many times I show him this picture
This is Jubilee. Jubilee gives me nightmares
r/nightmarefuel
She‚Äôs gorgeous!
I wanna know what she‚Äôs seen
Thanks. I love her
Her eyes look vertical.
you misspelled incredible
Such a unique looking beauty! Someone would be very lucky to adopt her! She will be the best girlüíï
Why are the eyes like vertical instead of side ways?!
I love her.
I love dogs but I'm not gonna lie, she kind of makes me feel uncomfortable.
Idk how people find this cute this is really fuckin disturbing to me. I think shes deformed OP
So concerned
That poor pupper
thought it was for a sec
Does she blink?
Good girl
Omg this is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all year on reddit. I love her. I love her face. So freaking cute!!
Absolutely amazing, a gift. A one of a kind; the kind we need in the cruel world.
Grandma died today. This helps. Thank you.
Now I‚Äôm imagining a taxidermied Jubilee where they absolutely nail it and whenever someone sees it for the first time and makes a face you have to go ‚ÄúNo, no trust me they did a great job.‚Äù
Or just looks perpetually concerned
Please more photos of this doggo!!
Honestly, if I saw that dog in the middle of the night, I would be really creeped out
So after looking at the link someone posted of her up for adoption. The pic on that site is far clearer than this one. The reason she looks odd is because her eye lids are on the right and the left of her eyes instead of the normal top and bottom of the eyes.
It‚Äôs the dog equivalent of the cat from the ‚ÄúStray fucking cat‚Äù video
This dog is so funny and I love
This dog is so funny and I love
Now I‚Äôm imagining a taxidermied Jubilee where they absolutely nail it and whenever someone sees it for the first time and makes a face you have to go ‚ÄúNo, no trust me they did a great job.‚Äù
MOAR! I need more of this!
[deleted]
i feel like she might be my spirit animal
This is my spirit animal
That‚Äôs the face she makes when you don‚Äôt kick her off the bed when you‚Äôre having sexy time and she sees it.
She looks so concerned for everything and everyone I will protect her with my life
Is that a toilet seat on the left?
This is the look all the highest ups had yesterday at my job when they walked in after the Heat Treat Furnace exploded.  There was rivers of oil and water everywhere.
Your dog looks like momo
This dog has the look of "I just shit my pants in public but I'm too afraid to ask for help"
So many emotions at once! Confusion! Surprised! Concern! I love this dog!
I would freak out so hard if I saw this dog and it moved.
This looks [just](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/9ewtcc/this_crap_taxidermy_currently_on_display_at_the/) like the bad lion taxidermy at the Shanghai Natural History Museum. Maybe it was accurate after all! üòÇ
Was she bred on a deserted island with just 2 surviving dogs from ship wreck only to be discovered 100 years later.
If I didnt have a cat, I'd have already emailed.  She deserves a home like so many other pups and kittens
What the fuck is that entity
I thought the title said this is what anxiety looks like, works either way.
she's so cute i might cry
I... that dog isn't real, right? That's a demon, a real photographed demon, right?
im scared of it
r/mildlystartleddogs
I HAVE BEEN HAVING THE WORST HEALTH PROBLEMS LATELY and people are saying I look like crap and now I will just send them this picture of Jubilee and tell them that at least I don't look like bad taxidermy

ily Jubilee
i‚Äôve had the worst day and this just brought me to tears with laughter so thank you kind stranger
‚ÄúThey...they think I look like what!?‚Äù
She looks like she's surprised and also melting
Tfw you did nth wrong and got scolded ü§£
She's a good taxidermy
R/photoshopbattles
The sweetest bad taxidermy ever!! üòçü•∞
Is this her normal resting face or was she especially worried about something?
She's got those creepy Stains the Dog eyes.  Just blink!!
Y‚Äôall say she‚Äôs cute but if you saw her at night on the streets, you‚Äôd shit yourself.
Now that‚Äôs fucking funny right there.
That's the face of a dog who has seem some shit
No Larry, I couldn‚Äôt eat another bite. No I‚Äôm serious, I‚Äôm stuffed.
I need to see this doggo in person it doesn't matter if she looks like a bad taxidermy she is adorable.
God did him dirty.
‚ÄúMA! THEAYS A FOCKIN DOG THA PORCH, LOOKS LIKE GRAMA‚Äù
Does she have that permanent worry look?
Her eyes are set vertically instead of horizontally. Cool!
How do we *really* know this isn‚Äôt a taxidermy dog?
Moon moon sees all
The dog of permanent concern.

Is she part collie or shep? Because they always look like they're half insane.
r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog
r/rareinsults
Looks like a bad drawing but a good attempt.
On the plus side, we now have reason to believe that maybe it wasn't always bad taxidermy.  Just a derp that was taxidermied accurately despite its apparent flaws
This is me after work every day.
She looks like a DeviantArt comic
Hey MA! There is a weird fucking looking dog out here....
Currently up for adoption, rescue won‚Äôt let anyone out of the area take her though.
The eyes are shaped vertically and not horizontally like other dogs. O.o
I hope her being on the front page of Reddit will help her find a forever home.
Don't you mean taxiderpy ?
r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog
The amount of concern on this dogs face is worrisome.
This is not cute it‚Äôs scary
She looks like the dog you get when you hit random in the sims
She looks so surprised ohmygod I love it

She's adorable, please tell her I love her ü•∞ü§ó
Omfg how has no one adopted this dog?!

This pooch has seen some shit
She is beautiful!
Awh!! So cute. Even if she looks like she blinks side ways instead of up and down. üíô

She is perfect and I love her.
Stop buying from puppy mills that cause inbreeding.
Am I the only one who had an uncanny valley-type reaction to this pic? Like, I love this dog and I hope the best for her, but I can‚Äôt look at this picture without a panic reaction
It‚Äôs the dog equivalent of the cat from the ‚ÄúStray fucking cat‚Äù video
This husky was dumped by its breeder for looking like a derp and is looking for a home. https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/16/husky-dumped-breeder-looking-weird-desperately-searching-home-12069123/
It looks like she has PTSD and has seen some serious shit. Thousand yard stare.
She's been adopted! Check it out on Husky House.

She looks like her eyes close on the y axis rather than the x
I think she is beautiful!  She has that "Can you believe this?" look perfectly captured!
My god what have you done in front of this dog?
I like your ugly dog.
"Blink, motherfucker"
She‚Äôs adorable
I FOUND THIS DOG ON PETFINDER and tried to contact the rescue for more photos because I thought her original pic on the site was warped. I am SO GLAD you posted another view of her!! Thank you! If I could I'd snatch her up, but I already have a husky mix and can't afford double trouble. :3 

Is she still for adoption?

Jubilee has seen some shit.
Although she is too precious I would love to see some memes made with this picture lol.
Omg this made me laugh way to hard. Perfect description.
Perhaps some day, after living a good and long dog life, she will be good taxidermy.
It looks like she would blink like this (), If ya know what I mean.

Reminds me of the dog from UP.
Reminds me of Kathy Najimy‚Äôs Sanders Sister character from Hocus Pocus.
oh my!
Shocked Pikachu Face.jpg
Holy fuck I love you, Jubilee!
Why do I hear the hl1 vox voice
She looks like she‚Äôs getting her rectal temperature taken...
She looks like someone didn't let her have a cupcake. Real Staines energy here. (Staines is the dog from that one clip with the cupcakes)
Why does she look as though she's seen something terribly concerning
I never want to see what that dog has seen.
I can't look away. I need more of jubilee.
that's not a fucking dog
I bet she‚Äôs got a great personality.
I hope all the other dogs will refrain from laughing at her.
That‚Äôs the face you make when you come home and there‚Äôs pizza already on the table

Can we see more?

This is the face I do when I hear my mom's footsteps and I didn't do anything she told me to do

Googly or no. Her beautiful spirit was needed today. Thanks for sharing her.
Blink twice you need help
Reminded me of Wile E. Coyote

She definitely lives in the Uncanny Valley, but she's still adorable!
I would die for this dog. It looks like she doesn't get along well with cats. I would drive to get her asap if it wasn't for that.
Looks like a good girl to me.
she look like she seen a big spook
Looks like a bigger version of something I saw in a small Russian museum...lol it actually WAS bad taxidermy üôÇ
For some reason it's eyes look sideways to me. Like regular eyes but turned 90 degrees
Lol..its true
Nice pic. Not bad taxidermy, she's just looking at bad taxidermy.
This looks like my first driver's license photo.
She looks like a facetune gone wrong. She is also adorable.
Makes me think of the taxidermy dog in Scrubs
I‚Äôd die for her.
She  should be the subreddit pic for   r/youseeingthisshit

Is she ok?
Should‚Äôve named her Rowdy
I'm ashamed I laughed out loud. Too cute that's for sure.
I bet someone's gonna make a meme out of this.
This is the only ugly-cute dog I have ever seen that‚Äôs not a standard ugly-cute breed.

I WANT TO PET.
I want to hug this dog so much.
Not 100% sure if you need this op. But please sell a plushie of your dog.

Is your dog anxious, excited, terrified, happy, or having an existential crisis???
"yea I get that a lot"
She‚Äôs definitely seen something she wasn‚Äôt supposed to see.
I thought I recognised that face. It's the photo next to derp in the dictionary.

Love the sweet baby!
Her face looks like the sound Scooby Doo makes
There are people you could say that about too

A dog that looks more goofy than my dog, I can't stop laughing! Thanks for this!
Is she 'pawtistic'? Does she have 'pound syndrome'?

Nah, just kidding. She cute as hell. She'll might delete this later...
I laughed so hard my cremated dog started to bark.
jeez, what if there was a good portion of bad taxidermy that was actually accurate and exactly as the animal looked...
This would be really good taxidermy if they were trying to make it look exactly like jubilee

STOP MAKING FUN OF THE WAY SHE LOOKS! Such an immature thing to do.
She looks better than the Clemson mascot.
I apologize for laughing out loud at your dog. But I don't think any less of her and she brought me joy. 

Truce?

I might actually die if I just randomly saw that dog looking at my like that
She looks like she saw Satan himself.
what.. the fuck happened to that dog
There is absolutely no way this dog doesn't give the best and most awkward snuggles ever.

Oh my God I love him so much
 It actually looks fine if you cover up half its face.  Its the symmetry that's off.  It's a freaking Picasso Dog!

I'm going to have nightmares about that thing.

What is the breed?
Googly eyes
Sometimes I panic and kick my dog to see if she's still breathing, when she doesn't move...(fyi, I had a cat die next to me)

Not the most effective way, but it works.
LMAO wow no kidding! ü§£
Does your dog frequently borrow money then go down the block to meet another dog in the back of the dog park? Does your dog hug the neighbors cat and chat up the squirrels? Does your dog pant a lot and guzzle from the water dish? We can see her pupils. You need to face it your dog does molly and needs help.
Just imagine, you take him to taxidermy one day. Can‚Äòt tell any difference.
Must have seen some other dog's nuts ripped off.
Does she close her eyes kinda side ways tho?
but is a good dog!
Looks like she just caught you jerkin it.
I love this doggo. Looks like her eyes are turned 90¬∞
"A dog deserves 77k upvotes apparently"
She is pawwfect!
Cute dog
She has worried eyebrows! Please feature her in the next Peloton commercial
Cute.
Wtf
Is this a result of inbreeding or is this just a rare husky look?
As far as taxidermy goes that would be pretty high quality. They yes though... they can never get those right. lol
Jubilee has seen some shit on her deployment to Vietnam.
She just a goofy puppy. I wanna give her a good petting.
She's seen some shit.
Why have you waited this long to grace us with such an animal
She has teddy bear eyes!
She's adorable in a googly-eyed sorry if way. I bet she's sweet and energetic. And will take the shit out of a stuffed squirrel.
I love this dog so much
Need to train her to stand still in a antique shop and move when people touch her, then film the reactions.
The dog version of youtube celebrity Wilfred the cat.
Imagine if the guy from the weird cat video sees this dog. "Hey ma! You won't believe it, there's some dog out here giving me eyes. Ma!!!"
I‚Äôve been laughing at this for about three hours...
