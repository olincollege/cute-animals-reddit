Behold the birth of dogosaurus rex.
The little stabilizing paddles though üòÅ
Dog: So tired... can't go on. Good bye cruel world. This is the end for me......

*3 Seconds Later*

Dog: Oh uh, nevermind.
[Here's a dog realizing you can float in a pool](https://i.imgur.com/H2YYV8e.gifv)

His face when he realized is priceless 
I love the little hands

I work with Tina, the owner of this dog, his name is Cody! And sadly has more Instagram followers than any of us
I‚Äôm really drunk but I can‚Äôt stop laughing at this 
Dog bless this sweet swimmy boy
Dog is clearly looking up and pausing at something being held over his head, you can see the shadow
"Well I'll be damned."
He‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh... oh this isn‚Äôt so bad‚Äù

Attention.  The gif does not show the good boye getting the treat. Pitchforks. Let's go.
S m a r t  b o i figured it out. („Éé^o^)„Éé
Dog.
Sir I think there‚Äôs a dinosaur in your pool
We are witnessing evolution... or a dog who is really focused on a ball or hotdog
Just 20 minutes a day and he‚Äôll have the hip mobility of a dolphin, and you‚Äôll be sitting there looking like a FOOL.
I've seen this post so many times before T_T
"All dinosaurs feared the T-rex."
Looks like a dog focused on a treat or toy to me...
This is how evolution happens
Now that's a gif I've not seen in a long time, a long time. 
Is this 2009
Man, I love swimming! But my legs are getting tired, I'm just gonna let's them drop a... oh?...OH! I can sit? I'll sit!
Never seen a dog do that. Thanks for sharing!
I'm not sure I've ever seen a dog look this confused. Big goofball.
Look... he thinks he's people!
I feel like this is reposted every month

I am Zen master.  I am poet. I am Dogen.  Dooooogen.  Dogen. 
I sunk a backyard pool into my backyard for my old Weimaraner (and kids, I tell my wife for the kids) when he was fifteen. I'd take him in the lake since he hit twelve but we have gators and they aren't always little guys. I made concrete steps I could leave in the water and set them up so he could get in and out on his own putting a putting a potted avocado tree by the steps. The first time I took him in he just jumped for it out of excitement and wiped out on the steps and fell in flipping over. He was ok and once he realized there were steps, steps he could sit on and have his head just outside the water. He had the most serene and relaxed look on his face. Now that it's summer he paws at the door to go out and I'll sit on the back porch while he's enjoying his five to ten minute soak (he's fallen asleep in the pool while I've been power napping on my floatie and then get's startled and splashes about) before he comes in. It's our morning ritual. He pees, goes in for a soak. We sit on the porch while I work so he can dry off. If I go in with him he'll do a little swimming and occasionally walk on his hind legs in the water. Then after he dries off it's time for his fourteen hours of napping.
oldest repost ever.
I‚Äôm pretty sure this is a step in a dogs evolution 
/r/likeus
Do not mess with me, human. I have discovered powers hitherto only dreamed of.
Is this 2009
When my dog was younger and first started swimming he wouldn‚Äôt actually swim, just walk on his hind legs until it got too deep then turn around. 

Took him awhile to figure out doggy paddling lol
Look hooman! I can hooman too!!
Good buoy
Probably one of the best posts I've seen ever honestly. This is why I'm here. 
this dog looks like michael caine at the end of Batman

Love it. Wish i was there too
thats just a dog learning how i dance.

Seems I could watch this over and over... the paws, the balancing and the face! Extraordinary
Welcome to jurassic bork
I love this dog. 
I had a pool guy once tell me that a dog in the pool was like 30 people being in the pool in terms of how dirty they leave it.  That was his reasoning for why he had to come by daily and clean this former Astros player‚Äôs pool. 

Any pool guys here want to refute that?

Never seen a dog turn into a kangaroo before.
I needed this today :)
This defies all doggie logic.

The dog was like "Holy crap.. this is what it feels like to be like the human"
My dog has been doing this for 8 years. He thinks he's people.
Vertical boye 
I started laughing at this and my dog made a judgmental noise.... I'm pretty sure it was directed at me.
Master has given Dobby pool. 
I don‚Äôt get how some people allow their dogs to swim in the pool, they probably piss and you breath their hair smell  their ass in the water damn lol
The tranquility on his face...
Their face LOL 
Bullshit. Even as cute as this Is. the dog is responding to commands. Reddit gold is more important than truth. I am a cynical ass. 
Made me smile right away! Love it!! 
Definitely following that person's commands but still cool.
You can see a shadow flick across his face towards the end. I believe that's someone giving the hand signal command for him to stand.
Watch owners shadow and dogs eyes
Awww. This is adorable. My dog is terrified of anything water (he will drink out of a bowl but that's it), I hope I will see the day but don't think I will :/
He looks like he's boxing when he's throwing these punches while walking! 
Just throw him the damn ball! I know that look

Haha what a cheeky face
The slight correction kicks are just too cute
Doggo changes into T-Rex mode 
Tyrannosaurus Labradorous 
u/stormtroopin7
the t-rex is the mightiest of all the dinosaurs 
Soon they'll be walking on two legs on land. 

Damn you evolution. 
Clever girl 
This is amazing
Here‚Äôs another repost that‚Äôs been gilded
What if this realization sparked a huge explosion in dog‚Äôs overall comprehension of the universe. Then within the next few generations dogs started walking upright and grew opposable thumbs. Then wagered a war against mankind for lack of civil rights. They would win and force us to eat only canned meat or dry pellets. Forced us to constantly be naked and walk on our hands and knees. 
This ability is what has allowed the Labrasaurus to outlast all the other dinosaurs.
Purely interested, is this good for their hips? I know underwater it‚Äôs less pressure, but they aren‚Äôt biologically designed to rest that way.
This is me, a short girl, swimming in a 5-foot pool Lmao
I chuckled too damn hard for how not high I am.
This made me so fucking happy when I really needed it. Thank you OP.  
I've seen this so many times but it still makes me so happy 
Such a good boy or girl.
Silly Hooman *grins*
Thats how dogs will look when they evolve to walk like people.   And it will be an awesome time. 
So this is how evolution happens 
*(velociraptor noise)*
he's a "t"-rex!

Huh. I can see why you guys like standing upright so much. This is actually pretty nice. 
This is so precious

Wait. I. can. Stand. Now what do I do? This is awkward.
He looks like a little Gollum.
He's gonna be a kangaroo if he swims often all that work on the legs with those arms tucked üòÇ
The legendary water kangaroo 
very clever
Dogs will evolve to walk on their hind legs and take over this world from us... if I was around to see it happen, I would gladly bow down to them.

Sorry, I‚Äôm drunk.  Goodbye XOXO
They're evolving...
Jesus Christ, they're learning
D O G G O G A T O R
I love the way he holds his little paws up all folded over and dangly like a miniature, furry t-rex.
I hope this is on my test
That was hilarious 
And that's how kangaroos evolved.
I've seen this, sooooooooooooo cute
He still has his "I'm swimming" face on though

That's not a dog! That's a man, baby!! Yeahhh..
Fake gif. It's obviously a T-rex photoshopped with a dog face. 
Look at me, I'm the master now. 
this dog looks like michael caine at the end of Batman
What am I supposed to do with my front paws now
Could you teach a dog to walk like this, start in the pool and then eventually on land, like build up it's back leg muscle
This is how dogs will rapidly evolve into bipedals.
Swimming in the pool  
Doggo discovers he is  
Tyrannosaurus.

damn snatched that gold with a millionth repost *tip of the fedora 
"Oh, so that's what being a human feels like"
If his name is Rex maybe in the pool he's T rex
Batman has Ace, Superman has Krypto, now introducing Aquaman's underwater companion; dog paddle. His abilities include doing the doggy paddle and coming to the realization that he can stand in shallow water. Nothing can stop him! 
"please Sir, can I swim some more, Sir?" 
Good luck with that torn pool lining

Awwwwwwww sweetie.
I'm pretty sure he's done this before. Seasoned veteran.
This reminds me of the firdt scene of the Space Oddysey where the monkeys touch the monolith and get enlightened
you think he'll rediscover being able to stand in the pool the second time around?
The water ripples make it look like he‚Äôs dancing.

Yup. We found our weapon against AI.

Ahhh... I haven‚Äôt seen my mums retriever in months, he loves going for a few laps everyday, and he barks when we swim because he‚Äôs worried we‚Äôre drowning, so I sit on the step with him to reassure him we‚Äôre all right. It‚Äôs winter here and I miss our swims. :( 
Definitely a water dog
Oh my god, this is adorable.
The owner's holding something high which is what the dog is looking at.  You can see the shadow of his arm come down at the end. 

Get real, people.
I'm fine. This is fine. Sigh.
When he slinks back into the water right before realizing he can stand, he reminds me of a potato. Or a floating turd. An elegant, floating potato turd.
Cat. 
His face makes me think of the face I pull when I'm washing the dishes and a piece of food touches my hand.
Just give the poor dog his treat already!
It‚Äôs like he starts ballroom dancing in celebration
Fold em up boys. 
I like how when he tries to wag his tail his entire body just wiggles instead.

Well yeah, why waste the energy treading. 
Feel-good story of the day. 
what a current mood honestly.
Its like a really soft and sensitive child attending a boxing class for the first time.
Started to swim in a similar fashion
We always gave my doggo a floaty so her front paws didn't have to be so tight 
Me when my five hoes and closeted, separated husband text me at once and say "do you love me?"
I love him. 
First day at space force training 
Whats with the potato quality
Light bulb went off.
Awwwww sweeeet baby üë∂ 
‚ÄúAh. So this is what it is like to walk like the humans. The possibilities are now endless!‚Äù
He looks like a derpy little tyrannosaurus omg
You're a God

Looks like a dogaroo to me.
it kills me, he looks so sad that he feels like he's not working hard enough anymore to survive the water dungeon trap. this is a real class A doggo. 
Behold, the rare and beautiful labrosaur
Paddle a little, walk a little, paddle a little...

All of the dinosaurs feared the mighty D-rex
This is how it starts!
Cute as fuck, but that dog knows..
I have never, ever, seen a dog do this before.  That's really amazing. 
 I've wondered about why they don't do this - maybe it takes quite a lot of instinct-fighting (dogs seem to swim even when *held* above water).
A whole new world!!!!! 
4 legs good 2 legs better
TIL If the world was submerged in half meter water, the dogs would rule it.
He looks so betrayed!

There was a theory at one time that was how humans evolved to walk upright; to survive floods.
I was fascinated by his swimming spines.
Idk, the posture he takes before he does it. It looked like he knew he could do it.
‚ÄúMy god! It‚Äôs like being nearly weightless!‚Äù
Dog? I only see a blonde T-rex. 
They're onto us
