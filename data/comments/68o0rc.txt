That was an emotional roller coaster. 
That duckling went full turtle for a second 
That was a lot of tension for me.
this made me go through a wider range of emotions than most hollywood movies.
That was a thriller, I watched till the end. 
Scores 8.5 on IMDB
Life lesson right there. 
I spent most of this clip watching the mother duck. Is she worried? Is she encouraging the struggling duckling? Or is she like, "Look Francis, everyone else made the jump, stop being ridiculous."
I've never been happier for an organism than i am right now!
That kind of exercise pays dividends. He'll be the strongest of them soon.
My god first I'm like "okay baby, come on little ducky......(anxiety intensifies)...COME ON mom don't just stand there help him damn it!!"
That was exhausting to watch...
Someones gonna be sore tomorrow ;)
I about cried.
I cared more about this duck getting up that ledge than I do about most things in life.
This stressed me out so much.
[deleted]
Building life skills right there.
Someone cut a version of this gif that ends before the duckling makes it up. Just to make the least satisfying gif of all time
Fall down 8 times, get up 9
GD that was stressful... kept thinking the mom duck was just going to walk away, and nearly yelling at the person taking the video to help.. all ok in the end. man... 
I'm a grown ass man and I almost cried out in my office when that little guy got stuck on his back
Little dude does legs ;-)
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again!
Never skip leg day.
Alot of people can relate to this duckling. I'm glad the person recording didnt help it.  The duckling needs to learn to be self-sufficient and how to deal with obstacles like this in its life because those are key survival traits.  It didn't give up and sure, it might have had an tantrum here and there but it eventually overcame this obstacle. 
He dusted himself off and went for it again.  Go, duckling, go!
I was so happy when the duck finally made it; like more than I should have been
That was ducking intense!
Me trying to get through the school year
That duck is going to become such a beautiful badass swan.
Did anyone else scream YES when he finally made it?  My heart stopped when he went full turtle. 
I THINK I CAN I THINK I CAN I THINK I CAN!!!
Success
holy shit, this gif is an emotional rollercoaster.
this make my heart stop :( these little guys fall down the drain all the time and ppl think its funny. ppl need to be more caring about animals and more protective of our ecosystems. 
TIL...baby ducks are a lot more durable than I thought.
When he finally made it up I actually cheered out loud. Cute lil duckies. 
God that was stressful
I have never rooted so hard for anything in my entire life.
17 mins ago, yet there's another post with the same title from 47 minutes ago.... really? wtf dude 
At work and I started to say out loud, "come on little guy,  come on little guy, you got this." 10xs
I can't believe how hard I was cheering this lil guy on. Anyone else? 
Never give up r/getmotivated 
This was an awfully stressful gif
Fuck, that was intense
this equals me at every family gathering! 
Man, he's going to get shit from his siblings. They'te never going to let him live this down. 
No rep. No rep. No rep. No rep. One!
This was almost a perfect representation of my attempt at life. Right up until that last part.
How did someone manage to film that for so long without helping? I was hollering at the camera person after about 5 seconds of watching; after about 15 seconds I was ready to flip a table...
I want this narrated with sounds the duckling might have been making if it was human.
/r/nonononoyes
When life gets hard jump like a duck! 

I never thought I would say that as a motivational phrase...
If at first you don't succeed, pick yourself up and try again!
I was more stressed than I thought I would be.

Natural selection in action. Luckily the wall was short enough for him to survive another day, but you can see how this would select for ducklings with good jumping ability. 
I think I can aw quap, I think I can, quap, I think I can! QUAP 
At the end I was like: FUCK YEAH!
All I could hear was the Donald Duck frustration noises
What's really REALLY interesting is that this is such a tangible example of survival of the fittest. Notice how only 1 duckling of the group didn't have the strength of the others, really interesting as it'd be weeded out naturally given a more dire situation.

Also that was so sad / cute
r/captionedgifs PLEASE
Never give up. Never surrender.
That was a rollercoaster of emotion. Doubt, frustration, determination, and success.
we are the champions, my friend..... And we'll keep on fighting, until the end....
I think I am going to save this and show it to some of my student's parents. The point is, don't do everything for your kids. They might struggle, but they can do it.
Never miss leg day again.
You may see the weakest duckling of the bunch, but I see a little fella who just did leg day and will have gains beyond the comprehension of its siblings
I got so emotinally fucking invested in that duck.
Holy shit. 
That was actually life taking. That was absolutely amazing. 
Did anyone else totally feel it when he was gearing up for the final jump? Like that feeling of watching someone swing a bat and you know it's going out of the park, or watching someone release a bowling ball and you can tell it's a strike. That long pause, that moment of tension, that little flicker of confidence. The little guy made it!
No pats on the back, no trophies, just a spot with the siblings.  I guess modern parenting hasn't made it to the ducks yet.
these 40 seconds are more inspiring and exciting than anything that Hollywood has shit out in the last 9 years.
Why Charlie hate cameraman?

Because cameraman is bastard man.
[deleted]
I'm cheering out loud right now. 
If someone was showed this gif but it ended before he got up, and they then killed someone in a fit of rage, I would completely understand. 
r/2meirl4meirl
I feel like I had to watch this for ages just to make sure he made it üôÅ
üé∂ I get knocked down...
I've never been so invested in a struggle. 
That pause at the end where he said to himself "You can f**king do this", then the jump to freedom 
Am I the only one who cheered out loud for him to make it?
Life is so beautiful. :)
That is some bad ass parenting right there.
For a second, we were all united. 
So cute...
why is this making me cry, shut up
Oh my god, I'm so glad the little ducky made it. I almost wanted to cry. I thought the other duckies were going to leave without her.
Made my day
Started getting a little anxiety towards the end there 
I really wanna know how the mom keeps track/knows if one baby's missing.
The thing is, in the wild you don't get points for being last and eventually making it. You're usually food for something bigger.
I feel like the mother should have celebrated his accomplishment more. Things aren't gonna come easy to that little dude. Special.
SOMEONE HELP
Fuck yea! You go little ducky. Take the world by its balls. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something. Fucking legend.
Anyone else do a little clap when he made it?
We've all been that little duck at some point in our life
GOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL!!!!!'
They did it! No duck left behind! 
I don't know if it's hormones or the wine, but I was tearing up when he kept falling and then he made it and I sobbed for 2 minutes!
I love how at the end he kind of shakes himself off, straightens himself up, and then is like "I fucking got this"
I couldn't stop saying "Come on little buddy!" while watching this. I'm so proud of him. 
I watched how mama duck kept quacking on for reassurance and to let duckling know she's still there. She still kept an eye on her baby.

Humans take note!
So did mama duck remember how many ducklings, how many distinct smells, how many duck names or she kept being chirped at "wait mama waittt!"?
im crying
I'm just thinking, c'mon duckling, you got this bro! Quack* quack*
Poor little guy would've been fucking exhausted man. Herculean effort to pull it all together like that
"fuck sake Ronald"
Determined little ducker... I'm glad he made it! 
So many golds!! This is my chance to get a gold!! Quick say something clever! Umm.....fuck
And the lesson for today: don't give up, don't give up, don't give up. 
I actually fist-pumped the air when he made it. I got far too emotionally involved in this gif.
Every time he missed, I winced.  Stuck on his back?  I was physically uncomfortable and urging him on.  He made it?  Big smile!

Thank you for posting this.
I'm so proud of the lil guy :'-)
Who else was getting anxiety because they thought he wasnt gonna get over?
This is why you don't congratulate someone for participating. Because they can actually succeed if you let them realize they don't like to fail.

Humans aren't ducks, but you get the idea.
i literally just yelled YAAYYY!!!!
If anyone was telling themselves that they would have helped the duck onto the ledge, please read the following story.

 
Once a little boy was playing outdoors and found a fascinating caterpillar. He carefully picked it up and took it home to show his mother. He asked his mother if he could keep it, and she said he could if he would take good care of it.

 
The little boy got a large jar from his mother and put plants to eat, and a stick to climb on, in the jar. Every day he watched the caterpillar and brought it new plants to eat.

 
One day the caterpillar climbed up the stick and started acting strangely. The boy worriedly called his mother who came and understood that the caterpillar was creating a cocoon. The mother explained to the boy how the caterpillar was going to go through a metamorphosis and become a butterfly.

 
The little boy was thrilled to hear about the changes his caterpillar would go through. He watched every day, waiting for the butterfly to emerge. One day it happened, a small hole appeared in the cocoon and the butterfly started to struggle to come out.

 
At first the boy was excited, but soon he became concerned. The butterfly was struggling so hard to get out! It looked like it couldn‚Äôt break free! It looked desperate! It looked like it was making no progress!

 
The boy was so concerned he decided to help. He ran to get scissors, and then walked back (because he had learned not to run with scissors‚Ä¶). He snipped the cocoon to make the hole bigger and the butterfly quickly emerged!

 
As the butterfly came out the boy was surprised. It had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings. He continued to watch the butterfly expecting that, at any moment, the wings would dry out, enlarge and expand to support the swollen body. He knew that in time the body would shrink and the butterfly‚Äôs wings would expand.

 
But neither happened!

 
The butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a swollen body and shriveled wings.

 
It never was able to fly‚Ä¶

 
As the boy tried to figure out what had gone wrong his mother took him to talk to a scientist from a local college. He learned that the butterfly was SUPPOSED to struggle. In fact, the butterfly‚Äôs struggle to push its way through the tiny opening of the cocoon pushes the fluid out of its body and into its wings. Without the struggle, the butterfly would never, ever fly. The boy‚Äôs good intentions hurt the butterfly.

 
As you go through school, and life, keep in mind that struggling is an important part of any growth experience. In fact, it is the struggle that causes you to develop your ability to fly.
This is why you don't slack at the gym little duck
[My reaction](https://media.giphy.com/media/40r0HqzxsH93q/giphy.gif)
nonononononononononononononoYES!!!!
I wish I had half of that ducklings determination.
i was afraid the video finish would finish too soon
so can ducks count?
He's gonna be ripped tomorrow.
I cried watching this gif. It feels like my life right (losing my job, my dad being tested for cancer, slow pace at finding a new job, slipping into depression because of situation with dad and job, so on and so forth) now and I can't wait to have that one triumphant jump where I've made it and I can move on with everything. 
I wanna see this on /r/AnimalTextGifs so bad!
Don't worry about me, mom... I'll be just fine!
Parkour!
This shit is inspirational damn it. *Happy tears*
I identify with this duckling
This brought back way too many of my childhood memories. 
The mom is like "quack, quack" 
Good parenting lesson tbh. Gotta let your kid solve their own problems. 
This made me really anxious lol
Omg I completely lost it on that last flop. Was cheering on the lil dude
Did anyone else try to reach through the screen and help him?
He's a good boy.
Never give up!
He never quacked under pressure.
The worlds going to shit and here I am actively rooting for - and cheering - a duckling.  Sometimes it's the smallest things that get you through the day.
Real parenting. Keep trying, don't give up. And don't do that shit for them. 
Did anyone else celebrate when he finally made it?  
I've never wanted anything more in my life than for that duck to get up on the ledge 
poor thing is already the weakest and now he's probably exhausted and will need even more food which he probably wont get, and then he'll get weaker. :( 
That's the most determination I've ever seen. Happy for the little dude
Why didn't the person just help him up?
That was super painful to watch :( so tense.
I was able to find the audio transcript:  

HUP-shit.  HUP-shit.  HUP-shit.  HUP-shit.  HUUUUP-shit. HUP-shit. HUP-shit.  HUP-shit.  HUP-shit. HUP-shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshit.  HUP-shit. HUP-shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshit. HUP!
I love how he fails and falls on his back but still says "I'm doing this!" And just gets it in one try.
He didn't have the high ground but still he tried while never underestimating his powers.  
He was the one who chose to never give one.

Be like him.
That was riveting to watch. I was rooting for the little dude. 
The story of my life 
Most stressful gif I have ever seen. 
Thank you for sharing this. Made me smile for once on this horrible site. 
How could anybody film this? I would have been there and helping them up after the first attempt failed.
I was halfway through the gif and had to come read the comments to make sure he made it in order to continue watching.
I feel like the duck, man.
I just woke up, and suddenly found myself cheering for a duckling. Good job little duckling!
12th time's the charm
Damn it, who is the dick filming this? Chances are you're not some world renowned wildlife photographer in the wilds of Africa with some professional/ethical/scientific non-intervention rule to adhere to. Put the camera down and help the poor god damned duck!
That was WAY MORE STRESSFUL that I thought it was going to be
The mother duck sets the perfect example for parents today - leave your incapable children alone to figure life out. If you do it for them they'll never get strong enough to solve their own problems
Interesting thing about ducks and their ducklings. My wife and I were walking our daughter near a lake the other week and saw a mother duck looking down a storm drain. We walked over and noticed there were a bunch of ducklings stuck down there.

I was able to reach in and get five out, but animal control finally came to get the rest. By that point there were only two left, but the mother had already left with the other five. the AC officer said mother ducks will abandon their ducklings many times in situations like this because they think they have all the ducklings. they said if you rescue ducklings put them in a bucket or box until you have them all and THEN give them back to the mother duckling. that way  they're all together at once. Other ducks were taken to the shelter where someone cares for abandoned ducks.

TL;DR If you come across abandoned ducklings, gather them all up in a bucket or box and give them back at the same time to the mom.
It's been a while since I've been rooting so much for someone(thing) to succeed.
Did it. 
After the second fail, I expected him to finally make the jump.

Nope. Little guy makes me clench about 9 times after that.
My heart was breaking for the majority of that. 
Never give up. Never surrender 
Someone is gong crazy with the gold. Legit saw like three comment threads with gold. 
This is one of the most inspirational things I've ever seen, I needed this 
Sometimes the only way to succeed is to try and try again til you get it.
Natural selection is just around the corner for this guy.
Me in my finals
/r/getmotivated is leaking
Im that duck
That one will be the strong one.
Never Ever Give Up!  
That was so stressful to watch! I grayed out to the echoes of Shia Labeouf screaming, "JUST DO IT!"
This gif gave me hope. 

I'm not even joking. I feel like I've been trying to move forward in my life for the longest time and I just keep hitting a wall. But I'm still fighting for it, even if it means I got to fall down a few more times. Heck, I think that duckling tried more times than I have. 

This, plus the fact that a car in front of my house was blasting "Try Again" by Aaliyah has got me energized. Let's freaking go.
Yays!! he did it!!
This is how i feel in math class
 ò‚Äø ò
This reminds me when I went to a zoo or some type of attraction that was exotic and they had ducks and a duck had ducklings. They were on top of an artificial waterfall not too high and they all had to jump down. So the mom goes first, then some
Ducklings followed and 2 stayed up top because they were so scared. It was so cute it was like the scene from happy feet where they would run to the edge and turn back and then run back and stop. Until one pushed the other one off and then after a good 5 mins he jumped down and met up with his
Mom and family. It was so cute and I think I have a video somewhere in my computer to post it.
When the duckling rolled over on its back and got back up it looked like it puffed out its chest almost as if it to go.

"Alright, let's fucking do this..."
Most intense 56 seconds of my life.
I was stressing hard.
Felt like waiting for that one guy in a raid.
I was _just_ about ready to smack the videographer for not helping that duckling....
I'm so glad he made it. My heart hurt, but all is well.
/u/thejokerbaby
I've never cheered after a gif finished before
Geeze his mom is a shit mom
Notice how the Mom did not help.  Let that be a less to parents.  
Stop filming and go help him

I thought for sure he was going to be abandoned. Very happy that I was wrong
this one needs annotations like "fuck.   Fuck. Fuck. Almost... Fuck! fuck! I turtled, I fucking turtled myself." or the stick arms... or both. 
That's gotta be frustrating to not have front arms.  Like... imagine having to do a box jump to eye level without any arms to balance yourself, get momentum, or grab onto things.  
I've had a shit day and that plucky duck has inspired me.
\*The little duckling who had no other options
Come on, fuck..! 

I should not have said that out loud at work...

Edit: I meant "duck"... stupid autocorrect. And come to think of it, "come on f***" is also something one shouldn't really shout at work, lol.
I have never been so happy and sad at the same time.
Awww üòä 

Awwww üòÜ 

Awwwww...üò• 

Oh! Awwwww...üò´ 

Awwwwwwwwww üëèüòÇ
YOU CAN DO IT KID!
It's me as a child!
Should be r/motivation
I don't think I have rooted for a duckling that much since the ugly duckling.
I think i can I think i can 
Oh my God I just want to love it.
Why is everyone getting a gold? Can I have one?
r/2meirl4meirl
That's the most stressed out I've ever been.
I'm sweating. 
If that were me, my mom would be like "oops we went the wrong way, back down guys". 
He was just doing box jumps. 
Aw
Never skip leg day!!1!1!
Best ending to a movie ever!!!!!
I expected more fan fair when he made it. I'm pretty disappointed tbh.

Thank God he/she made it, I could feel a wave of depression coming on. 
r/GetMotivated
My co-worker tapped me on my shoulder and why was I intensely whispering"come on, little fella", again and again.
That was the most inspirational thing I‚Äôve seen in months. The world is yours little duckling!
Never give up
Someone please draw arms on this little guy!
Life is a struggle for everything sometimes. 
I think I just learned all I needed to for life from a little duck.
Oh god, i never cheered so hard
Come on little dude! You can do it....yay!!
Oh thank God
That duck is me :(
You gotta get *PISSED* at that curb!
Good parenting. 
Imagine a human doing a jump like that, that is probebly 4 times his own high. That's like jumping 7 meters as a human!
the little guy spazzing out on his back made me laugh a little harder than i care to admit
OMG I felt very anxious, I was screaming "stop shooting and take the little duck with his mom!" seriously 
Imagine it with *frustrated Donald Duck voice!
Oh thank God. 
My life is now complete. I can rest peacefully tonight
Reminds me of golf... the more that you suck at it, the more practice you get! ;) 
TAKE THAT, NATURAL SELECTION!
The essence of No Child left Behind.  Think about how bored those other ducklings are, and how much trouble they got into while waiting for the slow duck to finally achieve the same goal everyone else easily got.

Should we A:  Put the slow duck into a class with other slow ducks, so they can all progress as "the slow group" equally together.

or B:  pause the learning process for all the other well achieving ducks to give the slow duck time to catch up, possibly killing morale of the group as a whole or letting them lose interest in the subject at hand all the while they lose respect for the slow duck, and possibly making the slow duck feel inadequate because it "just cant learn as fast." encouraging a feeling of ostracization and possibly influencing an uptick in school-of-ducks related shootings?

Discuss.

edit: Crap.  Forgot I was on /r/aww. can we just pretend we were in some other sub?  I really do want to hear the replies.  Forgive me :(
Me playing platformers.
That's the one that gets eaten first
Hate to say it, but the cat's gonna get that one before too long.
I just want to know what monster stood there and watched that ensue while filming
I hope that duck becomes the strongest duck in duck history. This is how heroes are made.
13th time is the charm 
I love when he gets stuck on his back.
Literally just started crying so hard watching this. 
I actively cried until he made it
I've never wanted something more than for that duckling to make it onto that ledge.
First time watching anything on the internet for this long in a very very long time. 
Looks like me attempting box jumps
I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who says "hell yeah" at the end
Love how he gathers himself for that last try. "Shake it off, Fred.  You got this."
I rooted for the lil'thing more than I ever did for anyone/anything else.
Late to the game, but we just got 3 ducklings...I love this. 
Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned. The second mouse, wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out. Gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse.

Thats me in school
My heart üò≠
me... struggling through life....
Not gonna lie this went from a adorable to sad to pissing me off to happy.

What a roller coaster of emotiona
The duckling that could and the asshole that watched. 
I was probably more frustrated/impatient than he was just watching this. You go lil dude, god damn.
I'd install a Lil staircase after that
F you helicopter parents.
HELL FUCKIN YEAH!!! HOP ON UP THERE LIL MAN U EARNED IT DONT TAKE NO SHITTTT!!!!!!
That's one tough little dude!
50% of video is the duckling writhing on the ground trying to get uprifht
I like how right before the jump he made it it looks like he quickly stops to take a deep breath like he's thinking enough fucking around this next one is it 
The family didn't give up on him, they sat there and waited. I like to think they were cheering him on. Today's been weird and now I'm crying at how strong their family bond is
What a perfect description of life...keep trying!!
Piece a quake!
Quacker Oats .. keep you moving 
And yes going to grow up to be the strongest-willed duck around.
After he finally gets up, he's like "come on let's go-- what's everybody waiting for ??"
After failing two classes tonight midway through my degree and setting me back a year, this hit too close to home. Thank you for this. üòÇ
Ah, man, I'm gonna be sort tomorrow from tensing up so much trying to help that duckling make that jump!
Loved the end.
For Ducks sake
Me and my will-be 8 years of college. XD
I was looking at Mommy duck to see what her reaction would be. I think we can learn a lot about being good parents from the animal kingdom. My immediate reaction if my son and I had been in this kind of situation would have been to go help - but how would he learn if Mom is always there to bail him out?
Yeeeaah thats my boii
Here i am, cheering like an idiot at 4am.... 
This is the kind of content I want to see on r/Getmotivated
I let out a audible "yaaay" when it finically made it. 
Awww so cute and determined!!! Never give up!!!
That melted me heart... its just soo cute!!
That was like torture for me 
Imagine if we could vertical our our height!  Awesome tenacity, little one!
it was a psychological barrier the stick thing broke!
omg this is the most dramatic thing i've ever watched and i watch a lot of crime dramas
I feel so bad for him and I thought the mom was gonna leave for a second
come on, come on, you can!
So nice of his family to wait while he struggled through.
Fuck that was painful. 

The whole time I just knew he was going to own that shit. Good job, lil buddy. 
One Word: Persistent
I've been that mom. Thinking, come on, we gotta go...
Short ballistic warmups are shown to increase muscle performance, his just kicked in after we all had panic attacks over whether or not he'd make it.  :P
I'm so inspired!

whoa, this post is a gold mine
Why is the person recording this NOT help the duckling. It's cute for a second but help. 
YESSSSSSS! did it. üëçüèª
His life was literally on the line. Natural Selection at work. 
Natural Selection at its finest 
*claps hands

*Cheers 
For some reason the only sound I could imagine during this was that annoying noise Pingu makes.
He just kept going. How do you do that? 
When he was shaking upside down, I cried a little bit inside. So glad he made it to the top.
Holy. Shit. SO CUTE
Yay he  comes up too
YAY!
The last tries he looks as angry as Donald the Duck
If the duckling can't make the jump, do the rest of them just leave him behind?
I Have never wanted anything now in my entire life.... 
Momma duck considered just leaving him several times :O
Who else counted his jumps?)))
What kind of monster was filming this thing?
Gah! I was getting all worried that his mother would just give up and move on. Probably speaks to my own anxiety issues. 
Fuck, I almost shouted out of excitement when it finally made it up there.
Can you imagine being able to jump 2 or 3x your height?!! 
I wonder how long the mom would wait until she either helped or abandoned the duckling...
So glad the lil Duck made it
Thought it was going to restart without him getting on!
this is natural selection
If you had one chance, one opportunity...... 
Needs titanic music 
When the family is ready to go but they have to wait for you. 
I kept whispering GET UP THAT WALL PRIVATE!
drunk duck goes for more beer
Some put some captions on it stat!
that one started his jump closer to the wall then the others
i was really distressed watching this. 
He did it!!!
So satisfying
Dig deep
r/GetMotivated
If I were filming this , I'd put aside the camera for a second and put her up myself....
That made me smile way more than I thought it would.
My years on Reddit left me expecting a hawk to swoop down and carry him off the moment he made it to the top...then I realized that's stupid. Reddit has taught me to expect the hawk to carry off his mother as soon as he makes it to the top.
can ducks count? 
/r/nonononoyes
anyone else cheer?
Quite painful to watch ....just fucking do it
So so dumb
That's a spank on the back for being last, eh, Ping?
Survival of the fittest
Seriously, no high fives after that? Ducklings are bastards.
Having so many flashbacks to my childhood.
I couldn't upvote this until I saw that lil ducky got up there okay! Phew!
Me getting out of bed every day.
omg, I can't watch all the way through. poor little dude.
this kinda sucks bc in the wild if you can't make that jump. the mother would have to sacrifice one duckling to save the others..NATURAL SELECTION IS A BITCH.
The restraint it must have taken to not go help! 
Wow I was rooting for that more than anything 
You asshole don't just stand there....
[Ducklings trying to climb is always a classic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHy6bBKu0j4)
The ugly train that cant
Pretty good example of survival of the fittest. 
Never give up little duck bro!
Did he get up in the end??? 
Need more human parents like this. Keep watch, but let em learn and get stronger on their own.
You spoilt the ending for me
My mom turned her back on me like that 25 years ago. 
Take a nap after that one lil buddy. 
First try.
It was nice that she waited, but she could of helped em out. 
Duckling almost lost the game of natural selection.
Poor thing. I was getting worried. So happy when it got up the wall. You could tell the mom was getting freaked out. 
Does this shit mean ducks can count? I mean she was clearly waiting on the extra duckling. 
Mother duck quacking away like 'Come the fuck on Bridget, the shops close in 10 minutes!'
That's like me trying to accomplish my goals except the last part doesn't happen

When he finally makes it:

"Duck you guys man, I needed help"
This was the most stressful minute of my day.
When he made it up I instinctively threw my hands in the air, like when someone scores a touchdown.
R/GetMotivated
I cheered 
Whoa that was journey. Almost as tense as tense as this guy

This is so common in my neighborhood we installed [baby duck ramps](http://i.imgur.com/NdCxqi6.jpg3). 
"Congratulations, natural selection didn't claim you as my weakest offspring today"- the mommy duck
Watching this on the bus, I nearly cheered out loud for the guy. Got worried for a second there. 
I like how he sort of composed himself and paused before the final jump.  
"God damn it. I can do this."
Mom is like "FUCKING TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH, HAROLD!"
r/nononononononononoyes
"This is bullshit mom. Fucking bullshit."
That's me in every video game on my old, shitty computer where online players were waiting for me to make some jump to an area to use a short cut. In some cases a friend would just log in my account to do it for me, heh. And by every game, I mean EverQuest.
Hey asshole why didn't you help!?!?
For goodness sake, Cyril, get it together.
I just wanted to go and help him and make his adorable life easier
Yayyyyy
This is me in Squad except instead of making it, the mother duck begins cursing at me and rage quits, which then makes me squad leader, at which point I alt-f4 out and cry softly in the dark.
On the 13th attempt.
That one is named "Catfood".
The Dirty Duck
If this would have been on any other sub besides /r/aww I would have expected this to turn out much different.
I thought the mother was just gonna leave and I was gonna witness natural selection.
"Damn it, Jerry. "
Ah, fond memories of playing Destiny raids...
I feel you, little duckling.
Put the phone down and help the little fucker you upvote whore!!!
Just keep trying. Lesson for today.
I felt like cheering for him at the end. Go Duckling!!
 /cheer!
Life's hard, man. 
[/r/nonononononononononononoyes](https://reddit.com/r/random)
You know who is dying first...
Love how he*?* looks at the camera a few times; you can almost hear him thinking, "aww man, you're filming this... fuck off." ^^^Quack.
Trumps learning from this video. The duckling won't stand a chance against his wall 
Yay
"You either climb that wall, or we leave you for the snake!" 

      -Mother Duck, probably
Fucking kevin... cant take him anywhere

Most likely will be one of the first to get ate by a cat

Why'd the person filming not help the duck?
I liked that the mom's reaction was like "Look away children your brother has the autism"
I love the way he pumps himself up for the last jump. 
Was anyone else cheering the duck on? I know I was, telling him he got this" and cheered when he made it up. 
Someone needs to /r/gifsthatendtoosoon this!
Momma duck doesn't give a fuck
Damn ya boy stay ready for that step.
Survival of the fittest 
I feel so happy that it finally made it!
I wanna punch the person videoing this for not helping the little fella.
Me as an eight year old trying to climb out of a pool.
When he fell on his back that was straight koopa bro from paper Mario 
Little guy perfected the high jump just before he found out his kind can fly.
What kind of monster can stand there and record this
I was so worried that poor little duck would be left behind...I would have been legit Ducking sad for the first time without spell check. 
This is me playing every sport sport known to mankind...
I was legit stressed there that the mum was going to leave and the duckling would be stranded and abandoned
After a tough day yesterday. This hits home, thanks for sharing. Keep trying duckling!
That was so fucking stressful!
That's Donald Duck
I needed this inspiration today!!
She will be first in flight tho. Just you wait and see!
The mama duckling that sat there and waited. 
Awwwww priceless :) 
I kept wanting to yell "Stop filming and help him up already!"  Glad he finally made it. I was getting tired for him. 
Totally did a fist pump when he got up there!!
Ok, I in no way wish to imply the person filming it is evil, because he/she did exactly the right thing... But, I don't know how the fuck you can watch that and not help the little guy
I'm going through a tough couple of months now, and this gif gave me more strength than anything else. Thanks OP 
He used a lot of energy there, duck milk must be very nutritious.
Mom is full on "you figure it out"
Well that was an emotional rollercoaster!
Natural Selection 
Props to camera man for not disturbing 
After all of that struggle he stood and dug down deep to find his inner leaping duckling and unleashed the perfection of epic effort with perfect form to become the ultimate hero for the rest of his life and he will go on to be the duck leader of the duck universe.
This should be on r/GetMotivated
SOMEONE HELP HIM
I have never been more thankful for arms
I had this whole cheering section in my head. I can't handle this kind of drama rn though. 
The mom is like "no don't help him, he needs to learn" 
My spirit animal. 
Ducks
Felt so bad for the little guy
Welp, that one's gonna get got first
Is there a record for a thread thats had the most gilded comments? 
That moment where it paused and looked around for a bit as if to say:

>Is anyone else seeing this shit I have to put up with?
I've never related to a duckling more in my life 
What a crazy roller coaster of emotions that little 56 second clip took me through.  I am emotionally drained.  
I found myself silently cheering for the duckling, then pumping my first in the air when it made it up. Good job little buddy!
You did it! Yay!
I'm just glad they waited for him.
Guess who won't spread his genes here... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Slick was so scared he/she was going to get left. Screamed at my phone.
That one kid in Destiny during the raid 
This was better than a lot of movies I've seen 
Most satisfying gif ever!
/r/gifsthatendatpreciselytherightmoment
Mama duck with the patience
The struggle make it stronger.
Good job baby! Holy crap that made my heart stop, I was so happy when he made it 
What's going on with all the gold?
I kinda sorta chanted "You can do it!!"

Its so c00t!!
r/nonononoyes
What commitment, funny how he seemed to stop for a second and think of a different strategy. 
Oh god, my heart!
That duckling learned a lot more about survival than his brothers and sisters did that day.
[r/GetMotivated](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/?st=J26PO2TF&sh=20ea2f54) 
Damn, all the gold in this thread!

But really, was rooting for the little chap and was worried they were going to leave him.. Good on him for pulling through though!
I didn't upvote until i saw that the duckling made it
You can do it little buddy! Just keep at it!.... I super believe in you Tad Cooper *ahem* I mean little duckling... Yay you did it! 
I love how animals work. The mothers don't help their young do things they know they can do. Humans need some of that.
Why isn't camera person helping out? 
Little guy almost got naturally selected...
I think I need to take a breather after watching that 
The amount of strength in their little drumsticks is amazing.

No wonder duck confit tastes so good!
I almost got hit by a car today and somehow this gif made my heart beat faster.
"Momma wait - *oof* - I'm tryin' - *oof* - don't go without me - *oof* - why is this so - *oof* - hard... *oof* This heckin' ledge - *oof* - sonofabitch *oof*"
OP is this in the Greystone neighborhood of North Raleigh NC?
Oh look, it's me trying to progress in life!
How could someone just sit back and watch a duckling struggle like this
I was rooting for that little fucker so hard. Pretty sure my neighbors heard me
Lol
Luckily not on r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Adorable kid of his mother .
More exciting than 90%of movies last year.
He probably still got made fun of by his siblings.
My mom would have left be behind
He throws a few donald duck fits when he lands badly
Knew what was coming and still had to utter "yes!" aloud when he succeeded. 
His family didn't even care
Darwin aproves
Question, would the mama duck leave the duckling if it wasn't strong enough?
I was very afraid that I was going to walk away from this upset 
All I'm thinking is "come on, you can do it!" Cheering him/her on as if it can feel my encouragement. 
Mom wasn't even excited. Wtf
Needs crouch + jumping practice
If that was me with the camera then I would have had to have helped him up after his second fall.
Ozzy Reviews incoming!
Omg, I love ducks :D
Momma duck waited. Dad would have left. üòÇ
Soooooo happy that the little duckling succeeded. Made my heart melt. 
this was extremely frustrating to watch.. 

oh-oh-oh, he's got it this ti..FUCK. 
On the one hand that little duckling is the worst of his family at climbing walls. But on the other hand, those other ducklings will never be cheered for by thousands of the beings that rule the planet. Their wall climbing skills will never be recognized as much as that other duckling's perseverance.

So quack it up dirtbags, that little duckling has already won.
It's good that I'm not a duckling...I'd have probably got concussion the first try and quit and ended up eaten by next door's cat.


Never, ever give up 
I actually cheered out loud when he finally made it
I was really worried the rest of them were just going to leave him. I'm glad they waited. (,:
Alternatively, the first 3/4th of this gif show me in college 
Poor little guy. I bet he was nice and pooped after that.  
That shit was stressful to watch
Oh my goodness! I am sad now. I know that ended happily but what a hit on his confidence that must've been. Like what is his fam just gave up and left without him
If mama duck couldn't hear the little one left behind, how would she know it was missing?  Can she count the little ones?
This is me anytime someone finds a new way to skip mobs in a WoW dungeon.
And that's why predators go after the weak
That's me in PE
I was really hoping the mom would head back down the curb and back where they came from once he made it up there. 
later that little duckling developed sadistic tendencies 
Neat.
That little guy needs a fucking nap now. 
It is a gold treasure chest up in here.
Mother duck: well that's one less mouth to feed. Fuck he got up. I shouldn't have pretended to care for so long.
It is the strongest amongst them all. It has the Strongest mentality and body.
Kinda feel bad that mumma duckling didn't even recognise the effort.
All I can imagine is him having a Donald Duck style frustration freak out when he is stuck on his back with his legs kicking. 
I was cheering out loud for the duck.
This would be epic edited with geometric formulas and graphs on every jump attempt 
I have a job interview today and somehow this duckling making it was SO important to me. Thank you /r/aww
Pretty sure this one left alone is named Tony ;-)
That feeling the gif file will repeat itself before the little ducking succeed 
Momma duck and my mother have something in common. Complete lack of empathy for their children
chumbawamba tubthumping 
Ok, who else cheered?

Was I the only one that cheered out loud when he made it? 

Also, this is good advice for life. Keep trying. 
BEST. CAPTION. EVER. 
First of all it was interesting to watch the parent hold off on helping, and, best of all, it was great to watch the duckling take a moment before the final successful jump to compose itself and gather the energy it needed - after all those tiring failures - to succeed. And I guess, maybe, it's worth observing that tiring failures build strength.
The little repost that always makes its way back.
The little duckling that almost couldn't.

*Insert moral of the story here*
Whenever I feel like life is getting me down and I can't go on, I will remember this little duckling and his determination.
Silently cheering for a duckling wasn't on my to do list today, but thats okay cause that little duck has a inspirational amount of determination :)
omg, the times he was stuck on his back spinning his wheels like a turtle would...
Most motivated I've ever been in my whole life.
Keep trying little duck! All of Reddit is rooting for you!
I'm going to name him "womp"!
Someone should post a copy of the gif that ends right as he makes his final jump. 
-.- sigh. finally. but mom plz help next time!
He'll be the first to die.

Mom blows 
My job search IRL, minus the ending
"Thanks for the help, MOM!"
Couldn't commit to the upvote until it finally made it up the wall. 
Mom's a dick for not helping out. 
That was such an emotional rollercoaster for me.
I especially like that brief pause just before he finally makes it, like he's giving himself a pep talk

'Come on Steve you got this, everyone's watching you!'
No celebration?
I verbally cheered when he finally did it
This is adorable! This also accurately represents my life. 
An amazing story of perseverance. Oscar worthy performance - the star made me feel doubt, sorrow, frustration, anger and finally joy. Stunts and direction were top notch; I felt more tension than any movie see yet this year. 
I am watching my team in the playoffs right now and I was just cheering for that little duck a lot louder than for them.
I love when it first fell on its back and was flailing and probably quacking "MOM MOM MOM MOM" and she turned and walked towards the edge like "OK I guess I'll have to help you" but then it got back up and started trying again so she just let it keep trying.  That's how you learn, young'n.
I open the gif and [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Ug0kEn2g8) plays from my playlist. I'm sorry... I need a minute.
This brought back memories of trying to get over the "Everest" obstacle at Tough Mudder.
JUMP WILLIE!!! JUMP!!!
Someone needs to cut out the ending of the gif and repost it. Imagine the tension of everyone not knowing if the ducky made it. 
This without the ending bit describes me rn haha... (anyone have a gif of that out there?)
I'm so happy it had a good ending. 
That was a rollercoaster, I laughed, I cried. Happy for the ducking. 
Yeah!
I imagine the mom like: Come on sweeties, your brothers and sisters a re waiting
This. Wait... yeah these never work.
"here I am momma, here I am!" -arnie the duck
Dude I was ready to book a flight with United just to go help him. These are live right?
/r/GetMotivated
The mother duck was like "I don't know this duckling"
Last night I took an L, but tonight I bounce back!
Never saw so much gold in one thread :O
Try and try and try until you can call uber
 If the duckling can do it, so can Mexicans. 
Say what you will but his mom ain't no duck, it's a bitch.
Ducklings are my favorite!
Why is almost everyone guilded here?
I've never been so stressed out in my life
Someone went trigger happy with the gold, damn. 
https://giphy.com/gifs/PXvCWUnmqVdks
The tension!
Ducks are low key super cute
The mom just sits there like "This may take a while" 
"Ducks fly together" my ass... Apparently it's every duck for himself out in these mean backyards.
OH MY GOD it hurts so much to see him trying!!!
Omg this stressed me out. Poor baby
He looks like he's at Magic Kingdom. He'll be fine. =]
Never give up... (on this GIF)
I've never cheered something on so much in my life!
http://i.imgur.com/hTzQ98H.gifv
Legitimate question:
What would have happened if he couldn't get up there? 
Would the Mother eventually leave and abandon him? 


Sorry for assuming genders BTW
Reminds me of the warped wall on American Ninja Warrior
Using this as my resume in case I don't have a picture of Bruce Jenner handy
That was an emotional roller coaster 
" Okay guys this ti- Ugh.. Alright.. now! ARG! "
Was hoping he'd parkour that shit with the wall. 
That's me when my party is doing complex wall jumping to skip trash. 
Do runts of the litter like that often survive?
Pretty major design flaw, mother duck
Never cheered harder for a little duckling in my life.
I'm glad they waited for him.
Notice how no one gives that duckling praise or a trophy.
That made me feel like sometimes I give up too soon.
Anybody else yelling, "help him!" at their screen?
cameraman pick it up asshole
that remind me of myself in life except for the final jump that succeeded 
Yay!!!!!!!!!!!! I was rootin' for ya!
I was stressed watching him but was telling the screen "it will only make you stronger, little buddy".
You can see the last time it failed he paused for a moment before trying the final time. So determined
That mom duck didn't give AF. I was expecting her to help at least. Glad the little guy made it. 
r/GetMotivated
I'm exhausted!
Just gotta keep trying til you finally make it over. Speak to me Lawd!!
When you try your best but don't secede 
Oh the cute little ducklings! But no one cares about the cute little chicks that just get grinded up alive in egg production. Gotta have those chicken eggs! 
Fucking hypocrites. 
Should have gotten the elephant to help him. 
I was cheering so hard. When he finally made it i shouted "YES" so loud i woke my roommate...whoops
