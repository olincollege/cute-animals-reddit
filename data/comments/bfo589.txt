Seeing how that cat snuggles and kisses him makes me realize why that kid is so emotional

If I would lose a friend like that I would react the same, and I'm in my 30s
those little kitty kisses got me
Awww, I cried like a baby when I found my cat that was lost for 3 weeks.
*the cat missed him too omg*
I lost my cat for an hour on a really REALLY bad emotional day. This was me when we found the turd hiding in a kitchen cabinet.
Our cat is missing. He’s been gone for eight days. Signs are up, animal control checked, we keep looking. I pray for this kind of happy homecoming. Thank you for giving us hope.
Hope this doesn't fall under the 'sad category' here. I personally find this really happy and emotional. I've been through something simmilar when I was a kid as well. Found my cat on a tree after 1 month away, after animal rescue center called me and said he suits to the description I gave them. He was meowing like crazy for an hour (probably got scared by some dogs) and didn't wanna come down to anyone, untill I came there. It was one of the best feelings ever. He had lost quite of his weight though, but we got him back in shape pretty quickly :-)
Cats are crazy smart creatures. We had issues with my next door neighbor and my semi-outdoor cat, so my dad took him to my grandmas to let things settle down. Nemo escaped the first day, and while it took him over a week, he navigated over a mile from somewhere he’d never been across 5 lane roads and found his way home. I was 30 at the time and cried just as hard as that kid when I saw him waiting in the driveway when I got home from work one day. He was mostly to himself, but he knew where he belonged and licked all my tears away lol

Edit: A great thank you to whoever gave the gold, this is my first time getting this!
We need volume ;(
There's such an unexplainable amount of relief and happiness when you find a lost pet, beautiful post.
whew child, my heart
My cat ran away when I was 15 and it killed me for years, I had always hoped for this kind of homecoming, this gives me all the feels 😭 I am so overjoyed for him
Aaaand I'm crying at work
You can see how gently he cradles her despite the fact that all he wants to do is squeeze her to his chest and never let go.
My wife and I were on vacation in Ireland when our house sitter lost our cat. The sitter didnt realize the cat was lost until nearly 2 weeks into the trip. We rushed home to find our little fur lady had been sheltered and the adoption process had already begun with a new family. The vet couldn't reach us via the microchip information. It was a goddamn headache, but when we got to the shelter our prissy lady just flopped limply in my arms after being cold and distant to everyone else. It was good.
Get your cats microchipped! I bring in a lot of strays to shelters and they always check for a chip.
Made me cry. Beautiful
I’m crying too now
Right in the feels, thanks.
Who is cutting onions? 

My cat didn’t come home last night (first time ever in 4 years) and I was worried sick all night.  He was at the door this morning meowing to come in.  

This video hit me right in the feels.
7 months? He was probably so surprised ... wow this is so sweet

What a touching reunion!
This the kinda of post that makes me want to upvote every comment.  
Take your upvotes.

Except for those fuckers with downvotes, you deserve them.
Please microchip your pets so we can see more videos of people getting their pets back <3 <3
How I react when I see my cat after coming home from work.
Beautiful
Man, I feel that kid. Glad the cat is home!
Am I the only one that finds it a little weird to film something like this?
Kuwabara: "Eikichi!"
Immediately afterwards the cat jumped onto the coffee table and knocked a glass off.

AWWWWW RIGHT IN THE FEELS
r/surprisereunions
I’m a dog person and for some reason this is the first video I’ve ever seen and immediately felt tears running down my face.
His cat looks just like my cat Ender!
https://imgur.com/gallery/3dAmC
Seeing him go from crying to laughing and smiling really did it for me
This makes my heart happy
This is so sweet
Animal Control Officer here. Just a few things i wanna keep telling people.

1. MICROCHIP!!!!! Get them! They're like $15 at most and any local vet can do it. It's not a GPS, but it is an ID tag that any shelter or vets office that your lost pet gets brought into can scan and find the serial number, then look that number up and find your information and now you have your pet back. Quick and easy. 

2. Lost cats almost never get found for a few reasons. First would be that very few pet owners microchip their pets, so if you put your cat outside (please don't) and a neighbor happens to trap your cat on their property and they take it into the Animal Shelter, there's a very high chance you'll never see that cat again. If the cat has no microchip and is friendly with the staff they put your cat up for adoption and your cats gone. If your cats scared and hisses or scratches at the staff and the neighbor says they don't want them back, your cat gets put to sleep instantly because its assumed to be feral. 

Moments like the one in this video are so extremely rare because people just don't take basic precautions with their pets. Get them spayed and/or neutered so they don't have that urge to escape and breed. Get them a microchip so if they do get lost and end up in a shelter the shelter has a way to know its an owned animal and has a way to get your information. Collars don't always stay on, especially cat collars that are designed to snap off if they get stuck on something. Don't put your fat, comfy inside cat outside, and don't put them outside by themselves. There are so many dangers that an inside cat is not accustomed to outside.
I get that this is emotional and sweet, but is there nothing parents dont record and put online these days? Damn. I would hate being a kid these days with a camera pointed at me for every important moment, no private memories - all shared.
I get it but why do people film this and then post online? I'm really not trying to troll here but I feel people film these things just to put online, not to keep to themselves or to just enjoy the moment without documenting it for broadcast.
What is with these videos with no fucking sound. How does one even achieve that? You have to go out of your way to remove the audio from a video, right?
Animals just know
"Man reunited with 80k karma after repost returns after 2 months"
At first I was like man the cat isn’t even going to give a fuck. And then the cat started to give a fuck.
Here is a cool story. So I found a cat at my house one night. Took it in and put up posts across different platforms that I had found it. Two days later, a woman came over after asking a few questions and took a look at him. It was the families cat. Turns out the cat went missing 8 months prior across a very busy interstate the night they moved into their new home at least 7 miles away across town. The woman took the cat home and sent pictures of her young daughter crying and holding her lost(kitten at the time) but now found friend. That was a good day.
I'm trying to poop and now I'm crying.
He might screech a bit and pretend he doesn't like it, but I'm going to hug my cat, brb.
I wish I could hold my Wolfie one more time like that............sigh...........

Hope they keep that bond for a long time.
Gives me hope that my cockatiel that flew away 25 years ago will return. I know he has been living his best life and I’ve moved 7 times but I do update my address with USPS so it should not be too difficult to find me.
My cat shit on my lap last week
I am so glad my parents let me have personal moments with family without having to be conscious of a camera in my face or strangers watching me be so vulnerable. 
I really hate that parents exploit these very personal moments of their kids just for likes. 

I feel like it conditions kids to “put on the right face” and perform when they shouldn’t be focusing on that at all.
This was me after I lost my cat for 3 hours. Can't even imagine what this kid went through.
i had a kitten that was taken away from me because my mom's cat didn't like him. it's been six years and i still miss him
When I was about his age, we lost a cat. Hopped the fence, gone never to return (not an outdoor cat).
Possibly the saddest feeling I've ever experienced.
So I know just how the kid felt. Lucky boy.

Still miss you, Tarn.
take those garbage earrings outta your ear lobes boy
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
"Human! I have returned! Are you happy to be reunited with me?"

_boy cries hysterically_

"...have I done something wrong? Why do you cry?"
And people say cats arent emorional and hate everyone. Its literally giving him kisses.
;-; when the cat started licking his face I DIED!
My cat disappeared for over half a year. He was 100% outdoor cat so we assumed the worst. Then after a few months he shows up out of the fucking blue. To this day we don’t know where he was. Our only theory is some other family was taking care of him but eventually he got out.
You can see how many tales the cat has when gently kissing back the boy.  
"i missed you too my brother and the stories I had if only you could understand me!"
Some things should be left private. Shitty parents.
Cat "wtf is this kid doing to me"
My cat would’ve let me hug him for maybe five seconds then yowl at me to fuck off.
*lick lick lick 

Mmmm salty human tears
I have seen this video many times... Never has the length of time been the same.
Man I'm bringing home a [pup](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/CUcygB0) from the pound, tomorrow. I can't wait for my daughter to have this relationship.
Reunited and it feels so gooooood
I lost my cat once. Then I realized that he was stuck under the recliner lol
I don’t like kids or cats....why am I crying?
This is also my reaction when I just come home and see my cat after work everyday.
My cat was recently missing for less than 24 hours and I still balled like a baby, while she was gone and after she returned. A cats bond is something special.
So sweet he really loves that kitty.
I was told cats don't give a damn, but today all I see is cats deeply bonded with their humans. This one takes the cake, though. You can't oversee the comfort lickings from the cat.
Hungover me can not handle this right now...brb gonna cry.
Rumor says that cats are super independent creatures. Some are. But both my cats are the contrary. They love being around their humans.

When me or my fiance have to go out, one of my cats will carry her toy and cry out around the apartment. 

We'll often come home to a pile of toys in our bedroom, where I assume our scent is strongest. Very cute.
My cats act like this when I'm gone for even a few hours. I've currently been away for 2 days now.
Kid looks a bit young for jail..and wholesome too. Wonder why 7 months?
Those kitties pulling the DENNIS system on us
I lost it at the cat kiss at the end
Where'd this 7month business come from? Think you just made that bit up
Kitty kisses
If that doesn't melt your heart, you don't have one...
I feel this. I love my cat so much, he's practically my best friend & whenever he gets outside he's gone for at least a month.
That made my day happier. The joy and emotion expressed....my goodness
tears of joy .. & look how happy the cat is to be home !!
This just brings my heart to an utter bitter aww
My cat was gone an hour and I was panicking lol I couldn't imagine 7 months
This would be a totally different video is it was an unaffectionate cat
Reverse Matthew McConaughey
What did this kid do to get sentenced to 7 months in the clink?
Every last one of you hugged your cat after this
too wholesome for my heart
This kid’s classmates will see this and give him crap for it. I want them all to know my husband was crying harder than this when our lost kitty came home, and he’s 56. (Of course I was crying too)
Wow a cat that actually likes its owner? This is weird
This is me and my cat after I come home from work
Must not cry with joy too!! Lol
I lost my amazing kitty in 2012. I still have hope that one day we will find him, though I know how unbelievably unlikely that is. This is a great moment caught on camera. I’m happy for your family and your cat. Congrats.
Imagine when it dies
CATS KILL ANXIETY
I got my first ever kitties at the beginning of the year. I love them with all my heart and I honestly don’t know what I would do if they got lost. I saw a lost cat sign in my neighborhood and honestly made tear up after experiencing the close bond I have with my cats. They’re both snuggled up to my legs right now. Yesterday was extremely stressful and As soon as I sat down Cayde nestled up between my legs, under the chair and stayed there the whole time. He’s been following me around ever since
This man. These are the feelings that we live for. Super choked up rn.
Dog owners-‘cats don’t show love’ 🙄🙄🙄🙄 

Sincerely, a person who loves dogs, but likes cats that bit more ❤️
I can relate to this so much.  My cat Kiki was an indoor/outdoor cat and every day or so she would be back at the door meowing away to come back inside. But one time she didnt come back for months like this video and my dad sat me down to tell me that she might not be coming back because it’s been so long. Just as I was going to get emotional we heard a loud meow at my back porch door, I was so happy she was back but I always wondered what adventures she had outside. sadly Kiki died a couple months ago at age 19 so she had a long happy life still makes me cry to this day.
Smart you waited along time to repost this so people don't catch on.
Omfg I’m going to die from such love here 😭😭
I’m not crying, *you are*
Yup, I'm crying. 24 year old male crying over here
We all cried
A whole 3 years since I lost my cat. 'Whistler' was a house cat until one day the babysitter accidentally left the front door open and he ran away. I think he was hit by a car according to my neighbor who had seen some roadkill that looked like Whistler. Plus the cat was always loved and fed so no reason for him to vanish...So long Whistler.
This give me hope for my kitty coming back, yet its been over a year.
My cat has been missing for two weeks. I hope he comes back soon 🧡
Kitty looks happy too!
Meanwhile,i'm still waiting for my cat :(
Something similar happened to my cat. On Christmas day of 2015 (I think), my cat went out and didn't come back. 

We haven't seen him since.
Nah man I just got something eye
I wish people would let others have these emotional moments without having a fucking camera pointed at their face so that their pain and elation can be traded for internet points
And the cat: "Eh, I'm fine. Yeah, I'm happy to be home too and I missed you, but I lived. Here's some kissies to make you feel better."
That cat loves his boy.
*cat didn't give a fuck*
is anyone else crying or is it just me ?
I love that the kitty seemed to understand that he was distressed and stayed even though he wanted to kinda get away at first. I can't blame a cat for when being suddenly held by a crying big being clutching them, but it's so nice that the kitty realized that this was needed for the kid.  


Also, I'm not crying, you're crying.
I lost a cat for 10 days once, I had pretty much given up and called him from the back door one last time and saw him coming out of the woods. He was filthy and skinny, I think he’d gone through the patch of woods and got trapped in a neighbors shed or garage. I sat on the floor bawling and watching him eat. He’s on my lap now (years later- he doesn’t get to go out in the yard anymore) and I’m thinking about how this is probably his last year of life (tumors in his ear and sinuses) and how much I will miss him when he’s gone forever. 😢
Jesus Christ...where is my cat, I need to give her a hug after this.
Those two were tight.
Ok but where the *hell* did that cat go for 7 months?
Our cat just went on a bender for 3-4 months, got pregnant, then turned up again like nothing happened.
"Hey, wtf, its human, oh no the little human, get away yikes. Oh it's killing me..."
I went to Europe for 10 days and when I got back the first thing my cat did was bite me in the face....must be nice kid, must be nice.
This will probably get buried because this has already blown up, but I still love the story.  

My family had a cat when we were growing up. The cat didn’t really have anything special about it, although it did have some peculiar traits. The cat had special bonds with the men in my family, especially my older brother.   

When we were all older, the cat got lost for a week. Somehow, it snuck out during a rainstorm and hunkered inside a nearby car engine.  The car belonged to some neighbors’ friends who were visiting from the next town over. The cat ended up riding in the engine (we still have no idea how it survived) to the next town over when they left.  We found out from the neighbors kids who knew the people because they just happened to overhear their story about a “stray” cat wondering around their car.  We had posters up about our missing cat, and the kids knew. The people had taken our cat to the town vet, and my family went to pick him up. We got our cat back, and it was a happy ending. 

When my brother came home to visit from college while the cat was missing, my mom had to tell my brother. My brother isn’t really an emotional guy. I’ve only seen him cry a few times. But when my mom told him about the cat, my brother bawled. Like ugly crying. 

Just reminds me how special a bond it is between a family and their pets.
I’m still waiting for 2 years to meet my dog. Hope my day will come. I love this. Bless you.
Long enough for him to have thought the fluffy little beauty was gone...and then he’s suddenly got it back and his reaction is just so heart warming
That’s great! That kid is so lucky! My cats been gone for a year and a half...
Reposted so many times and still gets 18k upvotes. If I repost it gets like 2. Seems legit.
This comment section makes me lose so much hope in humanity
Man I only lost mine for three weeks and I had the same reaction. This poor kid is a champ.
Likely how I'll feel once we get a house and I can bring my best bud with me this time. I feel it man.
This video got me ugly crying. If I ever lost my cat I would be a WRECK. That animal fucking completes me. He is the only creature on this earth I love more than my own mother.
I lost my cat for five years. The animal welfare league called me up and asked if cat was still micro chipped under my name. I almost fainted. I mourned her loss for years.  When I went to pick her up they said she had been pretty hissy and unhappy and hadn't moved from the bed.  As soon as I called out her name she jumped out of her bed and started meowing for me and headbutting the cage to get to me. I still wonder what she did all those years. Still going strong the old biddy she's almost 12 now. So glad this little dude got his friend back.
I hope my dog comes back
A best friend for a lifetime
reminds me of this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoxVL0aLLw&feature=youtu.be

these types of things always make me tear up ;(
AWWWWWWW
I'm not crying, you're crying!

My reaction was this: during an emotionally charged event, the last thing I want is to have a video camera on me. I can't know my own true authentic feelings if I'm preoccupied with acting on camera.
"I tolerate you." 
-Cat
That's a cat.
The best advice I ever received when my cat was missing - over 90% or lost cats are ultimately found within 100ft of their home. Yes, there are lots of confounding factors there, but if you can’t find him/her, just remember that it’s more like that they are hiding out really close by, rather than a county away. So don’t give up hope. Call their name. Cats know your voice (if not their name). Keep checking your deck and porch and yard. Leave out food and water and watch. Don’t give up hope and keep talking to your neighbours!

I’m so sorry for you, it’s an awful feeling. Keep hoping and trying. When I thought all hope was lost for me, she came back. I believe in you!
I once thought I lost my cat. Spent a good three or so hours searching the entire house, calling for him, shaking treats, even looked outside and asked neighbors (even though we lived in an apartment and it would have been hard for him to get out). I sobbed as I thought of him somehow getting out and getting squished by a car. My mom and I sat down in the kitchen, crying, after searching to no avail. Suddenly, we hear a meow and here’s the little guy standing next to us like no big deal. The relief I felt, oh my goodness. Once I finally was done loving on him, I put him down and ended up following him to see if he’d go to a hiding spot again. Ends up he was hiding under the bed as there was a slit open on the bottom. It was impossible to see him unless you knew he was down there. I can only imagine if he was gone for months, would have been heartbreaking!
Why does this poor child have 2 peircings in his ear?
This warms my heart.
Honestly, I hate this shit. Why do parents have to record everything. Can’t a moment like this be private???
Someone's cutting onions in here...
what exactly is the appropriate age for a boy to get his ear pierced?
How this kid balding at 7?
Thats a new cat. Don't tell the kid.
This is me with my cat every day after work
That hairline though.
Yo I needed this today. Cheers everyone.
That cat had a side family. That side family is missing the cat now too. Or they are wondering where that weird cat that kept showing up went.
“Hooman why you cry, I lick tears”
Awwww. That is the sweetest. I’m glad he got his kitty back.
Boy:OMG my cat is back"STARTS CRYING AND HOLDES THE CAT/KISSES HER/HIM"

Cat:Good I'am back now feed me peasant.
This is beautiful. Bless these two.
[deleted]
Wow those earrings look horrible
Cat: I didn’t come back to be manhandled! Release me peon!
One of the strongest bonds in the world
This is the greatest thing I have seen in a while
Why do people film this stuff and post it online?
QUICK, JAM A FUCKING CAMERA RIGHT IN HIS FUCKING FACE

THIS WILL GET ME SO MANY SOCIAL MEDIA LIKES
I would be the same way
These are my favorite videos
I friggin teared up at work damn it!
Now I’m crying at work

Reunion is the best. No matter human or animals
This almost made me cry. So sweet
Owww my heart!
I know how that feels.
Aww the babies are reunited. I can feel the relief and happiness of the boy and his friend. I need to go hug something, brb.
Thank you for making my day.
Someone is cutting some onions....**sniff
Cat was tired of traveling the world
r/wholesome
Too early to be crying.. at least they are happy tears for a change
Dammit, you made me cry.
This is the goodness we need in our lives.
That's another cat person secured for the cat apocalypse. Quickly children, the end is nigh!
I almost started crying when I seen this!
What a sweet and loving little boy. You can tell the cat missed him too
And now I'm crying. This is really so sweet, the emotions in this video! I love that the meower was trying to comfort their boy too.
That's wonderful 😊
Damn. I felt that...
omg I'm crying that was so precious <3 so happy his kitty is home safe
My sister’s cat went missing once a few months ago. She and her boyfriend searched for him all over her apartment and around the neighboring apartments for days. The rest of our family even got involved in trying to find him. Every time we saw a cat for nearly 4 straight days, we checked to see if it was him.  Then one day, they were sitting in their apartment with the windows open and they heard something. They went outside and saw the cat up on the roof of the apartment, meowing at them to get him down. They did get him down eventually, but it’s so like him to make everyone search high and low for him while he’s right under our noses.
Look how much that cat loves this boy. The time apart was just as hard for the pet as it was for him... Who's slicing onions in here???
Like some young kid with ear piercings looking real hard.
And that kid grew up to become Shane dawson
Thats true love right there
Heartstrings officially tugged.
Why do cats do this? My cat was the same, he was gone for 5 months and suddely just appeared
This is warming up my heart. Happy to see a team united again.
Ohhhh my heart ❤️
I genuinely aww'd at this
That would be me, at work right now, but goddam will hug the hell outta my cat when I get home after watching this
that is true love right there
This is so sweet! He must have gone through so much when his cat went missing.
That’s so beautiful, much love and happiness sent your way
I didn't think I'd cry today when I woke up but oh well
I really love this video so much!
Man, right in the feels this Easter morning
Well this hit me right in the feels
When I was a kid my parents got me my first kitten by hiding him under the bed when I got back from a trip. 

They were just sitting there on the bed with this huge smile on their faces. Then I felt something brush against my leg and immediately made the same face this kid had.
I cried....
I was not planning on crying this morning, but here we are
So awesome!! :) :)
I don't like cats but this is so fucking precious the love between them , bless their souls.
This kills me every time. Instant tears.
I'm going to steal my kids cat for a year and then return it and film it! Think of all the points I can get!
7 months? Where was he, prison?
I haven’t been feeling the best lately and this is honestly what I needed. This is supremely /r/wholesome .

I almost teared up after seeing the boy’s emotional reaction and the cat snuggling him and giving him a headbutt at the end. I’m glad they got reunited.
I miss my lost cat...sigh
That made me cry. I never cry.
Shut up! I'm not crying! You're crying! 

^(I miss my cats... I gotta get home soon)
I am not crying, you are.
This just tugs on your heart strings ❤
*happy cat noises*
Awww so sweet!
Cat be like: "Meh"
So pure
....My cat pees on me while I sleeping if I don't feed him enough
I needed this today, thank you.
That's a very sweet young man and a very lucky kitty. I wish you many happy years together!
Reddit, it’s too early for this... I cried with him!
I lost it at the sweet face kisses 😭😭😭😭
I’m not crying
My eyeballs are just sweating tears of happiness
God, I miss my Murray. Lost last fall, I can only hope he's found a new home and is very happy.
I'm cryin' too kid.
Had a cat named Jables that ran away when I was like 10. Never came back, though. I still think about him 10 years later.
Man, when I was that age my cat got away for a week and only came back after one of our neighbors found her. I can't imagine losing her for seven months, I'd have been a wreck by then.
invisible nija cut onions somewhere near...
I've just got something in my eye that's all.
That’s a dog actually
Absolutely precious ❤️
Oh bless!
Oh, mah hart ❤️ 

I needed this wholesome goodness on a Sunday morning.
Damn I wasn’t ready for these feels. This is so sweet
Omg it's so cute😩
This kid deserved his cat.
BITCH WHAT THE FUCK IM CRYIN
Bam! Right in the feels.
and I'm crying.
This is very sweet. 

Am I on drugs for thinking there are numerous videos of this same kid getting reunited with loved ones. Did everyone leave him at the same time??
I wish nothing but happiness to these two
Boy - *cries* 
Cat - "mmmm salty tears"
The cat didnt even try to escape ❤ he missed the boy too
This is sooooo heartwarming
Hmmm....I need to visit my parents (and their cats)
"My water bowl is empty. Must obtain sustenance from tears."
Despite being the coolest kid in school with his earings, he showed his true emotions. What a great kid. ❤️
Your tears sustain me peasant human
Ive seen this a few times and it still gets to me. I need to cuddle my cat now. :')
This is so sweet. I lost a cat 3 years ago but I never found him. I used to go looking for him every evening after work for 3 months. It still makes me sad.
Ginger cats are the sweetest
Well, I’m crying now
I’m not crying...you are 😭
God i know this feeling so well, had two pets go missing (thankfully they both made it back) and after weeks, months of searching and being convinced something had happened to them, seeing them home was the boggest relief i could imagine
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
My heart is so full
this would be me if i found out that my favorite stray was alive. No one told me if she really died, they only told me that there is a very big chance she'll die. I still miss her :(
He has the same hairline as TheRussianBadger
made me tear up a little :,)
Well this is just the cutest thing I’ve seen all week. I don’t know this child, but I love him and his cool earrings and strong love he has for his kitty :)
My heart ❤️❤️❤️
This made me think of a movie I found very moving in the '70s called [JT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS2flty4wA4). It's about a kid (black) in the ghetto who finds and feeds a stray cat. It really knocked me out. The moment where he shouts out "I want me that cat I found", which I haven't seen since then but I am pretty damn sure it's in the movie to this day, really hit me. A boy's love for a little animal, a little cat in the ghetto. Just gets to me. Hit me hard back then.
Please tell me they gave that cat a bath before letting that kid rub his face all over it.
Tries not cry. Cries
THERES ONIONS SOMEWHERE NEARBY
Huuuman.. mmyy neckkk
I know this feeling, not for 7 months, but I know it. it almost makes me cry just watching it.
I miss my bf.
Also me, literally every day when I walk in the door and see my pupper.
My cat ran for 1 night  instantly came back lmao he was like fuck that shit I got a home
I lost it with the kitty kisses
Gif reunited with sound after seven months apart.
"ThEy'Re JuSt aNiMalSsssss TheY DonT hAvE FeeEEEeeeeliiiiNnNNgggggSSSssSSssss"
And people (dog lovers/cat haters) say cats have no emotions. :''''''')
They truly are our best friends
Does anyone know where the meow meow went?  Did it go on sabbatical or something?
I once lost my dog briefly and I went full man on fire
That is so pure. Love it.
That me, after I don’t see my two boys for a 12 hour work day. Can’t imagine 7 months!
How come there’s no sound? I’m on narwhal app
* * tries not to cry *
Cry a lot
Ah...

Now I can't stop crying..
Omg this is so cute. The cat licks his tears away. Omg omg awwwww 😍😍😍
Dead...too much cuteness
Damn Gingers, always making me cry.
That's bloody beautiful. Very heart warming
Dang it, I'm crying my eyes out on Easter Sunday, in the car on the way home from church, to our awaiting  big family meal. I shouldn't be looking like a blubbering fool. LoL! Honestly I'm just so happy that kitty made it home to his obviously very beautiful & loving family. 😻
I'm not crying, you are.
Shit! I read car. I really need to start using glasses
I gotta question the parents that film this shit.  Yeah, its terribly moving, but I imagine Patricia thinking "Oh my God, I cant wait to see how many likes I get for filming this"
After a minute, I bet the cat swats him. I fucking love cats.  :)
Oh man I love cats so much
This is the first time I saw a cat give a shit during a reunion LOL
😭😭
I feel like crying that was so adorable and when the cat licked the boys face you could see that cat had missed him too
r/MadeMeCry
Where had it been for 7 months? Did it come back on it’s own?
I hate when parents film their kids like this
7 months at that age is a loooong time, this made me smile :D
Is this a repost or did the cat run away AGAIN?
Ginger missed me
Stupid cat! Your boy missed you so much
The cat licking his face got me ugly crying omg
As someone who's cat disappeared 2 months ago this is so cute
I cried too.
me when i come home from uni
He’s not crying, i’m crying
I don't let my cats out. This is why.
Two gingery souls, together at last.
I'm not crying you're crying.
15 seconds in cat is starting to remember why he left.
Im cried😿😢
Damn, 7 months is like 5 cat years and 3 boy years!
Watching this boy being with his cat again just made me happy
Never mind me, just cutting some onions over here. 

True joy in that face - makes me think of the seven months of misery leading up to it. And also wonder what the cat has been up to.
I kind of hate that cameras are just in kids faces all the time now.
His name better fucking be Calvin and the cat's name better fucking be Hobbes.
Ive seen this gif like a thousand times and never noticed that he had earrings in before.
Repost
That’s beautiful 💕
I need a new box of tissues.
What a heartwarming scene!
That's so cute! I could never imagine losing my dog for seven months
how does this happen so often. are y’all really leaving your indoor house cats outside unsupervised? if so that’s fucked.
This is so awesome!!!!
I would never let my cat go after 7 months. We lost our oldest for 5 days and it was horrible
My dad sold my cat because it was a pure bred siamese cat and someone wanted to use him for breeding. He told me that he ran away and then said that he lived on a farm. Years later he told me the truth that he sold him. Cat reunions always hit me really hard.
A decade ago I was having a new mattress delivered. The company took our old mattress and box spring. Afterwards we couldn’t find our cat. Did all the usual freaking out, looking everywhere, etc. Eventually we had the crazy idea that he might have been INSIDE the old box spring because it had a few holes in the fabric. He was! I had to drive like 45 minutes and they had him in a bathroom.
Was anyone else hoping the cat just attacked him after the hug?
me
🙂
Okay. Cried as hard as he did!
Now I'm tearing up in the break room at work 😭😭😭
"animals can't love"

fuck outta here
This is how I feel after not seeing my dog for a weekend.
My cat was knocked over and killed almost 2 weeks ago..bit too early to watch this!
100 cc's of pure /r/eyebleach
Church?? Is that you??
Dad: Look son I found skippy!  He's your cat you lost not any other cat that looks just like him I promise!
Isn’t this the same kid that was reunited with his dog a couple of weeks back and then with his father last month?  I’m pretty sure I saw a video of him crying after being reunited with last night’s dinner on the toilet.
General reposti
This is now my most favorite video of all time.
beautiful
I'm 25 and I would do the exact same thing if that happened with my cat.
I would upvote this one million times if I could.
This is the wholesomest thing I have seen this year <3
Awww. Whenever I go away for a day or two. My kitten gets upset for a week and ignores me, and don’t let me pet her.
This one almost got me. You can't fool me so easily, with those tears of yours!
I'm not crying...
Our little Chihuahua went missing last week, we searched for him for several days and couldn't find him. Someone contacted us with pictures and said that he got killed by a car. Our wife and I just told the kids he ran away. Sucks big time.
Gingers have souls.
Totally expected the cat to be indifferent about the reunion
😭❤
Okkkk now I’m tearing up between sets at the gym.
I’m not crying he’s crying
Wholsome af
This is so sweet, but it makes me cry. I'm so happy for that boy, but I wish my boy could be united with his cat. :(  We had to put him to sleep bc of persistent bladder stones/cystitis/blockage issues. Was no way to live, poor guy was in so much pain even with pain meds. But he was my son's best friend and this cat chose my son as his most favorite person. Idk why, he's loud, unpredictable and overly energetic, but there was something about him the cat was drawn to. He'd sleep by his head every night, groom him, and wasn't bothered a bit by my kids craziness. They were inseparable. My son is not happy with me, he doesn't quite understand due to his mental disabilities. It breaks my heart though. I want to find him another siamese mix, he misses his cat and keeps asking for him. Hes open to and excited about the idea of a kitten, so hopefully I can find the perfect one soon.
Omg that made me cry!
only i can say is awwwwwww
Back in the 90s, if you were a kid with two hoop piercings it meant you had a main character to be harassing.
So happy for them!

Brb I need to go snuggle my cat.......
That haircut though
Holy shit I'm a 2 tour Iraq vet, fwd , this bought tears to my glass eye. Love it
Hate to say it, but how do we know it's the same cat.
I feel like I’ve seen this somewhere before... either way, it’s adorable as all hell
Oh, my cold dark heart has awoken 😭😭
Yep better post this to reddit for Karma I am Sure the boy is all for this Decision !!
I'm sobbing
They don’t come back the same...
*cries* even when. Leaving pets for 5 mins
I'm hugging my cat right now.
I've been overseas for 2 months and I go home on the first of May. I am probably gonna be exactly like this with my cat but he will probably run away from me lol
I feel like this every time I walk in my house & see my cats!
Ngl, This video made me cry.
Salt on my face...wha
7 months is like forever in child time.
Probably the cat: Aahh shit, here we go again.
Awwww! 😄
I upvoted this when it had 20 updoots 
I deserve credit for raising him /s
Why were they apart?
omg i cried too!
Wow it got dusty in here! I got something in both eyes but luckily it got washed out. <3
Damn ninja is cutting onion while I'm watching T_T
damn space dust, gettin in my eye!
Immediate tears
Was the kid lost in the woods?  Kidnapped?
"It's ok little human, I'm home."
I worked with a lady once who called off work for 3 days because she lost her cats during her move. So she stayed in bed for 3 days, sobbing, posting on FB nonstop about them being gone and flyers being put up in the city and call her if you see them, etc etc etc. I kid you not, while she was off, the fucking cats crawled out of her couch like nothing was wrong. She had been laying on the couch, on the cats in the couch, for days til they decided to come out of it.
That video warmed my cold, dead heart
Omg that is so cute
lol this reminds me of when I was 9 and my cat left, because in our old house the windows were really big, and my mum kept them open all the time. 

Thing is, we had him for just 3 days
Oh my heart! I'm so happy they are back together. <3
I wish my cat came back fine...
If I were to show emotion like that to my cat, he’d castrate me for being weak.
I'm .not crying your crying.
Good thing there wasn't sound with this video because I don't think my heart could take it.
"lost"
Why you do this to me, Reddit?
I myself cried when i didn't find my bird in his cage he turned out to be flying in the kitchen and trying to fly higher to the window i spent like 2 mins looking at him before grabbing and hugging him and he didn't even notice
🏅🏅🏅
Dammit something in my eyes! 😭
My cat disappeared for 3-4 months. Long since gave up. Dude comes home lost half his body weight. It was over the winter. 

Our only guess is somebody closed up their vacation home cellar while he was exploring. Spring time when they came back he snuck out and came home. Musta been boring.
I wish I got to cry those tears.
I miss my cat :(
No matter how many times this is reposted I will still upvote.
I'm not crying. You're crying
Oh god my heart
Last summer, one of my cats was away for a week.  I went outside one day and I heard something and before I could even turn my cat came running into the house!  I cried and cried and cried...  So happy.  I think he just took a little vacation.
This is adorable
Gorgeous
My dog got out once for 15 mins and this is how i was after, cant imagin what i would do if he was gone for half a year.
Boy who lost cat cries at Star Wars 15 trailer.
Awwwwww little guy... :')
Me after my cat runs outside for 3 minutes ^^
I even remotely can compare to this story. My cat was disappeared for 2 months, over 3 years ago, when I was 13 and although he was overweight he came back thin and fully dehydrated. That was one of my happiest nights.
My kitten disappeared from my 600 sqft apartment. Came home and searched everywhere for him for an hour. All the windows were closed, the door was locked and there's no other way out. Found a note at the end of my hallway saying they found my cat in the hallway meowing and I can pick him up from their condo... So I guess when we left our place with my fiance's giant hockey bag, the fucker bolted out silently. 

The way that asshole sauntered out of the guy's condo just staring at me and meowing..  we had a laugh about it but that was a heart attack and a half.
My....heart?...what...is..this?
If my cat got lost I would be fucking printing out missing posters while trying to find her outside. I would miss work or school, everything. To find that fucking furball.
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
Thank you for this. I needed it today.
I’m so glad my parents never posted childhood videos on the internet
This is the best thing on reddit this entire week.
That’s the sweetest thing ever.
I’m so glad they were reunited. I was torn when my cat got hit by a car years and years ago. I told myself I’d never let my cat outside ever again.
I thought it said car
That’s so beautiful
I live in an area with lots of coyotes.  We lost a kitty a couple weeks ago.  Really sucks but I’m glad this one had a happy ending.
Precious. Beautiful. This is what life is about. ♥️
raw/aww
It's too early for me to be crying.
Turns out it’s hard to poop and abruptly cry at the same time.
Opposite Day over at r/masterreturns
2½ years my cat Benji was gone. Came outside to see him sitting on the porch. I was shocked. Dumbfounded. Benji, not so much. He meowed and walked inside and laid on the couch. Asked where he had been and I got nothing. Still won't tell me.
For a second there I thought the cat was wearing a helmet cam.
Garfield and john when they were young
I lost my cat for 4 months during the winter. It broke my heart, ever since I found him again I spend as much time as I possibly can at home with my cat. He too was a little ginger ball of fur
Omg now I’m ugly crying and I have to redo my makeup
Must be dusty in here my eyeballs are wet
I almost cried
This is soooo so sweet <3 I hope they get to spend many more years together.
I remember losing my cat for a whole year when i was a kid. I didnt leave his side for 3 days when he came back. And god damn he slept alot haha he must have been on an epic journey!
As good as it gets.
Aww tears of joy 😭
aww hes a softie..both of them. i'm not fooled by those double hoops...so moving with and without sound.
Well it's onions again....
I don't like seeing children cry.
Hey! Let's shove this phone all the way in this kids face. Really get in there. Capture the moment!
Ugh, this made me cry bad
Great video. Next time, please film in landscape.

Thanks.
Awww. :)
MY HEART
Damn onions!
I might have teared up over this...
My cat was an indoor cat for most of his life until ran out our front door one day and when we finally found him I tried to get him and he hissed at me and clawed the hell out if me and ran away. Guess he likes it better outside. He comes back every so often to be fed but I havent seen him in a while he probably found a diffrent home.
lil kitty licks
cat comes back from 6 month deployment
This is incredibly sweet, but my first thought is, "He's gonna catch hell for this at school when all his classmates see this."

Maybe kids have gotten better?
I lost my cat for a few hours and had the same reaction, can't imagine 7 months
😊😊
The only thing more touching than the innocence of a child's love is that of loyalty and unconditional love of a beloved pet.  Am happy the two are reunited.
I lost my cat from childhood years ago now. This made me tear up still.

Aww this made me tear up. The first time my cat ran away, I cried so much the entire day, not knowing that he’ll eventually come back. He’s my first ever pet, and I didn’t know much about cats then.
This happened to me with one of my cats, not for 7 months obviously, 2 weeks when I was a similar age, I eventually found her a few streets away and brought her home, ever since she either hasn’t left the house or has gone outside and sit on the same window ledge until she wants to come in
Beautiful
This is cute but just serves to remind me how glad I am that during the first 30 or so years of my life there weren't ubiquitous cameras everywhere capturing my every moment of vulnerability, my every screw up, my every embarrassing situation, to be immediately blasted onto the internet for public scrutiny and comment.
Z CB. lh i
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
This made me miss my boi Osiris, when me and my wife moved into our new apartment, he came with us but was always an outside cat yet stayed right on the staircase waiting to be let in if we didn’t hear his voice. One day i went outside to see if he was there and he wasn’t. 

It was typical that he’d disappear for a bit but then a week went by and nothing, i even went to our past apartments (it wasn’t far mind you) and searched for days.. i still haven’t found him and i hope he found another family if he didn’t come home.
This is adorable and I'm glad they're reunited, they look very happy. 

On a completely unrelated note, why is Reddit's native video player absolute trash on the official Reddit app? I've been waiting for this video to load completely for ten minutes.
That's sweet
I didn't expect to cry so much today.
Two good boys.
My dogs been missing since October, theres nothing I want more than this moment :(
Well isn't that just the most beautiful thing you'll ever see. I cried like a bitch when my cat returned after 4 days, let alone 7 months and I'm 33. Wonderful stuff
Honestly this is my greatest fear. I don't know what I would do if my dog ever ran away. I probably wouldn't be able to function. I definitely wouldn't be able to sleep at night. The not knowing would bother me the most. Not knowing if my dog is hungry, if she's injured, if she's dead, if someone else took her in, if I would ever see her again. I think having a dog or cat run away is worse then having a pet die.
This story makes me feel good.

I saw a cat get run over a month or so ago. It was the most horrible thing I’ve seen because I knew it was someone’s family member. All I could think about is I hope the cat didn’t suffer and I am so sad a family won’t be having their family member come home. 

I’m glad this kitty found its way home and it was reunited.
Oh man, I can't handle this
My cat ran away 1 month ago :(
man i know that feeling, my cat was gone for about a year, it's amazing to have her back, any pet reunion makes me smile.
I'm not crying, you're crying.
I could watch these videos all day long.
Someone just threw a handful of sand in my eyes.
I forgot my antidepressants and this is too much for me rn
Wasn’t this just posted like last fucking week?
Yeah cats can leave some feels. I had my girl 21 years and man I can feel this kids emotions as I could imagine seeing her suddenly right now about 2 years later.
Beautiful
Reminds me of when my cat got out because my aunt is a terrible catsitter...
Our cat went missing for 4 months but I was away for 2 months before I saw her again. She was never that happy to be carried before that but when I came home she actually climbed me, tried to get on top of my head and wouldn't let me put her down. I miss her so much.
This is me every time I think my cat got out  and lost only to materialize hours later out of another dimension.
Backstory needed.
Stop filming you ass
He looked like Gibby
Lie down, 
Try not to cry,
Cry a hell lot
Never underestimate the power of pets and parents.
I was an emotional wreck when my cat was gone for just a little over a week. I can't imagine how hard it was for that kid.
Omg I love this so much! Kitty kisses are the best!!💕
My cat went missing for 3 days and I was devastated. I can't imagine what this boy is feeling. He has his buddy back 💛💛💛💛
Give me food hooman
This was me when my cat, Gandalf, was found 3 years later.

He's 13 now.
Was the cat lost? Was he away? What happened??
If my cat will be lost for a 7 months, then after reuniting he will shit my slippers...
now i want a cat
My cat got away for only a day and half
And I felt like I was in morning that whole time . Thank you for this video . I’m happy he has his cat back .
Holy shit. This is a special video. Animals are the best.
This legit made me cry I want to know why he was apart did he run away or what?
Awwww...  😍
Me in two weeks when I find the last Cadbury Cream Egg that feel behind something in the pantry.
That's love. I am so glad his kitty came back.
I hope these two live forever
To all of you who "adopt" that "stray", make sure you do your do diligence. There's someone out there freaking out because they lost their fur baby.
My heart can't handle this
that's me when I come home from work every day.
These are honestly my favorite kind of video
Me coming home to my cat after 1 day at work.
Oh my god, I know that feeling. Thanks for the warm fuzzies, buddy.
Awwwwwwwww ;___;
It would be cuter with out the crack head change my mind
They found him after he went to live on the farm
That cat and kid really love each other.
