What the fuck is wrong with your dog 
If that bear grabbed my butt, I would crap my pants, no no no thank you very much.

Hey how ya doing lil mama, let me whisper in ya ear
I know a bear could kill me pretty damn fast, and that it's a dicey relationship, but honestly, I get warm, fuzzy feelings from the idea of having a bear just walk up next to me and throw a companionable arm over my shoulder to stare out the window with me.  It's oddly domestic, somewhat romantic from the perspective of it being like an old couple who are comfortable with each other and the life they have.

I believe this is the full story. Quite unusual, but there it is.
I love how to me, bears standing up looks like a human with their pants hanging realllyyy low
I need context! So many questions!
Finding a place where I can buy new pajama pants.
I fear this gives people an unrealistic expectation of bears.
KIDS - bears will gladly eat you before even killing you. Stay away from bears 
Also, beats, bears, battlestar Galactica 
Bears have no right being this fucking adorable when they would literally de-flesh me without even breaking a sweat.

This reminds me of an old story I heard about a wild bear somewhere up in Canada. There was small town with an old saloon type bar. And one day a young bear walked down the main street right up to the place. People used to give it beers and it got used to people. Every evening the bear would go to the bar. Walk right inside and sit on a bar stool. The bartender would serve him beer and nuts. When asked if he thought it was safe. The owner said that as long as the bear was sitting at the bar the place was real peaceful. Not a single person dared to cause trouble. 
That's a big ass dog.
I have several questions 
We all saw how this bear took a friendly moment to sexually harass this man. What is his name so we can put him on blast and #metoo him
Hope that bear is actually showing love and not mistreated.

&#x200B;

Technically, any animal that is able to feel "emotions", can be conditioned to love or at least like a human. Like vicious Lions, Cheetas, and even Elephants and Gorillas were shown to be able to. Sadly, bears are mostly mistreated and violently conditioned to show "emotions" and act humanlike, like in zoos and as attractions. That is because true compassion and care, takes a lot of effort and work, to show up to this extent.

&#x200B;

Thats why I said I hope that this bear really "loves" the owners or its FP.
Now THAT’S a bear hug!
Points out of the window.   
"Do you see the wheelbarrow there?"   
"I carry my enormous balls with it"
Oh hell no
Nope. Not even for fake internet points. 
Not being critical here, but who keeps a grizzly as a pet? Seems insane. Is this in an animal sanctuary of some kind?
This bear is pretty smooth
Looks like me when I walk into the kitchen and my SO is making food...
Omg soooo cuttte
I don’t like where this is going
Is the bear scene from Annihilation everyone is so freaked out by? Doesn't seem that bad. 
That's a good pupper!
Until you accidentally spook him and he rips your arm off
I dunno man, the way the bear gives him a kiss behind the ear and casually slides it's hand down... They seem more than just friends. 

They're like; really good friends.
Chicago checking in.....can that thing hit a 43 yard field goal?
In Soviet Russia...
Every details freak me out. The claws, the hugs, the licking.... mmmmmm I can’t be relaxed. I can barely bear it. 
Brown bears are typically very timid, calm creatures. They don't want to kill unless they're hunting or to defend themselves or their cubs.

That being said, don't hug bears.
This is @svetlan.nko69 on Instagram. They are from Russia and they have two bears! One of them they take portraits with, it’s not the one in this video. It’s all so interesting to watch.

Bear: Watcha lookin at, human?

Human: I think there might be a bear out there.

Bear: What? A bear? What do bears look like?

Human: Well, they are about 7 feet tall, and 500 lbs, with big, sharp teeth and claws.

Bear: Oh, like these?

Human: *runs out of the room like Fred Flintstone*
Yeea slap that butt! 
I knew this would happen once we let gays get married /satire
I’ve gotta get me one of these 
This is literally the best thing I have ever seen
So if he raised the bear from when it was a cub, will the bear never attack him? Or can the bear snap any minute
i love bears❤️❤️
I was waiting for the bear to grab his ass...
Lmfao that bear got handsyy
This might be the cutest yet most horrifying thing I’ve ever seen.
That hand on shoulder though...

It's always fun and games until the human gets hurt or killed and the bear is put down.

Oh Canada.... even your bears are nice.

I feel like bears are opportunistically friendly. They're technically not social animals, living most of their lives alone, but seem to enjoy companionship when they're raised with it. And a lot of salmon is involved. 

Still don't want it for a pet. 
Dude imagine having a bear in your house, even if trained, and it snapping. Either because you told him no and he got upset, or because you guys were playing and he starts playing rough, like it happens with dogs. Then what? You play so rough you die? You let the bear rule your house because if you say no he'll rip your head off?? Please someone explain how this works because this is what I think everytime I watch a video of trained bears.

In all seriousness, how dangerous is this? 
No fucking way, man. When it comes down to it, that thing is a wild animal. It could, at any time, turn to that feral side and turn you into a meal no matter how intelligent or how domesticated it may be. Fuck. That.

I feel like bears are the universes cruel joke. They look so squishy and huggable, but they'll eat your face.
I think the ability to domesticate and befriend such a wide array of different animals is humanity's greatest ability. We're really good at it when we try hard enough.

How do you domesticate animals that are known to have Razer sharp claws and teeth? One accidental swipe and it's over right? 
.....and then the bear ate him.
Fuck me... No effing way in hell. How do people trust non-domesticated animals with their lives like that?

This is like that one video of a guy looking down the barrel of his gun to make sure it's clean. It won't go off this time, hopefully, but when it does you're gonna have a bad time.

Countdown to this guys death
Go ahead. Do as little as look the wrong way at this feller. HIS BOAH will fuck you up
So how does that guy keep the bear from murdering him to death? Does he just keep it constantly fed so the instinct to hunt never kicks in? Or does the bear have a genuine bond with the human and doesn't see him as a food source? 
Can we start calling bears “hug dogs”?
After seeing quite a few videos of tame bears, I've been wondering: would it be possible to domesticate bears like early humans did to wolves?
