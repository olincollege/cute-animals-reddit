She liked what her human was doing so much that she's teaching it to the new puppy too! How sweet <3

*edited because u/DRiVeL_ commented that the adult dog is probably a female :)
Makes me want to cry because I can't cuddle them both
“I dub thee Sir snuffles”
I like how he is awkward to start with but once he starts"  oh yes this is nice "
‘Explain your smolness.’
I heard somewhere else on Reddit that this kind of behavior is an expression of dominance. It's not to say that it wasn't expressed sweetly and gently, but it's a way of saying, "I'm your pack leader, little guy. Welcome. But I could fuck you up if I have to."
what type of dog is this?
r/gifsthatendtooearly
this is (one of many!) a Berner trait. They do this to express affection & get your attention. Mine does it to me from my backseat while I'm driving 😬
It really do be a dog pet dog world

BERNES MOUNTAIN DOGS ARE SO REGAL AND PERFECT
Wow Dog’s loved so much, it‘s expressing love in a human way by petting.
I love how he really had to concentrate and pull his tongue back in his mouth to get his petting hand (or paw) steady enough to do it haha
Dogs actually attempt to mimic humans petting them because they know it feels good, so that is likely what the older pupper is doing!! Dogs petting dogs... what a world we live in.
Sweet Bernese!!! ♥️♥️♥️

I used to have a Bernese... sweetest babies!

To me, it looks like bigger doggo says to little doggo *"OK, and these humans like doing this, when you get that from them, come close and they'll give you some treats."*
This is so sweet, dogs are the best!!
Look, this is what the humans do when they like you. And I do like you that much.
u/vredditshare
That behaviour was taught to it.
I wanna pet the shit outta both of them.
Thats a show of domination, not affection, the older dog is showing the pup hes the boss
The dog is like "this is what hoomans do and me really likes!"
It's a dog pet dog world out there ;)

I’ve watched at least a dozen times and I’m still smiling 😃
Bernese are the best dogs, my wife's dog is part Bernese we are sure and she is the sweetest biggest goof ever. And all the pures I've come across are the same.
This is exactly how I pet dogs... the confusion/hesitation in the beginning and the awkward but gentle pats

Today I'm your teacher Lil friend
dogs can pet other dogs!??!?!
Why do I hear someone in my head saying, “gentle.”
Did they learn that move from humans or did dogs always pet other dogs ????
I just lost my Bernese today, this definitely made me cry and miss her more. They are the sweetest dogs.
Vids too short
Is that sumo?
Awww ☺️
"I like it when hooman do it so I'll do it to you"
That’s not affection dumbass, it’s not a human it was probably hungry and eating it.
This made me smile so big. Thanks for the beautiful treat to brighten my day!

"see, the hoomans will to this thing, dint worry it feels great, here lemme show you"
That pup is going to be SO big!!
I want this doggo to pet me, too.
I would like to watch them interact for the rest of existence please.
Sooooo...
Can people PLEASE stop saying "this is such a bernadiner thing to to"?
Like, yea, sure, some dogs may have some predispositions; but his whole "reducing dogs to a stereotype" really pisses me off. Just like "pitbulls are the sweetest dogs"
No. Just no. It's about HOW YOU RAISE THEM! Again, some dogs may be more inclined to certain behaviour, but this focud on  their race is extremely wrong, counterproductive and harmful. Train your dogs right, give them lots of love and also discipline and they will be good. No need to be this... "racist"?

What breed of dog is this? :D
omg sooo sweet

Someday we are gonna genetically engineer dogs to be as smart as people and they will be better people than us.

Bernese Mt. Dogs are the best!  So affectionate!
My parents have a Bernedoodle and she does the paw wave to get you to come to her, then will drape her arm over you and just rest it there, as if she wants to cuddle and hold you close. It's the sweetest. I guess she gets that from her Bernese Mountain Dog side.
He's trying to pet him like a human but he's like "how do they pet without squish?"
"dis what my hoomans do to me when they love me so I do it to you"
Petting, right? I mean that's what it looks like to us.

I'd like to know the real reason the dog is doing this though. Is it trained to? Is it a dominance thing? I don't know. But I don't like to anthropomorphize animals. They think and behave differently from humans, but the behaviors can be easy to mistake for things we're used to seeing in ourselves. 

Why can't they just tell us what they're doing, damn it! Tell me, dog! What are you doing!
Buffering... calculating distance...
I do this to my son all the time.  Usually because his hair is sticking straight up and he's leaving for school.
Anthropomorphizing animals is what simpletons do. This is not a sign of affection in that dog's brain.
I first thought the puppi is a plush
