If anyone is interested, I used to follow this family on Instagram. The Russian Blues are called Xafi and Auri, and they have a brother called ErroltheCat. 

Definitely worth a look if you're on Insta and like cats.
r/attackeyes
Also teefies On vs Off
Ferocious hunter during the day. Cutie patootie at night.
Doesnt even look like the same cat xD
Cat on ecstasy
It's also the difference of a 18mm Lens vs 50mm (or more) lens
are the eyes photoshopped? The colour is too green
Light Mode and Dark Mode.
Cat on the left had a rough day, one on the left is on drugs
[Couldnt help myself](https://imgur.com/a/6DatlVh)
Or just seen something that's caught its interest?
My cat does this when he sees me sneakin up on em
So we’re not mentioning someone really cranked up the colour on these pics?
Gollum vs Smeagol
Why do people give their pets fake eye colors...
Never noticed my cats skull change shape between day and night.
Pic looks photoshoped as well.
Chin is different  left pick has more of a young cat shaped head, the inverted triangle while the right side one is in the upright triangle shape.
Also one looks chubby while the other doesn't. 
One shows fangs while the kther does not.
Seems a bit like BS to me.
Not the same cat and both cats had their picture taken during the day.
Predator or Pumpkin
I feel like this has meme potential.
Definitely not the same cat. The nose color is different, and the eyes are wider apart on the cat on the left.
So just to clarify. Not the same cat, not day vs night and photoshopped features.
Nope
This is your cat, this is your cat on nip.
Night eyes = Hunt mode/play time. Love it when my cats get like that I know it’s go time
Looks like it could be xafiandauri on instagram.
That is a good looking cat wow
Same cat eyes: Day Vs Catnip
[https://imgflip.com/i/4rqz5t](https://imgflip.com/i/4rqz5t)
It's amazing how different cats can look depending on their eyes.
Also, no food vs food 😅
That’s when you know the LSD kicked in
Ray tracing on and off
Predator or Pumpkin
Amazing! Looks almost like a completely different cat!
Nah, these are both hunting gazes

Left: Hunting for prey

Right: Hunting for humans to pet them to purrrfect relaxation
My cats eyes dilate like this all the time. It's a really cool effect.
Ironically the right picture is what your cat looks like when it does most of its murdering.
How do you get that picture? Light looks the same
Dayman/ Nightman
Cats ✍️ are ✍️ cuter ✍️ at ✍️ night ✍️ got it
That's how they get you
My sister says when the pupils are dilated like that the cat is in dumbass mode. Cause usually they’re about to do some dumbass shit.
My wife, before and after food.
This is like the methheads in my city
Beerus normally vs beerus when he sees earth food
Also, cats off catnip vs on catnip
Holy that's beautyful
That time I snorted addy
Using difference lenses/apertures will do that.
Those are two very different cats... Right?
LEFT:  Sees bag of Friskies.

RIGHT:  Sees can of albacore tuna.
Funny how night cat loses weight too
Are you sure? These look like two totally different cats to me
Is this the same cat though?
Silly mode: activated!

Yeah my Siberian husky eyes look so beautiful when he’s out in the sun
Attack mode vs Cuddle mode
Sly and sinister

vs

Cute and innocent
Ironically it's the less aggressive looking night one that they use to hunt. That's why you get stories of eye glowing in the dark, light bounces off the fully exposed reflective backing of the eye.
Meth
In reverse: Dr Meowkyll & Meowster (and Moewssus...?) Run-and-Hyde.

The right one is called the Fluffy Mode. Very successful to get treats.
Evil vs Good

Cute and cuddly at night but look like a deadly snake during the day.
Day cat, Fighter of the nightcat, champion of the Sun.  He's a master of karate and friendship for everyone
Note to self: keep lights off to intensify cuteness.
My god, what a beauty!!

Beerus vs Meowth
 So at night cats just become a Dreamwork Animation version of themselves
Jaffa orange eyes....Half moon....full moon...eeeee I'm crackers me

This is the reason they can see at night.

Creepy Vs cute
Vicious killer vs cute kitty 🤪
First picture is snake eyes! Second is a fluffy baby

Apex predator vs cuddly beat friend
I love looking into my cats eyes and seeing how they change based on what is currently peaking their interest.

Evil Lord - Adorable
The completely dilated pupil of the feline, affectionately called, "dumbass mode".
Angel vs demon cat
Woah, like night and day
Those eyes are so beautiful!
Cool
My norwegian forest cat does this instantly when she's getting ready to attack your hand or toy. It's crazy looking when her eyes just suddenly turn black and her butt starts the wagging.
Why is it whenever they have those eyes to the right they always want to fight me.
Night? On the right photo it seems the cat took to much Methylphenidate.

Team Crazy Cat Eyes, that’s a fact. 🙃
That's a meme
Cheeks get fat in night?
Me going into work Vs me booting up my PC when I get home.

Scary VS adorable
Pretty eyes
From f/22 to f/1.0.
This is a meme temple if I've ever seen one.
The lonely kitty frees his mind at night
Wow, makes sense as to why they see much better than us at night. I imagine same thing for owls and other nighttime hunters.
Gollum v Smeagol
LOVE!!!$$
Is it some kind of gremlin or ..?
nice
The one on left wants scratchins, the one on the right is about to slice off your finger
Same cat eyes, same cat channel.
So this is what a cat on drugs looks like.
•_• -> O~O
He got chonkier at night
Are these your cats?
Gorgeous!
the picture on the left looks like a fukin wild predator
No-regular and *catnip*
Day vs night eyes but it's the same lighting in both pictures?
Wow so pretty
That’s called normal and dumbass mode
Looks like Smeagol
With all the pets and scritches in between.
Gremlins Night vs Day
Different camera lens. Maybe 100mm on the first, 50 on the second....

Oh Russian Blues - the most beautiful cat in the world and they know it!
It’s very dark in the second picture
Loses weight overnight
Crazy mode activated
Im guessing the cat is more of a night person?
sick predator eyes
The difference is day and night
Small image adjustments to make him look less menacing in the 2nd photo. Meh
No that's annoyed v. playing
Its called light vs dark
no catnip vs high
At day: you want pain?
At night: let’s fix this, i can’t lose you.
Oh. I read somewhere that when we like someone our pupils dialete. I wonder if that's why I'm perceiving the right picture as more friendly.
Those are the eyes are on the right are prepared of the zoomies in 3...2...1
Two different cats...
Same cat, when feeding dry vs wet food.
Hahah it's like humans at work and humans at home
it's also different focal lengths, making it's face look different
My cat's eyes dilate like that any time she's playing at any time of day.
Lonely stoner cat seems to free his mind at night
I think you have a gremlin
Same eyes sure but is it the same cat?
f32 vs f1.2
If your cat has eyes as wide as that...run.
My sister told me that cats eyes turn into a vertical line at noon.. true or nah?
Ninja clock
Like a gremlin
Could use the same pics for before and after catnip
Idk what to think of this. Seemed like the title is suggesting it’s the same cat. But clearly several of the features are different to make left look “scary” and right look “cute”.
The green in those eyes looks photoshopped.
Truly a marvel of nature
Haha, I too am not a morning person.
*humming Frank Sinatra Night and Day*
Its funny that it looks like Attack Eyes / Cute Eyes but it's actually the other way around.
Cats have such evil eyes
When the mushrooms kick in
Witcher!
r/tightpussy
This is your cat, this is your cat on nip.
Same cat eyes: No acid vs acid
Those look more like “before and after” Xmas dinner pics to me
That's why you shouldn't trust your cat
Why is the entire shape of the cats head different
The one of the right is fucking terrifying
He just hate the day haha
This is Baron from Neko No Onkaeshi (The Cat Returns). Maybe his brother? Such a handsome fella!
I think you mean relax mode vs. attack mode! Butt sway inc. after the eyes on the right!
Villain in a Disney cartoon, hero in a Disney cartoon.

Cats are great
What a beautiful cat. And that's from a dog person
His face is a bit fuller love it
Predator mode
Dumbass mode engaged
Cat probably sees the world in anamorphic during day due to the oval aperture
Same cat though?
The face got rounder at night?
Left= guardian of the underworld

Right=Mr fluffles
Filthy hobbitses
f22 vs f1.4
I'll eat your soul vs. I'll lick you.
i call bs
Is it the camera lens and angle difference that make the nose look different? The cats muzzle looks so different to me
did 'em dirty in the first pic
It's like a reverse gremlin.
Also the shorter, closed mouth at night makes this image not biased at all.
Before molly, after molly
Hungry vs playful
Really hope they're not using a flash when its pupils are open like that. It's damaging to them over time. There was a harbor seal the tourists around here permanently blinded due to constant flash photography over a few years as well. I personally don't use flash when taking pics of my cats.
The difference really is day and night
Looks more chonk on the right
Even the face looks different/ crazy!
Those are two different cats
Platinum Tonkinese? I had two (siblings). Most personality I've ever experienced in cats. Adored them.
Voldemort | Potter
A heroin kitty vs meth kitty
This is 2 different cats.
why did the cat also gain 5 pounds
 I love animals, they cheer up and bring love to our world, you had a bad day and they cheer you up, thanks to nature for such lovely friends
When cereal havent milk VS when cereal have milk
That’s my name!
Asking for:

1. Blood

2: cuddles
Predator / Owwwn
The reason for this is because just like ours ,cat eyes dilate so in the night they have to be able to absorb more light.
r/supermodelcats ¦ r/Catsmirin
How did their face get CHUBBIER?? so cute love it
Dumbass mode engaged
Not the same cat. Lol
Just like me when i take some molly..
am I weird to relate it to Tom?
So same eyes different cat?
( left ) F 22 vs F 1.4 ( right )  , best way to show different aperture settings are cat’s eyes
# "Beast and the Beauty"!
You forgot to add that the right one is more fed and groomed
Such a pretty green
Or calm vs. Not
After pets before pets
Left: Attack Mode

Right: Adorable Mode
Vivid color
this feels like /r/InstagramReality haha 

those cheek bones tho
The day picture likes like it was taken when the cat had just woken up
Cat’s eyes dilate when their fear increases. Sometimes when my cat hears a sound, you can no longer see the color of her eyes haha
Awhhhh 🥺
Awhhhh
Correction, day vs attack mode.
I’ve never seen a cat with such vibrant eyes!!!!
When you touch ice cream of your girl Vs when you buy her favourite ice cream
The interesting thing from a photographic point of view is that the pictures show the opposite of what the cat's vision is seeing. Smaller aperture shows wider depth of field (less blurring) while wider aperture increases light gathering it causes small depth of field so more precise focusing is needed.  
Gorgeous cat/eyes and great pics!
Off catnip vs on catnip
Love Those Eyes
So there is a new magic camera APP for cats?science is good thing 😳
*before caffe and after caffe*
We've a cat that has blue eyes, I thought they were red for months because I NEVER saw them constricted, they were ALWAYS dilated beyond reason, completely obliterating the iris.
Those are two completely different cats, the other one is clearly under the influence of drugs.
kitty has good aperture control.
It's fake right?
Because in the other pic the cat is fat.
It looks like you gave him acid lol
Before and after giving 100% attention.
awwwww

Comment #666. 👹
Pretty sure  This isnt the same cat. Whiskers and markings are different - as well as facial structure amd the color of the noses. Maybe I’m wrong- but I’m going with 2 kitties here. Not doubting their eyes do this , just doubting its the same pair of eyes. Beautiful kitties!
From demon goblin to baby
Saw this post at \~7:30am in California. Comback here to see it in r/all. The power of commenting early is strong here.
Which day or night
mew
Is that the same cat?
They’re cuter at night, but day they look like predators. Except for me cause they’re always predators for basically a piece of bird, like me.
Before and after skooma
The eyes may be the same, yet the cats seems kinda different)
Why it looks chubbier at night •_•
Highly evolved apex predator vs. cuddly snookums

Beautiful eyes
Night: Hunter/Cuter Mode Activated
Can change view in light and day
awhhhh thats so cuteeee
No red dot, Red dot.
Also, different camera lens.
Different focal length, too. That’s why the facial features are more “squished” on the right.
“Hey what time is it?”

*Pulls out cat from my back pocket and stares directly into its eyes*

“It’s uhhhhh 6pm”
Beautiful eyeballs.
It's like a gremlin and mogwai
just realised cats dilated eyes looks like asari mind melding
Drugs vs no drugs
Left is bright light and right is hunting mode
So beautiful ❤️
Your cat appears to have gained weight from day to night. Fascinating
Ah yes, dumbass mode ENGAGED

Left: Instagram pic with filters
Me on photos vs me on the mirror
Day vs play
stop letting your cat lick hypnotoad.
My eyes do the same thing cause I get high at night
These are different cats...
Beautiful by day, cute by night
I oddly think the two cats are similar but the not the same exact cat for some reason... maybe a picture of a pure breed cat couple? There are some slight differences that don't look like it's just because one is actually looking at something surpising.
Wouldn’t that flash be a lot for the cats eyes fully dilated?
he go from 😠 to 😳
Before and after taking MDMA
This is crazy. Filters?
heroin vs cocaine
Puss in boots vibes
Why does the fur look different?
Did she become even more chonky by night?

Nightime: Silly Boy

Everyone who thinks they have a russian blue cat, this is what they actually look like.
Mine always has night eyes then.
Nie wyszukej imię kota HP lovekrafta na googlie 🤯😱😱😱😱😱
opiods vs amphetimines
I’d totally wouldn’t adopt at night
Didn’t know my cat has eyes. He is asleep all day.
The one on the right looks like they're from an animated movie.
Cool af
Since when does their bone structure change too
Before and after I shake the dreamies box
Funny thing, my blue russian cat gets crazy at night and I always have said his eyes were like he was possessed by the devil or drugged lol
Daycat, fighter of the Nightcat
The difference really is night and day :O
Different cats and different focal length lenses.
Yeah..No

I dont trust them
different camera lens also makes a huge difference
Gollum vs Sméagol
Funny cats and kittens meow
  Follow u/kittiesnmore3d to increase the empire of the cat on the internet. Kitties deserve to rule every corner of the internet. Lets make that happen.
Not the same day, but ok.
Day and night difference.
Left side wants scratches, right side mean "get the fuck out before he starts menacing stuff"
Not just day and night, looks to be different moods too which creates an even bigger difference. Cat on the left has teeth showing and eyes are narrowed slightly.
Those green eyes are fucking sick
So cool
I have never seen a cat with green eyes... This is incredible
Looks like different focal lengths too: https://i.imgur.com/7Vzdcn7.gifv
The eyes on the right are because it’s focusing on something like a toy, basically “hunter mode” turned on. Not night eyes. Why can Reddit never understand cats.
Also different focal lengths from the look of it.
Different cats. One on left is skinny af. Patterns in the ears are different.
And a different lens OR zoom
Not even the same cat.
Those are the most beautiful cat eyes I’ve ever seen!
That is so adorable!!!!
It's amazing how different the cat looks. On the left, quite threatening, like the predator she is. On the right, almost babylike.
I’d be willing to bet the eye color is photoshopped and I’m also 70% sure this isn’t even the same cat in both pics
Sorry don’t think so
Nobody has said they are the same cat,just the same cats eyes. As in eyes of the same breed.
Right: I’ll have her home by 9 sir
Left: she calls me daddy too
You mean one cat is on weed andother speed?
