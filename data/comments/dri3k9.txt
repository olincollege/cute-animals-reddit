okay okay thats beautiful go away and let me be grumpy again now
In Navajo culture, whoever makes a baby laugh for the first time hosts a celebration.  I love that!
Just wait until she tells her first joke I remember my daughters. 
"Knock knock"
"Who's there?"
"Butts!!!"
Our infant turns five months today. About a month, month and a half ago my wife’s friend was playing with him on his play mat and tickling him. He started cracking up and he’s never done that before. My wife and I were stunned. 

Since then it was become our life’s mission to make him laugh. We realized last week we can toss him and he loves it. I got a scream laugh two days ago and it’s my favorite thing of all time.
You almost sound like an Italian chef lmao

“You make-a mama cry!”
I've got a 6 day old newborn and cannot wait till I can make her laugh!
I don't have kids and likely never will, but they've really started to grow on me lately. A few weeks ago I spent time with a friend and her little one, who has refused to eat green beans yet. At dinner I looked him in the eye and ate my beans in a silly way while laughing, then he grabbed one of his own and did the same. Ate four whole beans! It felt awesome.

Watching this video was the same. I want to hold babies and make them laugh.
“When the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies.”  J.M. Barrie
I just stretched out my arms to my two kids and said "hey! Who wants to give dad a hug?" And they both got up and ran out of the room.
As a background for those of you without kids.

The first several months of a kids life they are a worm  that eats, shits and cries. They keep you from sleeping for months and meanwhile they have no personalities. They just stare blankly ahead, eat, shit and cry.

It is hell.

Then one day like 4 months in, they look at you and smile. Maybe they laugh. They stop being a worm and start being a beautiful tiny human. And it's all worth it.
Thanks for brightening my Monday morning!!!!
You got both those girls' hearts for life my friend.
RIP my ovaries
Admittedly, I usually scroll right past kid videos (I can’t, and prob wouldn’t want to, have children. Guess I avoid anything that might make me like them more). This one though...this got me. Damn you for my teary eyes but thank you for posting such joy. Your wife and baby seem wonderful.
This is so cute.. I could feel the love! congrats on your beautiful family my friend 👨‍👩‍👧
I get that cry on a personal level. Motherhood isn't easy, it downright sucks a bit from time to time . . . but that first legit giggle?? It just refills your heart, and makes you want to do everything to illicit that magical sound over and over. 

If they could bottle up baby laughter, I'm sure it could be more useful than any SSRI!
The mother's reaction is absolutely priceless!
Can this just be the news for the week? Like no more impeachment updates or looming war in the middle east...just baby laughs this week.
That first laugh is so sweet. She just lights up every time with her big belly laugh... music to a mother’s ear. I’ve never forgotten the first time I ever heard my baby boys laughter... sweet honey.
Baby looks just like mama.
Man, this makes me (M25) so excited to have kids. Also gives me the drive to work hard so I can be ready. Thanks for posting :)
In the Navajo tradition you owe baby a big party! It’s good luck to be the first person who makes a baby laugh, but then you have to throw a huge party (and cook tons of food). So people try to get out of babysitting duties around 3-4 months so they’re not stuck with all the time and expense of putting on this huge event. The whole idea is that a baby is still partially living in the spirit world, but when they laugh for the first time it’s because they’ve decided to stay with us in our world. I wish I had known about this when my son was that age, I think it’s so lovely. Plus my husband owes us a party! ❤️

This made my Monday so much better already. Thanks OP
Holy shit, we gotta save the future of the planet for this little girl.

Dad: "you're making your mama cry! " 
Baby loughts "oh, it is just the beginning!"
I remember that feeling as a parent. No better sound in life than a baby's giggle.
r/ContagiousLaughter
this must be the purest video I have even seen!
This is such an amazingly pure and joyful moment. So much happiness. Congratulations!!
It's so weird to see private moments on the internet like this
r/HappyMarriages
Your wife is absolutely lovely!
Your wife and your child are both very beautiful
That is quite possibly the cutest baby I've ever seen.

And I've been on the internet for a while.
Baby laughs are the best laughs.
No better feeling then hearing a baby laugh. 💯
I love this age. Baby giggles are the best.
I think the first smile and laugh really take it from “pink  soft jelly bean” to “OMG tiny human”
Parent Fact:  It not possible to not laugh when your baby laughs.
I needed this today! Mom and baby is so adorable!!!❤❤❤❤
This is so cute
Wholesome
r/mademesmile
The laughter of a baby is the best thing in the world
Aww this made my day! Your wife and baby are both adorable!
I needed something wholesome today. Here, take my upvote while I wipe my eyes....
Awww she so cute what a beautiful family 🙏
Hi Andy!
I love that age. I can't wait to have grandkids. I almost cry every time I think of them and they don't even exist yet.
I hate to be negative, but your daughter really should not be wearing that necklace. Its a choking hazard. Baby and and wife are adorable though.
Is he Italian?😄
THIS IS SO DAMN WHOLESOME
Lack of sleep is a hell of a thing. There's a reason they use it as torture.
That's one hella cute baby.
Beautiful.
Oh man, that first laugh is the best.
This may be the purest video on the internet.
Soak it in. Baby laughs are perfect.
Your wife and your daughter are truly beautiful, have my best wishes sir
Oh man!! Mine just started to chuckle, I can’t wait for the full blown laugh!!!!! 🥰
There is nothing more wonderful than a baby laughing! Adorable video! Thank you for posting.
They say that babies just copy their parents, but I don't believe it. Laughter comes from within, a trait unique to our species. I remember when my son was small and I got food poisoning. I was throwing up into a bucket and he went into peals of giggles. He certainly wasn't copying me! He thought I was playing some game, to be funny, so the more I vomited the more he laughed. I assure you I was NOT laughing at the time. It was spontaneous; a sense of humor comes from within, and when a baby first laughs it is magic.
Nothing can fill your heart with more joy than hearing your child’s laugh. It’s the best
Your wife and baby are gorgeous mate. Congrats! Such a wonderful moment. Thanks for sharing!
It's hard to understand unless you've raised an infant, but this moment feels unreal. This is a creature that has thus far only taken. Babies don't consistently smile, they don't hug you or say thank you or even often acknowledge you exist other than to give them milk. This moment is that first little glimmer of human interaction that suggests maybe this little creature actually notices you're there, and maybe they even enjoy you.
Now I'm crying and laughing at a woman crying and laughing at a baby laughing.  So sweet!  Beautiful family!
This is so sweet! Number one rule, dads are always funny!
You just made a lonely old lady very happy by sharing this. There are times in life when we need a reminder of what really matters. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
This does put a smile on my face.....
I don’t have a maternal bone in my body but damn, I can’t even begin to imagine the feeling of hearing your baby laugh for the first time.  This got me in the FEELS.
Both mom and baby are adorable
I should call my mom
That is truly the best sound in the world. I uglycried so damn hard when both my kiddows laughed the first time. I never knew that I could feel so much love by just hearing someone laugh ❤
Is that a man or woman takling? The true genderless voice.
Your daughter is beautiful
My husband loves toddlers/young children but thinks babies are ugly since they haven't grown into a lot of their features yet. I have a feeling he'll feel completely different and turn into a big teddy bear when we have our first child.
I love this bebby laugh. It's so raw and natural.
Oh the happy emotions! Positive payback for that long wait and horrible labor!
Hoop ear rings and a nose ring around a baby? I see you like to live dangerously
I absolutely lost it when my friends baby clapped for the first time in front of me... My friends laughed at me but it was the most beautiful sound and sight ever.
r/mademesmile
This is the most wholesome shit I'll see all day.

r/eyebleach worthy.
My eldest laughed for the first time in a Perkins bathroom. It’s one of the best memories ever. 
This video made me well up a little. Damn onions.
Now I'm crying, too! First day of daycare for my 3 month old :'(
Shes just so goddamn happy that something came out of it that isnt crying or poop.
Adorable x 2
You got a beautiful family right there.

User name checks out.
Best sound ever! Love the first laugh!
You have a beautiful family.  I wish I had your good fortune.  The first time I tried to make my baby daughter laugh, she heckled me.
Is that a giant phone?
Your wife’s expression is exactly how I felt too! Our daughter laughed for the first time in her sleep, just as she was dozing off. It took a couple weeks but we finally got it on video with our phone but it’s one of the greatest sounds in the world.
I used to get annoyed by the insufferable comments parents would make before I became a parent. For the most part, I still do. I get it, but damn some people take it way too far. It's a personal choice (hopefully). I'm cool with people either way.
There is seriously nothing better than a baby’s laughter
Baby laughs are the best sound in the world.
Baby laughs are a goddamn drug.
Marvelous. Love to this sweet baby and mother. ❤️
>How will I ever stop?

From Dad to Dad--you never will. I didn't realize until I became a parent that my own Dad wasn't naturally making a complete jackass of himself; he realized his role was to make us laugh and did whatever it took. You've joined a great club--welcome!
Enjoy it! Teen years will be here faster than you think and you will dream of the days when you had a little baby in your arms.
A baby, but particularly your own, laughing is about the most beautiful thing to behold.
I honestly don’t know who’s cuter.
My first baby just turned 1 and I still remember her first laugh.
one of my favorite sounds ever. My kids are in their 20's now and I still totally love that sound.
Aw, such a cute little baby, those eyes are just gorgeous!
So cute! I remember when my sisters were that small c:
It may be trite to say but there is seriously NOTHING more pure than a baby laughing.
Very cute baby girl, wish for happiness...
This has to be one of the most precious things I’ve ever seen on this subreddit and that says a lot
What a bunch of cuties
This video just gives me such a visceral feeling, like that's my kid and I'm experiencing that for the first time myself
When my son laughed for the first time, I cried. Been Mak n him laugh ever since!
Cute
This made me happy cry too. So fucking sweet!!!!
my wife had the same reaction! One of the best moments so far..
One of the most magical moments as a parent IMO.  The other is watching them be amazed by things we take for granted.
Most beautiful sound in the world. My daughter's first smile and cry echo in my mind every day.
There is nothing more beautiful than hearing a baby giggle.  Of course, if you dont have a baby or there isnt one in the house, I guess there is nothing more creepy than hearing a baby giggle.
Well, this made me cry.
That. Was. Beautiful.
I'd love to know what it is that makes babies laugh, like what they are actually finding funny in that moment. Its always the weirdest stuff that sets them off.
Watching this on mute (at work) and still laughing my ass off at the happiness. Laughing babies are dope AF
Thank you for this
This really is the most magical feeling ever. Our little girl is 6 and a half months old, she's our first child and everything is new, everything is amazing, but hearing her laugh tops the lot. 

...and I'm going to enjoy it whilst it lasts, because right now she finds me hilarious. I've got many years to come of being embarrassing/delivering Dad jokes, so right now I'm loving the fact that she thinks I'm the best stand up comedian around.
Happy crying in lecture this morning. Don’t know why, but this was exactly what I needed to see today. Thanks for putting good into the world
I have a four month old boy who laughs in a very similar way. It is the **beeeeeeeeeeeest**.
I was worried he was gonna run out of things to say
First time my daughter laughed my wife and I did the same thing haha
This is by far the cutest but I had to send it to friends and family because your wife is my twin in this Universe and it was bugging me out!!!
Portraits of a happy family. God bless y’all
We have a 7 week old that is just starting to smile a lot. It's adorable. Sometimes she'll do some light giggles in her sleep. I'm so PUMPED for her to actually start laughing.
My boyfriend was not a baby person at all. We used to watch my baby twin cousins all the time when the were infants and I said just wait until you hear them laugh, it is the best thing ever. Those little shits didnt start laughing until they were over 6 months old, i was so mad. Luckily he fell in love with them anyway and they were the cutest things anyways.
as a crying laugher myself i love seeing other people laugh cry!
Oh god this made me so happy. How old is she? She’s so tiny!
This is so cute! <3
Omg, don’t cry, I’m going to cry too! This is the best thing to hear, ever!
Your wife is cute, OP. You should wife her!
Its been 27 years and my mom is still waiting for me to laugh
Username checks out
Dad saw her laugh two days ago and has kept it a secret so mom don't get mad.
Babies man. That feeling you get when they laugh for the first time is the best
Precious..Such a blessing to be able to capture these moments on film, this time like no other time in history were able to catalog each moment of our lives that surprises us...I just read an article About a father who every year on his little girls birthday videotaped himself dancing with her, on her wedding day he played the clip of the 25 birthdays, just a great idea. Many blessings to you and your family
This is so touching.
I was at work when my son laughed for the first time. He was mimicking my wife making an "MMMMMMMMmmmm" sound when suddenly he just started chuckling. Thankfully she was taking video at the time so she sent it to me. I ran around the office showing anyone who would look.
This is a healing video
Yea.. definitely the best thing in the world
Baby laughs are the best. My lady and I recently had our first and know exactly what this mom is feeling.
Remindme! 1 day
Too cute! That's soooooo adorable! And to think the little one is going to grow up and live into the 22nd century. Whoa...
You have a pretty family.
Baby giggles are the best.  They just get better.
That is so freaking cute, and so are your wife and child.
Lol, yeah that was pretty much my reaction to the first time my babies laughed. It's such a beautiful sound you just don't ever want it to stop. 💗
I can't decide if your daughter or your wife is more adorable!!
This is one of the most adorable vids I have ever seen, and I don't even like babies all that much! Love the bow on her head, love her smile, and love that laugh! So precious!
Pro tip: That's the moment they trick you into having a second one.
Both momma and baby were absolutely adorable
Tiny baby or massive phone
I hope you were handsomely rewarded.
:45 those eyes just scream "Holy fuck this moment is ACTUALLY happening" can't fake that.
You have a buetiful wife and baby
What an incredibly beautiful pair! OP, you are a very lucky person!
So absolutely adorable beautiful baby and wife. :)
Your wife is gorgeous.
This video is THE rebuttal to all the grumpy whining people do, talking 'bout how we're all recording stuff with our phones too much, and not "living in the moment."

This video will be a precious artifact for this family, for generations. That baby's great-great-grandchildren will be able to see this.

That is fucking AMAZING. 

And that baby, herself? She will have this utterly priceless piece of her own mother to hold onto, after she's gone. A high definition, perfectly-in-focus, preserved moment in time, when she was young and joyous, and bonding with her child. 

For fuck's sake, you can actually see the tears of joy trickling down her cheeks. That is simply astonishing, when you think about it. People from the pre-photography days would be envious beyond all description.

Don't anybody *dare* tell me they should have put the phone away and lived in the moment. They lived it, and they captured it for all time.
Dammit now I’m stuck in the office restroom with my face like my momma died or something
This is so sweet, not much more sweet then baby giggles.
My husband and I are waiting impatiently for our very smiley 6-month old to laugh. I will definitely react like this when she finally does! What a joyous moment!
I'm pregnant with our first child and sobbing at this at work
I remember the first time my daughter laughed. You get the existential punch to the gut that you've contributed to the creation of this living creature, and now its undeniably evident that its self aware, and has it's own opinion of what's going on. It's both horrifying and astonishingly beautiful at the same time.

That's adorable.

P.S. am I the only one who continues to struggle with v.reddit?
Shit... I have baby feaver now.
Awe her happy tears
Das very cute
I can remember the first time I heard my daughter laugh!! A defining moment in my life...!!

Simply magical!!
One of the purest forms of joy in my life so far is hearing my first child's first laugh.
What a beautiful child and wife
Sweetest fucking sound in the world, that is
that was the most wholesome light hearted thing ive seen. thank you for brightening my day
Hormones are one hell of a drug. 

But cute.
I’m so happy for you and your wife! That first laugh is the best feeling. You’ve spent 9 months dealing with pregnancy, you can’t sleep, you might be sick, you’re definitely uncomfortable. Then the birth is super hard and you’re exhausted from that. THEN you have to take care of a tiny helpless infant, it’s a thankless job. All they do is cry, you can’t sleep for longer than 2 hours at a time. 

Then suddenly they learn to smile and laugh, and it feels like they are saying they love and appreciate you, and it really helps
\#ImNotCryingYoureCrying! amazing clip
I am a father myself, and I have been around lot my friends and families babies. This kid one of the most adorable I have ever seen.
The best sound in the world!
I wish I can have a baby
Thats adorable!!!
This has to be the sweetest video I've seen in a long time. 

You'r done lucky man to have chosen such a wonderful wife and mother and that baby will have an lifetime of laughter with the two of you!
Best music ever.
Baby laughs are the best.
Where is the person speaking from? They seem to have a light accent, can’t quite pin it down.
r/contagiouslaughter
This is so wholesome
Thank you for this <3
Made me cry - she is adorable. I remember my sons first laugh!
I have never seen a happier person in my entire life.
Every babys laugh sound the same.  I have a video of each of my 4 children laughing when they were babies and all sounded the same. Just like your baby.
Savor the moment. It passes in a blink of an eye.
Ok so you guys owe me a a new cutneness-omemeter. Damn thing broke when this video played.
My baby laughed for the first time the other day, and I had the same reaction. I am sobbing at how sweet this is.
You're all incredibly adorable and I can't stop watching this! Thanks for making us smile :)
One of the best sounds in the world!
I’m crying because I’ll never experience this
Absolutely beautiful moment, child and wife. That first year is rough, but these little moments make it bearable. 

When mine were that young, older folks would say "Appreciate this time. You'll miss it when it's gone." and I'd glare at them groggily with a massive bag of diapers, bottles and receiving blankets hanging from one shoulder and a baby attempting to tear off my ear in the other arm... thinking "You've just forgotten 70% of this time." 

I was right, but so we're they.
I can FEEL this video. 

The first laugh is seriously one of the best sounds a momma will hear, that and the first time you hear the heartbeat while pregnant. Makes your heart explode and gets you all warm inside.
Such a sweet moment! You’re family is very lucky!
this will be me lolol
Just had this same experience today! Best feeling in the world!
That is one cute baby.
That's so beautiful. Thanks for brightening my day.
Baby laughs are the best thing in the world! Hope you enjoy many more lovely laughs!!
I completely understand this. When I heard my daughter laugh for the first time I teared up myself. 

Since then I make sure to make her laugh everyday. She's 2 and it's the best sound in the world to me.
I love your wife, and not in a creepy, sexual way.  That made me happy.
I needed this more than I ever knew. Made my whole day better.
One of the best sounds in the world! Love it
Awwwe I love it
This is what I want in my life.
i thoroughly enjoyed this
This made my day, as I’m sure it had for the poster’s wife. Laughter is truly the best medicine, especially when heard for the first time from a beloved you’d wish would soon show such wild, innocent gratitude. 😊
Well I just cried like a lot.  This is so heartwarming OP!  Your baby and wife are both just wonderful
This honestly made my morning. Thank you 😊
god bless your family.
I prefer when animals are posted here.
My boy (young man 15 going to be 16 soon)

When he was 3-4 months old I was changing him on the floor & I ran my beard over his chubby little belly & he shivered & started giggling.
I did it over & over again. 

My mother in law was laughing at me because I was crying with joy over my boys first giggles.
I still have that amazing memory to hold onto when he is a grumpy moody teen. 

Your daughters giggles are amazing & your wife's reactions are precious.
I don’t get the big deal over babies
i must be the only one here who absolutely does not want kids, i'll let myself out now
This is so cute. I've cried right along your wife.
My heart grew 3 sizes this day. Thanks for sharing.
Amazing how one video on the internet can change your bad Monday.
That has just made me so happy.  I recently split from my wife and felt like I had lost everything this video has brought back some sunshine.
cute
Giggly..
This is so sweet! I remember my son (who is now almost 18!!!) was around your daughter's age and somehow found the word "chicken" hilarious. For a few weeks we'd say the word and get a huge belly laugh. :D
r/mademesmile
Awww that is so cute! I’ve been told by a lot of friends and parents that hearing their baby’s first laugh is the most heartmelting moment they can experience. Lots of love!
Yep, I lost it too.
Anyone else find his voice very annoying?
Precious
All of that is beautiful!

Thank you!
Literally can’t help but to smile too.
[deleted]
Jeez women are emotional. Cry over anything.
I love baby laughs, they are so pure and prescious. it isn't until they are 5 or 6 and learn to fake laugh, until then, nothing but pure happy laughs. :D 

awesome capture!
Oh my fucking brovaries! That adorable little thing
Your wife kinda looks like Emilia Clarke
Dude babies are fuckin stupid those aren't even real jokes. I for one didn't find them funny in the slightest!
This is so pure!!
Awe... this is precious.
The first time a baby laughs is definitely the first time a baby laughs
This has brought light to my life thank you
This is the most precious thing I’ll see today.  The mom laugh crying is the best.
Why do people put those stupid bows on their kids head?
The baby looks just like a mini me mom
Sounds like a squeaker lol
[deleted]
You my friend, are one very fortunate man.  Cheers and much laughter to you and yours.
This is damn precious!
Thanks for the laugh. I needed that. What an angel!
Well, that was adorable af. Laughing so hard, you're in tears.
What a wonderfully beautiful way to brighten a grim, grey Monday morning.
I absolutely love children's laughter. So pure and squeaky!
Oh boy! (or girl) I sure needed this!
What a wonderful, happy family. Congratulations to all of you.
I swear the world stopped spinning on its axis the first time my kid did this. One of the most joyous moments of my life.
Being a parent must be hard on the nerves
I love this so much!!!  Thank you!
I am currently trying to get my little one to laugh for the first time.  
There is nothing that can compare to that sound!!
Thank you for sharing this, the best sound ever.
I still remember the night my 8 month old girl laughed for the first time. Wife and I were arguing and her little giggle made us completely forget about the argument. Made us realized how much we enjoy being first time parents
Aw this is Amazing, Beautiful family. There really is nothing else like the love of a Mother
This is so beautiful. Thanks for sharing it.
It's enough to make a grown man cry...and that's ok..
I’M CRYING TOOOO
There's a billion babies and they all usually laugh at some point.  Get over it.
Awwwwwww
This brought a joyous tear to my cold heartless eyes. Guess I’m not a psycho after all.
😍😍 Baby laughter never gets old!!
The baby is so adorable. Such an innocent smile
My 4 month old just laughed for the first time 2 weeks ago.  She scared herself at what weird noise just came outa her then got super serious.  Laughing is serious buisness apparently
Do not attempt to make a happy baby happier.
Oh my heart. I can’t wait to have that moment some day!
This is wonderful!  Good luck on the journey!

My rugrat is just over 1.5 years now.  Was a fun weekend with a timechange here and him being sick.   Ugh.


But it's all so worth it!
this is the sweetest.
that baby is super cute
The joy of being a mother.
Gold!!!!
A couple times a week my mind wanders to "what if" when it comes to children. I absolutely love and adore all my nieces and nephews, but it never happened for me. (Never really dug into it either, to see what the issue was/is). But seeing moments like this make my heart just absolutely overflow with love and admiration. Tiny little humans are just absolutely incredible in every way. Still dunno what the future holds for me tho. Kudos to yall.
I can’t decide which of them is cuter! Bless you, new mama!
My daughter is a month old and I cried when she first actually smiled not just the smile reflex. Now she smiles all the time. I cannot wait for her to laugh.
My dog lost it too because she sounds like a squeaky toy ❤️
Brings tears to my eyes. Possibly because I’ll never have either of those things that truly give life meaning.
The little bow is too cute.
Those giggle bursts are the best and always happen at the most random moments but when they do you just keep repeating what you did/said cause it’s working. 

Love this video.
You guys are not the only ones crying...
The love of a Mother is undeniably beautiful!
This made me tear up with joy, I cannot wait to experience the one a million opportunity of being a mother! ♥️
Sitting here holding my 14 day old daughter and I can’t wait for the baby giggles!! ❤️
Hah. I love the bow.
good monday start!
I love you so much!

*laughs*
That was beautiful. Now I'm tearing up at work.
I'm in the same boat as op....our 3month was caught laughing. Cutest thing ever.
Thanks for the laughs cute one. I needed this.
What a lovely expression and what a lovely moment.
It's so magical enjoy it :) they dont stay tiny forever.
As a father of two soon to be three her laughing and crying is so relatable. Shit. It’s like a cry of pure love. Months of frustration and unbearable heart warming love.
This is so **wholesome**, holy shit.
I like how babies are either perpetually terrified, or :D
My wife had the *EXACT* same reaction when our daughter first laughed!
So cute
Thank you for this.
r/mademesmile
Baby laughs are one of the purest things in the universe.
Beautiful stuff, thank you for sharing.
this makes me (:
Is your wife laughing and crying at the same time?
r/contagiouslaughter
Hope in humanity restored.
There’s something so pure about a child’s laughter.
Little bean!
That was totally me, when my daughter laughed the first time. It's so wonderful :)
Most infectious laughter ever! Thanks for sharing
I'm 9 months pregnant, ready to pop, and this made me bawl lol i can't wait to hear my boy laugh.
Who’s cutting onions?
Absolutely adorable!!!
That is absolutely adorable!  Such a mega-cute baby! This gave me a big smile- I needed this today. Thank you :)
Awe that baby looks so cute
My doggo zooming around the living room got my boy to laugh for his first time. It was awesome.
Awesome, made my day!
My son laughed for the first time the other day, and it took my breath away. It was the sweetest sound I have ever heard.
This makes me so happy. My daughter/first child is due this week. I can’t wait for moments like this!
How old is the cute tiny human?
Baby laugh is best laugh but I can't tell what she's laughing at
Baby smiles change the world. Baby laughs are almost like a drug. They are amazing.
That's so amazing
Good lord this is wholesome
I was a stay at home dad for the first three years of my daughters life.  Not ashamed to admit I cried when she did many firsts.  Also mad respect for the stay at home moms out there.  I understand.
I almost cried too so wonderful!
This was too cute
[This makes me feel good...](https://pics.me.me/when-youre-meme-scrolling-and-you-keep-running-into-inspirational-32011598.png)
That moment when they change from baby blob to human being lol
What a beautiful moment! Thank you for sharing! :)
This will be a great video to show your baby when she grows up, great bonding moment
How sweet 🥺
Omg congrats!! Wait for them terrible 3s
Straight up awesome and it will just get better and better.   My daughter is now 7 and I'm constantly amazed at her.   I remember the very first kiss that she gave me :)
I did the same thing when my little one laughed for the first time. There was laughter and tears. Was the sweetest thing. He’s six now, but that first laugh echoes in my head still.
My baby girl had her first laugh last month. It's amazing how good it makes you feel!!
Nothing like that first baby laugh 😭
my ovaries exploded watching this. ADORABLE
I know the feeling
Baby laughter is something so pure
The amount of pure joy and love in this video is wonderful
This is exactly why i wish i had a little sibling
One of the millions of reasons kids are great!  Thanks for sharing!
A very beautiful moment

The payback for all the sleepless nights. Best reward ever invented by nature!!! :))
Oh man, I'm crying. I remember when my daughter laughed like that for the first time. She was with her dad and my dad on the other side of the house, I was folding laundry. I heard something that sounded like her crying, so being a new mom, I rushed over in full mama tiger mode. She was hysterically laughing at our dog, who had just sniffed her face. I pulled out my phone and started recording, and she kept laughing at the dog. I cherish the video and most of all, the dog. What a good boy
Awesome. My kid is five and I still feel the same way. It’s a magical sound to hear.
Awww🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I really wasnt ready to be crying like that
A baby’s laughter is the cutest sound in the world unless you’re alone at home
So sweet! especially mom's reaction is awesome.
she laughs like a squeak toy 😂
My wife’s exact reaction a week ago for this. So cool when they finally laugh
Aww so cute!
How old?  Our newborn is 2 months today.  Can’t wait!!!
The baby went like: ah ah ha hah ahaha hahah ha ha hahahaa ah     ahahaha hahaha haha ha
What a beautiful moment to have record of. I remember feeling something similar when my first niece laughed or was happy. It’s so weird that your eyes just water up because of how happy you are.
Congrats man. Cute baby.
This is so amazingly precious. I just cannot wait to have this kind of life one day😭
Mom's are the best. No one will ever love you like your mom does.

Momma's be mothering.
Welcome to earth! You have a lovely family and I hope that laughter is the center of your home always. You can make it through anything with a good sense of humor and a supportive family around you. Congrats. You are extremely wealthy.
Babies laughing is the best sound in the world! I would record my baby laughing on the Handy-cam so that we'd never forget that wonderful sound. Must find the tape today and watch it!
So adorable.
What a lovely heartfelt family moment, glad I could observe it.
I'm 24 and single right now, and planned on having kids with my previous partner but since separating have edged more and more closely to deciding I may not have any of my own.

And then videos like this just absolutely warm my heart and make me want to find someone to have kids with and it throws a complete spanner in! I do get broody a lot though, and although I'm still young and have a lot of time, it's something I think about a lot.
Incredible! Thank you for sharing this special moment for the parents and adorable child.
Awww this is so cute
This is adorable
Baby laughs are like medicine for the soul. I have so many videos on my phone of my son laughing that non-parents probably think I’m nuts.
What age is this
Well that makes it worth it.
Oh my gosh! She is so adorable. She reminds of my niece, she's such a happy baby!
i hope you find it
How many times through the story of life have moments like these repeated themselves?  And most were lost to time...
Baby laughter is the most wonderful music.
I love this so much. Such a cute kid.
First off, this is adorable and so pure. Secondly, she's laughing at your terrible Travolta voice. Third, good job making such a cute baby.
What this phenomena is called when tear comes with the ecstatic laugh?
My HEART
Love it. Nothing more beautiful. Mines 2.5 months. And just on the verge of laughing. Cant wait.
They are so beautiful... cherish them like they are your lifeline man. May they be blessed with all their hearts’ wishes
Hope I get to experience this, one day.
I currently have a one month old. Have been struggling through the sleepless nights, but this video gave me so much to look forward to. Thank you!

One of the most beautiful sounds you will ever hear. My son just did this last week. Absolutely heart melting to know that you can bring so much joy to somebody.
This is heartwarming
That is so sweet!!
I have a video similar to this of my daughter when she was 4 months old.  My wife is tickling her with a little stuffed animal and my daughter is going bonkers because she’s laughing so hard.  I can have the worse day in my entire life but go back and watch that 30 second video and it brightens my day up every time.  Those nights of diapers, crying and sleeping are over.  We are in the “No” stage right now and let me tell you it’s fun.  But at the end of the day when I pick her up from daycare she ALWAYS runs to me screaming, “DADDY DADDY DADDY”........Best....Feeling.....Ever!
Be still, my heart. So dang cuttte!
Something to live for...
That's awesome :)  I remember when my daughter first laughed at one of my jokes, it was amazing
That phone sure looks big in front of the baby
My son just started laughing a few weeks ago, it makes me so happy! Except at night I don’t like waking up to laughter in the dark....
/u/vredditdownloader
So sweet. Her little hands. agh the tears 😭
I love this!!! And I can totally relate! 😭😭😭
This is what I pay my internet bills for.
This is just too wholesome for the internet
Where do I buy this?
I never wanted a child. Now I’m not so sure....
This is Beautiful!
My son is soooo close to laughing! I love these moments
it’s been a rough day. thanks for this, it really brightened my day
My 8 week old is trying his best:)
awesome, congrats, enjoy it!
Alternate title: What extreme sleep deprivation will do to you.
I will always remember when my mother got my nephew's first laugh. She started crying and it was just...magical.
Your poor wife is gonna pass out if she doesn't breathe soon.
Beautiful kid, man. Congrats to you and your family!
16 years later, parents trynna get their boots out the kids ass from kicking it out the house
How old is the baby? My wife gets frustrated ours has laughed like twice. Then she gets scared he is having developmental issues.
Already laughing at your tears. Perfect lol
Post partum hormones are a helluva drug. Laughing and crying at the same time is very common, so I found.
I’ll never forget the first time my baby laughed. It was one of the best moments of my life. I’m so happy for you both that you caught this on video.
It quickly became my favourite sound in the world. Nothing makes me cheer up and make me smile more then when I can make my little girl laugh.
Hey I recognize that! That's the wobbly tearful joy of a sleep-deprived new mama!
This is absolutely fucking adorable
cute dimples!!! I'll let Reddit sort it out
thats beautiful :)
Op, your voice sounds EXACTLY like mine
So dang cute
That is the purest thing I've ever seen
I am 18 so I don't know how you parents feel when your baby does something for the first time. But I remember holding my lil sis for the first time and I still remember it like yesterday how small, fragile and cute she was. Though it was like 14 yrs ago.

Moments like these are so special. Hard to describe the emotion we as parents feel when stuff like this happens but man it makes you feel so fortunate to have a child.
Oh man, I needed this today.  Thank you.  It's lovely.
My heart just grew three times its size.
That's awesome.
 so beautiful!

I remember the first time my son (now 2) laughed. It was the happiest moment of my entire life. He looked up at me and gave a little chuckle. I laughed back and he just started laughing and laughing. It was wonderful.
I want this happiness so badly. Love to you and your family ❤️
That was amazing. Reminded me of the first time my daughter laughed like that. Thank you.
I definitely didn’t cry from watching this. At all.
Wait until she (she?) sees a roadrunner cartoon for the first time, especially if you wait for a couple of years. We had two boys, two years apart, and they saw these together for the first time. We had no idea that kids could laugh that hard and deeply. One factor is that they were 3 and 5 at the time, and both had seen enough silly things and things bumping into one another that they just lost it when they saw these cartoons.
Enjoy that beautiful family dude.
Holy mother of God I needed this today. Thank you for this
I did the same thing when my baby laughed!! 😭😂
Oh my heart..
oh my god this is so precious. Im so happy for her
This is beautiful.  As a dad of 20+ yr olds, please take the time to enjoy and cherish these times .. they honestly grow sooo fast.  Work/job can go to hell. Enjoy your kids.
So adorable.
Irresistible, so cute.
Beautiful
I cried laughing the first time I heard my baby laugh too. Such an incredible feeling. I still get teary eyed when I see her having a lot of fun
This is really sweet.
This is a blessed video. My 14 month old watched this video and giggles non-stop about 12 times in a row, and he's been a stuffy nosed grump lately. Thank you for spreading your baby's joy.
What an amazing moment you captured.  Personally, I found your accent quite likeable!  I don't see what is so funny about it.
Awww this make me all warm & fuzzy 💓
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen!
Hello
I learned two weeks ago that I'm pregnant with our first... can't even tell you how emotional this video makes me. Congratulations on your beautiful family!!
This is the cutest thing I've seen in a while! 

Laughing babies are so great! But your wife cracking up is what's really making me smile. Totally wholesome. 

Congrats on the little one!
This is too sweet for my pregnant self to handle 💕
Honestly things like this is what is keeps me going in life and gives me hope that one day I might get to have these moments myself. Thanks for sharing
This is fucking adorable!
made me smile and cry too. :’) this is so precious
This makes me want to be a mom so badly
/u/vredditshare
My little girl is almost 5 months old...my wife and I are so looking forward to this
i cant tell if its a woman or man making her laugh
Damm was I confused at first! I thought the title said that your wife “lost a bet.”

Huh?
Awww
Baby social media is probably super hype but I’m old enough to enjoy it. I feel like once I have a kid I’ll fuck with it more
Babys are the best
Awesome! I would stop taking precious videos in portrait mode though.
I miss this so much :(
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve ever seen, thank you internet
She sounds like a squeaky toy! 😍
I love making my baby girl laugh like crazy! Baby laughs are the best!!
Oh my god, my boy is 6.5 weeks old and I just can’t wait for this. Made me tear up.
The birth of a fairy right there!
Damn already fishing for complements.
☺️
That’s so cute
My ovaries 😭
I love baby giggles

My 12 mo old still does it!
Awwww even I have tears shes so cute!!!
Halrious
Best thing I've seen on the internet today!
I’m so excited to be able to have children. Thats a looong ways away because I’m 13 though lol. But I’ve always wanted to have wanted to be able to have a child. I understand there’s hard work to be put in it, but when I’m an adult, and have a husband, and can give a child a good stable life, I’ll sure as heck be doing that. Videos like this make so happy and so excited for the future.   My mom was such an amazing mother, she had 11 children and you’d expect after that many she’d be sick of kids. No, she still loves them so much and she’s a grandmother now to my sisters kids. I know a Reddit comment section isn’t the best place for cheesy stuff, but I really wanna be just like my mom. Maybe not with as many children, but just be a loving mother who doesn’t judge her children’s mistakes, but helps them. Its so great seeing videos like this, children are a blessing. Even if they cry a lot, shit their pants a lot, or even if they’re teenagers and are awfully snarky. I don’t know why I wrote this whole thing lol, I should probably just have fun being a teenager before thinking so much about the future.
This is to wholesome
I'm tearing up at this. Those first months are so hard and i hope you all have an infinite amount of laugh crys in the future. ♡
Who knew talking like Mario was the key to laughter
This is literally the most adorable thing in the world you’ve made my whole freaking week thank you for sharing this.
So sweet to see it..
Such simple pleasures are what life is all about.💞
That was the sweetest thing I've seen in a really long time! Thank you!
That is beautiful.
This is so wholesome
Is that a oneplus?
NO I'm not crying.... You Crying ! For me it's just because I want to wash my eyes
Username checks out.
Omg she sounds like my son lol
Sleep deprivation is a hell of a drug
Good old rewired mom brain. 

Both terrifying to loose part of your partner to infant bonding, but also beautiful to see.  

To have a child together is to know... Life changes, and you still love each other, while some priorities change your love created this new life and your new life together. Life moves forward. 💖

Either enjoy it or don’t. I’d choose to enjoy it. 😊🙏🏻
