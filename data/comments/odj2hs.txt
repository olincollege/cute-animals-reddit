My husband proposed this way! Only problem was our cat has never worn a collar and was having no part of it. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why he was chasing him around the apartment freaking out and told him to leave the damn cat alone. Little did I know Milo was pawing at the collar trying to fling it off and my husband was scared the ring was going to come off and get lost. The cat wouldn‚Äôt stay with me long enough for me to notice the ring so my husband put him in the carrier and put it on my lap so he was contained.  Getting the ring off once I had noticed it was just as much of a chore.
This is how I proposed as well but with a puppy. It took forever for her to find the ring since she was so excited about the puppy I kept telling her I already named her if that‚Äôs okay and she just kept hugging the puppy without looking at the collar. Then she finally did and it started a whole new scene of excitement and emotions 10/10 would do it again but this is the only time!
I would like to think he proposed and the ring is on the collar of the kitten cause what better way to tie the knot than a kitten and ring combo.
This guy knows what he's doing.

Trying the old "hold a kitten up while you confess to all the bad stuff you did" gambit. Works most of the time.
How do you think he measured the cat to make sure it fits her finger?
‚ÄúPlease accept this sacrifice as a symbol of my love‚Äù
That‚Äôs the vet giving her the bill!!
Lol that's how I did it :)
Will you be my crazy cat lady? Hahahaha
We have a winner here üî•
Will you marry this kitten?
Sweetening the deal.  ‚ÄúWill you marry me?‚Äù  ‚ÄúUhh, I dunno‚Ä¶‚Äù. Whips out kitten.  ‚ÄúHow about NOW?‚Äù
I call my female cat my engagement present. I had to work the day we could take her home from the shelter. My (now) husband stopped by and brought me some lunch since where I work is close to the shelter. During lunch he was acting real twitchy and strange. He said he was just worried about having enough time to pick up the cat. It didn‚Äôt make sense, but I let it go as it was his first time adopting an animal and I thought he was just anxious. Turns out he went to buy my engagement ring prior to picking up the cat at the shelter. When we did our engagement photos we actually brought the cat along and took pictures of him proposing to my with her. We loved those pictures so much they became our save the dates.
She really said "POG"
This is the best purrrrrposal I‚Äôve ever seen
Looks like he‚Äòs trying to feed her the cat
Will you Meow-re me?
She really hit that man with a poggers
This is the only way I'm going to react like a normal person when getting posed to. Ring: oh yeah this is nice sure. Kitten: omg (shocked face) no way (ugly crying) yes yes a million times yes.
I will also accept an engagement puppy in lieu of the kitten.

This looks like Jack Johnson proposing to and older Pam from the Office.
Excuse me, I need to go tell my fianc√© to propose again. Properly.
I proposed in bed, after a nice date I was going to do it in this nice restaurant but the food was not that good also I didn't want to put her on the spot so I ended up keeping it in my pocket, and I put the ring under my pillow and purposed while we were cuddling. It was nice

The only proper way to propose to a crazy cat person.
Hey this is at Animal Friends in Pittsburgh! Saw it on their Instagram.
this proposal took place at a really awesome shelter called Animal Friends in Pittsburgh, PA! it's one of the best shelters I've ever been to! I just thought they deserve the shout out!!
Can I say yes to the kitten and no to meowage?
We rescued our cat from the shelter. The guy who had to give him up got him to propose to his girlfriend. They told us that he had a bow around his neck with the ring to surprise her when she got home from work. Turns out she was extremely allergic! She said yes to the ring and no to the cat.
It's one thing to plan a romantic dinner..a weekend away and pop the question...but while adopting a kitten at a shelter totally off guard and wow a kitty and a ring ...= win win

..to propaws?
Will you meowry me?
My ex did this when he proposed to me. My new kitten had a ring tied to his collar.
Will you meowy me?
"Will mew marry me"
You had me at meow
I just hope he said ‚ÄúWill you meowy me‚Äù
That cat is way too young to be getting married
Oh hey that's a viking proposal. Instead of jewelry, vikings would offer their bride a kitten. I don't remember why a kitten, but that's not important.
Am I the only one who doesn't understand what is going on?
Will you MEOW-y me? ü•∫
This is how my fiance proposed too, only it was with one of our dogs....who we'd had for several months.

Earlier that morning, my boyfriend made a comment in which he referred to me as his wife, and I teasingly corrected him that he hadn't yet asked, and I hadn't answered. About 15 mins later, he mutters, "I can't take it anymore..." and walks out of the room. I'm, of course, very confused....until he comes back carrying our dog, Azurah, and gets down on one knee.

Personally, I think it *is* the best way to propose, cuz who in their right mind is gonna say "no" to THAT CUTE WIDDLE FACE???? ü•∞
I just got my partner a lambkin kitten (we needed something hypoallergenic) as an engagement present.  He LOVES cats but never had one of his very own. We just took her home yesterday.  Hes happy lol but I've been up hard the night watching her cause she's so tiny.
Cuute, reminds me of a scene from Taylor Swift's single ME! feat Brendon Urie. Taylor had the very same reaction when Brendon proposed to her with a lil kitty! I believe that cat is now her pet :)
Would probably get a "yes" from me. üíç < üò∫
It‚Äôs supposed to be one CARAT not one CAT! Sheesh!
This would be me but with a puppy üê∂ üòç
This is going to be a great first picture in the wedding scrapbook.
Actually she's appalled because he said that if she didn't marry him he would strangle the kitten
"Remember, you're not marrying me...you're marrying this cute fluffy kitten...Don't look at me...look at the kitten...look at the kitten, Janice."
I love proposal pictures where the woman is *so* happy and surprised, she almost looks furious at the same time!
Here honey, put your finger in this...
So help me if he didn‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúWill you mewy me?‚Äù
Kinda cruel to the kitten though. I mean she's gonna have to wear her until they marry so...
 cute picture.  made me laugh
I hope the guy had a dog named Will so he could be like ‚Äúnow it‚Äôs just Will, you, marry, me‚Äù
Its purrpose!!!
Will you meowy me?
I usually never comment on stuff like this but without knowing them he seems like a good guy based on him concocting such a proposal. Good for them!
‚ÄúSay ‚Äòyes‚Äô or the cat gets it‚Äù
Just figured out how the other half is going to make sure we get another fucking cat when the current two pass on
PURR-POSE
I did the same! We rescued a kitten, and I put the ring around its tail. She definitely wasn‚Äôt expecting it.
In her last book, Anne Lamott said that when her current husband proposed, she made a stipulation that she would marry him if they could get a kitten.  So they did.
‚ÄúWill you meowrry me?‚Äù
Darling I think we should separate but here's a parting gift
Yes. This is the perfect way to propose. You get a pet and a hubby/wife
Does this work with 2 pound lizards
You can propose to me with a cat.  
I don't want an expensive engagement ring.
Say yes or  this kitten gets it.
She'll marry the cat, not you.
Fuck it, if I get married I'm proposing with a cat.
Engagement kitty!
This is how I did it, but with a guinea pig. The little bastard didn't want to sit still.

For me, it's the cat feet in the background that just brings the whole tableau together.
Will you be my kitty momma?
I would have said yes. I asked my husband to marry me, but I didn't get him a puppy.
Cat: You can purrt me down now sir
I thought he was breaking up with her and is giving her a ‚Äòcrazy old cat lady‚Äô starter kit.
What a great pic. Dude looks totally in love and lady looks like she just won the lottery.
I love this
It‚Äôs a commitment kitten!
I don‚Äôt think this is a proposal. The Women looks like she‚Äôs at a PetsMart or an Animal shelter of some kind and The guy looks like he works there. Khaki shorts, casual polo/style shirt. Looks like he‚Äôs presenting her with a cat that maybe might‚Äôve been an exact resemblance to a cat she may have lost some time ago. Hence the reaction on her face.

Gosh I gotta get outside more & touch some grass. ü•¥
I don't think he proposed, I think he requested something really dirty related to what the cats called.
Will you kittens with me?
At this point a pet is more of a commitment than marriage
Going to need my husband to propose again.
Feels a little like bribery/extortion. This appears to be a shelter so the message is, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs something cute and fuzzy that you like. If you say yes, we‚Äôre going to take it home. If you say no, no kitten.‚Äù

I know he‚Äôs not saying it, but at the same time, he is.
She‚Äôs allergic
Every way is the correct way to propose
I'm such a cornball I'm actually crying!
Will you meowarry me?

He is not proposing. This is a special needs care giver introducing a emotional therapy cat to his client.  OP has a great imagination and decided to embellish to get more karma.
No that‚Äôs a horrible way to propose, when the animal dies it‚Äôs extra sad because it was a symbol of engagement.
"With this cat, I, thee wed.."

I'm hoping my punctuation was within reason. Little help if not, thanks.

Twist: she's allergic to cats and it just never came up before.
Will you meow-ry me?
is this a proposal or did he just confess to cheating on her and is offering a kitten to forget about it
Would you marry or the kitty gets it
I'd marry anyone who would propose like that, including Kim Jong-un.
Like this cat, our love shall never die.
"Would you mewry me?"

I feel like the kitten is the ring because
GF ‚ÄúCan we get a kitten?‚Äù

I don't like cats, but that cat has probably got some reservations about the whole scenario. And can you imagine if the cat flipped it's pyscho switch at the moment it was near her face?

So my now husband did something close to this. But not really.

So I had a feeling he was going to propose. Wasn‚Äôt sure when, how, or whatever. We talked about marriage and he already knew my answer. 

Well we lived in a area that flooded a lot. One day I came home from work during lunch on a Friday. He was working from home. I saw this kitty outside limping about. He was totally going to die. He couldn‚Äôt run away from me when I walked by. Just skin and bones. It had flooded recently and forecast to flood any day now. So I was like hey there‚Äôs a kitty outside basically dying. If I go downstairs and can catch him, can we keep him until he‚Äôs good enough to walk again? Thinking there‚Äôs no way he would take in a cat the weekend he was going to propose to me. So I go ‚Äúcatch‚Äù the kitty. He couldn‚Äôt run. Bring him upstairs. We feed him and put him in a box with a lot of towels. There‚Äôs no way he would be proposing and taking in a kitty. Well the following Sunday he proposed! Five years later we are married with 2 five year old kitties!
