He derped right off the bed!
I had a ferret, his name was Ky. Although he smelled sooooo bad! He was such a cheeky little shithead. He used to hide in the couch wait for people to sit and bite their bums from the cracks! Then run out from the couch jump on my lap and jump like this ferret in the video as if to say “ Did you see me!?! I did good !?! “ loved that dude.
At the end "what have I dooooooone"
I love how they dance when they're excited!
Zoomies, ferret-style.
What do you mean a derping ferret? This looks like completely normal ferret behaviour to me 😆
Cute little war dance
What was the tube
I don't think I will get tired ilof this video
It’s called a “war dance” and is a sign that the ferret is having an awesome time! I have a ferret (Ferret Bueller) and he is hilarious!

My buddy had a ferret growing up. Can't remember his name but he didn't stink and was condensed mischief. I distinctly remember hitting the bong in his basement one time, and the little bugger managed to scoop all the bud out of the baggie AND douse it in a glass of water he knocked over. I just sat there watching and laughing my ass off through the haze of smoke. Friends were non too thrilled about it

If your ferrets have been destunk, you change their litter daily, and keep them properly groomed, it’s no more stinky than having a dog you bathe weekly. I owned one and have a keen nose.

Ferrets are hilarious but also disgusting. They smell horrible. And their poop isn't pellets like other small fuzzy animals. Even Dog's poop is normally fairly solid.
