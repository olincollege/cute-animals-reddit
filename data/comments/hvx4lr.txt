like a fox with high heels
This is a Maned Wolf. However, it is neither a fox nor a wolf. It is the only species in the genus known as Chrysocyon.
There's a Brazilian biologist that used to work for Nat Geo if I'm correct that he made a series of videos in this exact same location about these "Lobos Guar√°s" (Maned Wolf).
We're looking here at a monastery in the middle of a thick jungle, far away from any city.
These wolves are extremely afraid of any interaction and noise so they appear 99% of the time during the late late night when there's no one around, pick some food out of the box and go eat alone in the forest.
To be there and film it you must agree with some things, one I believe is that you can't make any movements or noises when these animals get near you, because it has been a long time for the monks to get these lobo's trust and a loud noise or someone getting up from their benches could put everything to an end.
Also, they like to eat a strange fruit that for us and almost every other animals tastes bad.

Yes you say by this video that they are super gentle and delicate, and you're right, the Lobo Guar√° indicates how healthy the area they live in is, once they get stressed out pretty easily and will not mate or eat and just die of sadness.
I view them as forest spirits for their connection with the jungle's health.

Please feel free to correct me below and sorry for my english.
Extremely tall and gentle foxes, these wolves are.
Fun fact - they are the only member of the canid family that walk with their legs moving together, i.e., both left legs move forward while both right legs stay planted, then left legs plant and right legs move forward.
This looks like it is equal parts fox, hyena, and horse
That's the weirdest horse I've ever seen.
They tried to put him on the cover of Vogue but his legs were too long
So elegant.
I don't care what you tell me, that there is a forest spirit.
Ya gotta be kidding. And we dont think aliens made this shit ? It's a deer a fox and a wolf genetically mashed together.
'Are you wearing the...'

-The chanel boots? Yes. Yes, I am
Ah.  So this is where my corgi's legs went!
Fun fact about Maned Wolves, they have a very distinct smell.  The smell if VERY similar to marijuana.  I worked at a zoo for a summer that had them, and the guests were always coming to tell me someone was smoking pot by the Maned Wolf habitat, and I had to explain to them that they actually just smell that way.
Have you heard them bark!?

so much leg
I have been there and it‚Äôs awesome. You can give meat to the wolf. It‚Äôs called Santu√°rio do Cara√ßa in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
I love these guys. They're like the giraffes of the canine family. Or maybe moose.
Him rainforest puppy.
Reading through some of the comments, i think should clarify some misconceptions a lot of people seems to have here.

**Are Maned Wolves endangered species?**  
No, [Maned wolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maned_wolf) are not endangered species. They are hard to spot because they simply just avoid contact with humans (altough they are friendly in nature).

&#x200B;

**Do they live on Rainforests?**  
Nope, they live mostly on grasslands, prairies and shrublands ([cerrado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado), transition areas berween Cerrado, [Caatinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caatinga) and Amazon, etc). They normally avoid the lowlands of [Pantanal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantanal) and rainforests.

**Is this dude a wolf, a fox or both?**  
Neither. The maned wolf (*Chrysocyon brachyurus*) is a unique species. It is the only member of the *Chrysocyon* genus.

**Is the deforestation a danger to the maned wolf?**  
No, it is actually doing the inverse. Although i am against deforestation, it is a fact that it actually helped spread the maned wolf through south america (that does NOT mean, in any way, we should keep fucking up our forests, as there are other creatures that needs them for survival).

EDIT: Typos n' shit
Why is this so eerie?
Raw bones = good, 
Cooked bones = bad
Ah the famous foxhyenaelk.
He gots boots on
A unique and stunning animal- there are 3 at the San Diego zoo- if you go when the zoo first opens, you can see them walking around. So unusual yet graceful
Brazil, even the wolves look like supermodels
Don‚Äôt feed him chicken bones tho... don‚Äôt want him to suffocate
Why does this look like Nala and Banzai been messing around and had a kid
I like how she tosses out the bones lol. ‚ÄúNope!‚Äù
Long legs doggo
We have a pair of maned wolves at our local zoo. 
They hide in the back of their enclosure so much that I hadn‚Äôt actually ever seen one until this past fall. 

Up to that point my sister and I had a running theory that it was a fake exhibit because no one we knew had ever seen the wolves either.
Nah dude, thats an animal straight out of Avatar the last airbender
That is literally one of the most beautiful animals I have ever seen. It looks like something pulled from a Studio Ghibli movie or fantasy game.
absolute derp of a wolf, I love him
Their piss smells like marijuana.
Gorgeous.
Looks like a Fox had sex with a horse.
Looks like a fox that attempted to become a giraffe, began at the legs but canceled right before the neck was about to grow.
That's a fucking pokemon.
Stupid name, this looks like a fox mixed with a hyena. It has no mane and it‚Äôs not a wolf
I‚Äôm gonna call you hyenafox.
Never feed any animal cooked poultry. It has a high chance of sheering and causing internal damage.
The [maned wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maned_wolf) is the largest canid of South America. It is the only species in the genus Chrysocyon (meaning "golden dog").

Although the maned wolf displays many fox-like characteristics, it is not closely related to foxes. It is neither a fox nor a wolf. 

The term Maned wolf, as the Crin Wolf in Spanish, is an allusion to the mane of the nape. It is known locally as aguar√° guaz√∫ (meaning "large fox" in the Guarani language), or kalak in the Toba Qom language, lobo de crin, lobo de los esteros, or lobo colorado, and lobo-guar√° in Brazil. The term lobo, "wolf", originates from the Latin lupus. Guar√° and aguar√° originated from tupi-guarani agoa'r√°, "by the fuzz". It also is called borochi in Bolivia.

One study based on DNA evidence showed that the extinct genus Dusicyon, comprising the Falkland Islands wolf and its mainland relative, was the most closely related species to the maned wolf in historical times, and that about seven million years ago it shared a common ancestor with that genus.

The maned wolf is not closely related to any other living canid. It is not a fox, wolf, coyote, dog, or jackal, but a distinct canid, though.
leggy boi
It‚Äôs so cute ü•∫üíï
Woah he is alll legs!
How odd. It's like a wolf crossed with both a fox and a gazelle.
Major props to that fox that fucked the deer. Just the sheer logistics of it must be impressive.
"maned wolf at brazilian drug mansion fed fucking cooked chicken bones that will splinter"
Coyote fox deer
Yep, feed it cooked bones... 

That‚Äôs just internal injury waiting to happen for this animal.
Dat Wolf walks up there like a Supermodel in a Paris fashion show
Doggy long legs
thats my wife WHY IS SHE THERE

IS SHE CHEATING ON ME
LEGS!
If you‚Äôve never heard a maned wolf [bark](https://youtu.be/oBSGEl-yB7A) it‚Äôs pretty crazy.
I dub thee MooseFox.
What a magnificent creature.

Thank you for posting this - I love nature and its not every day I get to discover an animal that I didn't even know existed.
He comes, he eats, he leaves..
The maned wolf is the largest canid of South America. Its markings resemble those of foxes, but it is neither a fox nor a wolf. It is the only species in the genus Chrysocyon. It is the largest canid in South America, with a weight between 20 and 30 kg, and reaches up to 90 cm at the withers.
Reminds me of Princess Mononoke. In other words; "This is like one of my Japanese Animes."
The folf
If a wolf, fox, and hyena were combined.
Look at them ears
Professor? Professor Lupin?
It looks like an hybrid between a wolf, a fox, a coyote, and a pinch of hyena
Wow.  I always knew they were long legged, but seeing them in comparison to those sitting people, they could be the size of a small pony!
Looks like a mix of fox hyena and Tasmanian wolf?
i saw the maned wolf poop once while walking on a forest reserve
Look at those leeeeegs
Something about the legs that just..creeps me out.
 Aguar√° guaz√∫ !
Al Gore here, manbearpig is no longer a concern, we must divert all attention to this foxhyenawolf!
It looks like a hyena fox.
Ok, I can understand where some of the urban legends based around wolves come from. Jesus that thing is huge
Woah, it looks like a cryptid
##notallfoxes

That‚Äôs no tall foxes, mind you.
I just thought that one character which has a telegram sticker where they‚Äôre standing tall with their legs and the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù
It starts out as an easy meal of meat on a tray, next thing you know your kids are Maned Puggle Wolves.
That is a Lycanroc.
Watch out for professor Lupin
See? There's cool things in brazil too
Looks like a red fox and hyena. Very cool animals!
I thought it was a big Hyena at first
As Charlie said , ‚Äú it looks like a stripper, but for wolves.‚Äù
#notallfoxes
Everything about this animal says "I'm better than you"
That‚Äôs one tall fox.
/u/vredditshare
My survival instincts just went to -50.

Wanna put my face in its fur.
that‚Äôs a shiny coyote you can‚Äôt fool me
They are native to my state fauna, but I never seen one of them outside of a zoo. They are really shy. I mean, I even saw a Jaguar once at my grandpa‚Äôs farm, but maned wolves are very reclusive, I guess.
That is one weird mufuckin cross breed.
Oh look... it's..... a...... hyena-fox with giraffe legs...
Are you feeding it bones?
One of the most beautiful animals in the world.
I love how some of the common names are random ‚Äúmaned wolf‚Äù. Because it‚Äôs the ‚Äúmane‚Äù that‚Äòs the most distinctive characteristic. Nothing else comes as differentiating from any other candide you‚Äôve ever seen, but if you look closely, you might notice a mane. Ignore stilts for legs and the fact it looks like a giant fox; focus on the MANE....
Here in europe we call them  T A L L  F O X
Is that...? Are you wearing the-
Chanel boots? :) yes, I am. :)
 TIL why Vulpix is named Vulpix
Leggy Boi
An Aguar√° Guaz√∫, theres plenty of them in Argentina and Paraguay too. They're that tall to walk over ponds and small rivers.
That appears more Vulpine that Canine. do they just call it a wolf because its so big? looks like a fox that adapted to live in a swamp (this is based on NO research lol)

&#x200B;

wiki said its neither fox nor wolf, but its own thing. but it is indeed a canid
It's not manned, it's completely autonomous
that creature freaks me out
Can‚Äôt fool me with that Hyena-Fox.
Beautiful, never heard of them before.
Am I the only one here that finds this animal a little creepy? Aww doesn't find me.
If a fox + wolf + deer + hyena, had a baby
Baby long legs firefox.
What a beautiful creature!! üòç
Do you think it's a good idea to feed it?
Looks like an Italian Greyhound combined with a fox
It's amazing how after years of living on this planet and watching countless nature documentaries and the like, and there are still apparently so many amazing, fascinating animals I've never seen before. What a cool animal.
I'm sorry the only thing i can see is a long fox about to sing the Wii theme
majestic
maned wolves walk kinda like the awkwardly tall kid in high school
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Seems like a cross between a hyena, fox, baby moose and a collie 

and, dogs is dogs when they eat moving on,y their lower jaw
I saw some in Salzburg zoo years ago, it was amazing to see them fairly close. It was a shame they were in an enclosure though, it looked like they really liked running with those long legs.
I thought it was gonna walk up there and take a turbo shit right in front of all those people.
Looks like a fox colored hyena.
It‚Äôs a folf! Or maybe a wox.
That‚Äôs just a fox on stilts
This looks like a deer and a wolf had a baby
Is dog or deer?
guys, here the popular name is "Lobo Guar√°". they are so elegant, aren't they?
Fucking majestic
How is she so elegant...why hasnt Vogue scooped her up yet?
Tallboi
What a magnificent animal, just stunning.
This is some Avatar-tier shit
To think there aren‚Äôt beings on this earth with higher intelligence than humans would be dumb of us. This beautiful long elegant fox looking creature is amazing.
I love the maned wolf, I see them every time I go to the San Diego Zoo, even seeing one get a wild duck one time.  Nasty sound as he ripped it to shreds.

They're actually wild dogs, rather than wolves or foxes which they look like.  Very cool animals.
That looks like a jackal.
My dark Eevee‚Äôs evolution
We call here "cachorro do mato" (jungle's dog)
L O N G F O X
This thing looks like a hyena, fox, horse hybrid
Holy shit. Where are the other 8 tails?
Bruh is that Jay Leno sitting on that bench over there?
I legit thought that was a horse lmaoooooo
the way it walks is so graceful
Why is he so chill around people and vice versa? Also, is that chicken and /pizza in that box? Why is that box there? Were the people expecting him? 
So. Many. Questions!
It‚Äôs beautiful, the proportions literally made me think it was a horse at first. Lol
I understand it's a pretty majestic creature but man does it just scream anxiety. 

Ears going every which way, eyes looking every which way plus the weird jerky movement.
Looks like a warefox
Thats a first for me. Its a beautiful animal.  üåü
Being its a wolf i wouldn't be feeding it. Especially not close to your home and family.  If its a pack animal itll be back with friends.
Whatever you call it. I'd stay the hell as way from that thing!
Is it a typo for ‚ÄòMang Wolf‚Äô like ‚ÄòHey Mang what‚Äôs up‚Äô 

Cuz I see no mane
Tall fox!

why the fuck is this in /awww? it looks like a hyena
Deer fox hyena
Is this a common thing to feed them?  Looks like a very fast animal. Such long legs.
are those the - the Chanel boots? yeah
Oh, man, even the WOLVES look like models in Brazil? What‚Äôs a floofy Canadian Grey Wolf got to compete with THAT?
Long legg
In the current meta, this is the lowest tier build in the canine class. Although the mane helps protect against critical hits, it‚Äôs the only build that has a solitary play style, which drastically lowers its pvp potential. For this reason, it‚Äôs also the only canine build that has to forage for XP in addition to hunting.
u/sgeraphylat did u know this existed??? Cuz I definitely did NOT
I literally work right next to these guys! (maned wolves)

I work at the San Diego Zoo, and my department's office is right next to the Maned Wolf habitat.

And of course, I have to regurgitate the fluff sign that the Zoo placed right next to their habitat: "Maned wolves are not wolves! Nor are they foxes." They're still canids tho
Is it scarier and stupider that they are teaching a wild huge wolf not to fear humans? Or that none of those dumbfucks has a mask on?
It's a "danger fox"!
This looks part deer.
Oh wow, never seen one before, so elegant and graceful. Gorgeous creature.
I think I‚Äôve seen this one before. Mufasa watch out!!

I love him.
He/She is magnificent!
Looks like and walks low like a fox, so crazy I've never seen this species of canine. Beautiful creature!

Lovely, but I hope you have an air freshener nearby.

We call them foxes where I am from
Damn, pretty *and* cute

Ashitaka and San must not be too far away...
I specifically checked the comments to see if anybody corrected Maned *Wolf* because that looks SO much like a Red Fox on steroids, except for the tail.

I love knowing now that the name is correct and that when I see one I can think of it as a Forest Spirit.

The word "lithe" springs to mind.

Wow, I didn‚Äôt even know an animal like this existed. And from the comments they‚Äôre not closely related to wolves/dogs/foxes? That‚Äôs crazy! What‚Äôs the story with these guys I‚Äôve never heard of them.

On a side note tho he definitely a hunger boi in this video
Lobo guar√° ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°

It looks like a supersized red fox
Ummm that‚Äôs a Hyena Fox bruh
Hi
My brain took a long hard second to realize that this wasn‚Äôt a horse...
He reminds me of the forest spirit from Avatar! Those long legs are so unusual, but he had a pretty coat
Are these the animals that put off a weed smell? Or am I completely imagining it? Help me!
Beautiful animal looks so delicate and almost nervous of whats around him
They remind me of hyenas those are some weird canines too but still really funny and the pups are cute and fluffy :)
That looks like a hyena mixed with a fox. Still a graceful looking creature
Aww? More like "aww fuck!". As much as it looks cute I wouldn't want to be close to that big boi
If I went to someone‚Äôs house and that thing slightly approached me I would immediately shit my pants.

It walks like a horse
It‚Äôs so tall
Protect it at all costs, it‚Äôs a unique animal and I wish for it to be keep alive
One thing i‚Äôve always thought was strange with these things is the way they walk. Most animals alternate their feet, but this thing moves both left feet then both right feet. It looks so weird.
I‚Äôm calling it a Giraffox!
I thought he was eating poutine
He looks like a deer, Fox, hyena combination doggo good boy

Okay, I had never heard of these things until a week ago. All of the sudden, I‚Äôm seeing them posted all over.

I like his little booties
I personally am freaked out about wolves that just walk up to people.
Everyone's just like "fuck yeah, let's drip molten plastic on it and eat its fingers"
Why did they evolve to be so tall?
