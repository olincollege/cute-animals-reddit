Love that dogs expression lol
Dogs are more exciting than humans anyway. Who needs to meet the neighbors?
That is a huge hole under that fence. I feel like you and your neighbor will become fast friends with the amount of times you'll return that adorable black dog to them.

Hey Sheila

Oh did Rex get out again?

Yep

Oh bring him by then, let yourself in I just put some tea on
That looks like a German Shepherd snoot doin a peek under that fence 🤔
Hi! I'm having a great time! Who are you? Hello! 
Lol, my neighbours doggo comes over quite regularly, or mine go over there, kind of an open door doggo policy. It's a lot of fun, sometimes I have up to seven doggos in my house, mayhem ensues but we all enjoy it!
lol Just like my neighbors dog! Except he's never gone under the fence. Olly used to jump it, but after a while a tree root running along our neighbors side of the fence broke one of the slats pushing it out so now he just comes as he pleases. We've all agreed to not fix the fence so he can visit and play with our pup at his leisure :)
HELLO HOOMAN DO YOU HAZ TREETS
You can just go ahead and cut a hole in that fence to make for easier access.
I love that nose poking under 
Best neighbors EVER!!!
oh, Hi! we are the doggos, n we just moved in next door

we thought we'd introduce ourselves (hey, what're neighbors for?)

we really like our yard, n we just thought we'd take a peek

to see if you had anything that maybe we could sneak....

i mean, you know, when someone moves into a neighborhood

the neighbors give them treats n stuff, like, Anything that's good

my hoomans gonna Love you, n i know they like to chat

just one more thing, my friend, we wondered: do you have a cat ?




Or their exited that someone finally came to rescue them.
I wish they were my neighbors. I would boop those snoots everyday.
Hi! Hi! Hi!  Your yard is my yard, too, right? We'll be right over! (Keep digging, Tony!)

Thanks for posting, this is too great.
Your new neighborhood seems ruff
Looks lovely. 
Aww
Lol Great face expression there.
Are there 2 or 3 dogs in this pic?
That's just so cute.
Butt if you've never met her before how do you know its "her dog" and not "his dog" hmmmmmmm
They are the neighbours. 
Does this remind you of the "Here's Johnny!" Scene from the shining? Except much cuter?
I know my dog neighbors names. Clueless to my human neighbors names. 
HENLO, FREN! I AM DOG
"Save us! We're trying to escape!"

"Our owner is a crazy person who's using us to build their super weapons!"

"Yeah, and they put anti-freeze in the wine!"
I love this!  I love dogs. 
The cuteness!!
wow, I wish my neighbor's dogs were nice like that, yesterday I was watering the garden and tried to talk to his barking dogs through the fence, when one of them jumped on the fence making it wobble, jeez...
Ya know hat dog that you can only see the nose of? 

I can tell it's a German shepherd lol
I think the dog on the right is almost your dog.
"Hi diddley ho there, neighbor!"
Doggos are best peoppos.
Haha how cute!
Holy shit, I was the 100,000 upvote
I hate it when a neighbours dog barks constantly to go in, or barks at any passing noise, this looks like hell
OH HAI HOOMAN DO YOU HAVE SNACKS AND SCRATCHIES?!
Well did you even invite them over yet? The dogs...forget the humans
I love this!  I love dogs. 
HENLO!!!
Build a doggy door in the fence!
You’ve already met the only important neighbor 
"Hi, hear ya got a cat".
How do you know this isn't one dog?
Cuties!! Damn makes me wish I had a dog
I haven’t met your new neighbor but I love her dogs
Awe, that's adorable! I wish I had neighbors with dogs like this.
"Hi! I'm a derp, and you're my new best friend! Oh, and "the nose" is pretty okay, too."
Naw just trying to escape from home
You need to get rid of that fence 
Need a roommate?  I can sleep in the yard no problem.  
Cutest expression from a dog ever 
The black dog looks exactly like mine
Hello’s you new hoooman!  I wuv’s you too!  Let’s play in your yard!  😍😀😎😝

Doggo:  "Oh, hai!  You haz snacks?"
Awww that’s soooo cute :3
Nice to see a friendly face.
Omg the snoot of the shepherd just poking through
DoGgO gEtS fUcKiNg CrUsHeD bY wAlL

Worth  giving them a bite of bacon.
HI WE ARE DOGS
This backyard looks like Texas.
Lol Great face expression there.
Are you in Ohio because these look EXACTLY like my sister’s dogs!!
beginning for a rom com ! im excited 
Welkum to da hood. Wee brot muffinz!!!
Hey what's the breed of the dog on the right? Mine looks exactly the same and i have no idea what it is.
Do you need a roommate? I need neighbors like that in my life. 
The dogs are very excited to see you. So goofy.
HENLO NEW TREAT GIVER
I love dogs!
Amazing. Great picture. That's one happy dog.
am i your new neighbor?! those dogs look exactly like mine.
Neighbor(s) * and You def have met them because I’m looking at  them. I’m sure their pet human is cute tho
“HELLO MA’AM ME AND THE BOYZ NEW IN TOWN I STOP BY TO SAY HELLO. CAN WE HAVE SOME SCRATCHES PLZ.”
This pic made my day. 
Bacon?! -dog probably
*HI!!!!*
Too cute!
Look at the horror in her eyes! You must be one ugly piece of work😂😂
Hey how’s it going there 
Ah, I see you've met General Snoot and Funny Bones! 
M. Aouu said.     ,x xx
“Play?!”
Holy shit Bill, there's a whole other world over here! 
Doesn’t it remind y’all of that scene in The Shining?
Look like cool dudes. Like "hey man, I got a six pack. Wanna chill?"
Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior lassie?
Lol
Maybe the dogs are the new neighbours,lol
Woah! What a wonderful dog, Pretty sure i saw the same one on my 7 year ***the america*** trip.

Congratulations on your success.
I love the variety in this welcome committee. 
Head, snoot, arm, all extending their sincerest greetings.
Feed it, then it will love you more than her/him, just adopt it
Her TWO dogs
🤗


Y

Y si
Dog on right: “GREETINGS HUMAN!”
Dog on left: “I’m too big...”
This is the cutest little derpiest dog I have eva seen!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣
Oooh!! If it's your fence, I would SO cut a little "doggie visitation door"! ❤️
So cute!! :)
Holy shit that looks like my dog and my next door neighbor's dog
Yea I think there is no way the neighbors can live up to the sheer awesomeness of their pets. The black dogs face had me giggling. 
If you zoom in on the dog's eye, it's like a James Bond opening sequence.
I WANT A FENCE DOGGO
I've never seen anything that excited 
Lucky. My new neighbors just moved in, they immediately put up a huge ugly white vinyl fence (that is actually illegally placed because of how close it is to the street) They couple are dog breeders, they have 4 large dogs of different breeds and the owners do not train them at all so they bark at every single noise. They have even begun to listen to me moving in my house, they will even bark if the floor creeks too loud! 
My husband recognizes our neighbors by their cars- I recognize them by their dogs
Haha,my neighbor’s dog was always out on her own,one night they were out of town and she was alone  so she spent the night with us boy was she happy! Will never forget her.
Ka-pow!
When are you getting your dog to complete the pack?
I love the one brown paw lmao.
Adorable!
Yall remember in Jurassic Park two. Where the raptors come from under the building. This is like that but way cuter. 
I would probably spend too much time sitting there petting them.
u/SeeLe_04
please post more photos of this wonderful doggo!
It'll be fucked up if that's all one dog.
happy doggo
damn you, Bacon Shoes!
Hahahaha cute
Best neighbors ever 
Excuse me sir, do you have a moment to talk about Dog, our Lord and Savior?
A nova classe precisa de uma mira  para um melhor combate a distância
thy boy is a happy about all
lololol thats so fucking cute
That's adorable.  When we first moved into our house here I was afraid to go anywhere near our property line even though the neighbor's dog was fenced.  Anytime I would get relatively close he would stop the incessant barking, get really quiet then begin to growl quietly but increasing in volume every step I took.  Yet he loves my partner, plops his ball over the fence trying to get him to throw it all the time.  Not sure what I could have done to make him hate me so much!
LOL! Every night we drive to this house and we feed their siberian husky LOL, and we've never even met the owner but that dog is like basically our second one.
Love it ! ( haven’t read the story yet)...
"Hey new best friend!"
Hi-do-ho neighbor!
Run them over
That is so cute.  :)  
Excuse Me, do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Saviour?
BABIES
G o o d b o y e
With such good bois it can only be a good neighbour
Are you my neighbor?
Would be a nice bridge to hook up!
r/AnimalsBeingDerps
It looks like she would be a goddam scream!
HELO FREN!
I HAVE TO MEET YOU
Lol
Ayye haha
"Save us! We're trying to escape!"

"Our owner is a crazy person who's using us to build their super weapons!"

"Yeah, and they put anti-freeze in the wine!"
'' Get a shovel and open that hole, so you will create de opportunity for some chit chat with your neighbour ''

That would sound a really psycho advice. 
So cute😭😭😭
You really need to print this out and tape it to their door, saying "The new neighbors seem nice" 
JEALOUS!!!!
Our dogs are twinsies https://www.reddit.com/r/mlem/comments/7faal6/he_may_be_a_derp_but_hes_my_derp/
"Please help me."
Those dogs look hyper
I hear it’s a sign of trust for a dog to stick one appendage under the fence, such as a claw or snoot. 

With that said, I’d watch that crazy boy on the end. He got his whole head under there to see what was going on with you. 
hELp uS!
Wonder if the dogs chose you as their surragote (or they are just super friendly, human loving dogs)
Lol i thought at first that was one long dog, until the 2nd snout came into view 🐕🐶
Poor dog snoot
Ha! Had the same thing earlier while trying to pull vines on the fence line. 
German shepherd not as excited as this guy. 
They are precious
If you zoom in on the dogs eye you can see the camera man
My dog manages to get her head stuck in our gate even though her head can't fit through it 
r/photoshopbattles
I count 3 good bois
Just noticed there there were too did the. Thought the snout of the other one was the leg and just had a different colored paw.
Heeeere's Johnny!
He's such a cute puppers
HEEEEEERE'S JOHNNY! 
That right one looks like a bro
Oh hi mark !
That's so funny. Lol how cute.
So cute😍

Hi there!
My neighbor introduced himself and his dog Stella.. I only remember his dog Stella
Poops, I dropped an entire salami beside MY fence on MY property.
I’ve seen this scene is the lost world
Give em a good skrichin
when you slide into those DM's
That’s all you need 
There's a super friendly bear in my apartment building named Bamse. He's too big for his own good. He WILL lick you til there's nothing left to lick. 
Looks like a velvety German Shepherd snoot on the left there!
The shining and Airbud mashup
That dog looks exactly like my Mothers. Do you know what he is? I know he’s mixed but if you know would you mind telling me? Thanks!
The Walking Dogs.
“The Lost World: Jurassic Park”
The resemblance the black dog has to my dog is shocking.
Now say goodnight.
Lol thats funny
"Ayyyyyy, new neighbour! Wassup?"
Tbh I'd become her friend just to watch her dogs 😭 super cute pic
Without context, that dog looks likes he crying for help lmao
“WHY HECKIN HELLO DUR”
My god that is so annoying! I would put a fence or something in there.

God I'm glad you love it, I wouldn't.
Pardon me! I know we just met but would you happen to have any bacon on you? 
I thought that was three dogs hahaha 
Nice

Oh hai Homan. Plz send yummies! 
the best thing about pups is how they know they're goofy and like when you laugh at them

i like cats but they do NOT comprehend humor, only humiliation :P
great, the dogs seem very friendly, I do not know how but they realize if it is a bad or good person, if they are good is great, when I moved I had the opposite case and it was very sad, but in the end everything went well
Omg ! I would ask if i could bring them over just so i can have a play date with them ! 
Oh my dog, they look just like my fur baby! 😍
This is awesome
That one like like my pup, including socks!
I'm a bit worried that this might end like Wilfred.
"hi there. i do not know you but i love you" 
HELLO NEW HOOMAN! YOU HAVE A VERY NICE GROUND! WE ARE FRIENDS NOW!
Did you assume hyr gender?
This made me LOL SO friggin cute 
“Heeeres Johnny!”
I wish my neighbors' dogs were so friendly.
This looks uncannily similar to my 3 dogs
It smells like updog in here.
I swear that's my dog lol 
I know why? I've had similar experience too. 
My dog sticks his 'beak' under my fence whenever I leave. It's kinda like one of the dogs in the picture.
are you assuming her gender??
It looks like the attack on Titan scene where Rhiner opens the door and the titans outside
Well hello neighbor.
Hahahah,seems two puppy there. so cute.
I see 2 black snot boxes....where does the yellow arm come from!?!? Shit....I won't be able to sleep....
That is way to cute!!! So cute!
Funny dog :)
You know what they say: If their doggos love you, they love you.
That's determination
HALLO NEIGHBOR LADY. YOU WANNA MEET MY MOM 
heh heh hooman. ober here. down here. henlo new fren. nice to meet you. 🐶
I saw adorable dogs, take my upvote.
Thats a lot of karma
I love that right dog is tiny enough for the full face attention grab and the "pet me" smile. Left dog is just trying to be a part of the whole thing with a nose and a paw, Haha too funny for me. 
[sorry but i had to do it](https://reddit.app.link/rm0wvLuuAO) 
kind a funny story that happened to me half drunk fri night 

i'm at my friends house and the weather was looking iffy I went out to the front driveway to see if the dark clouds were coming this way, some rano russian guy speaking russian to his dog was walking past when suddenly to the left of my peripheral vision a lady was walking her 2 dogs and came upon russian guy and she spoke russian to him and they russian back to eachother some shit but her golden come running at me at full neck break speed like he had not seen me in some 30 years (tf I don't know these people or dog)... this dog might have broken some rape law... I tried my best to indulge and scratch behind his ear and the dog started moaning and doing the phantom leg scratch thing then it got down and started spazzing, gyrating back and forth so I rubbed the belly I know dogs like that but it went nuts and was making all sorts of noises all the while the little pug on the leash was barking at me

I didn't know what to make of this and just sort of looked at russian lady like oh (way too) friendly dog and wtf why is he not on leash 
Aawww lucky you! This post made my day....I hope you have a few more cute doggo posts to follow! 
A, as,
Maybe the dogs are the true neighbours. I mean if a thief comes through the area, the dogs will bark, and the sleeping neighbours will just try to tell them to shut up...
I love this doggo!!!
HELLO FREN I DON'T KNOW YOU BUT YOU'RE MY BEST FREN ALSO THESE ARE MY OTHER BEST FRENS. 
Black doggie looks like he's gonna eat ya.  
"Oh hi, do you have about 30mins to talk about our lord and savior Jesus Christ?"
Awh how cute lol 
Oh hai!!
I’ve been coming back to this post all day. THANK YOU. This pic is making my day. 
Hidy ho good neighbor!!
That expression lol. What a good doggo. 
I think that black dog loves everyone
Aww! So cute!
Every neighbor is terrible. Don't fall for it!
OH HAI
That's major derping.

I see two snoots begging to be booped 
Omg such puppers
So damn cute
Beware of dogs!!
HELLO NEIGHBOR, CAN I INTEREST YOU IN SOME BORK?!
Be careful when your dogs stick their heads out under the fence! My dog did this one night and I kept hearing weird noises. When I went out I caught my dog under the fence with her head stuck and was choking. We were so lucky we found her just in time. We made sure to fill that gap after that. Whew! All the love for you and your pups!
"Hey there new bestie!!!" 
hahaha
Sooooo cute!!!!!!!¡
Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour? 
Lol
Adorable!
Hi I'm butch, and I have one brown leg, and one black leg, and the black one is asking for scratches. ..
It took me a while to realize that there are three dogs. One extra black dog is sticking out his snout in the middle
Black dog gives a look like dude get caught escaping ***FRIENDZONE***
HELLO FREN
Its time to become really good friend with this neighbor and offer to puppy sit whenever they need it.
This is like prison break but dog version.
I never spoke with any of my neighbors until I got a dog. Now, the only neighbours I know have dogs :) 
This dog looks almost identical to my dog!
If the black one had just a touch less white in the paw, if think you were out new neighbors behind us.
Good dogs means a pretty nice person. Not all the time, but it's not a bad litmas test. 
This. This is the kind of content I needed to brighten my day. 

Thank you for sharing!
"**HEY FREN, YOU GOTS MEATS?? OUR HOOMAN IS VEGANZ.**"
I think her DOGS love you!

Edit: I’m just gunna leave this here so y’all know how dumb I am.
You should quietly dig away a little of the dirt so they can come all the way over
At least it's not his wife.
Then you must be good people. 
Awe, you should stick your head underneath your neighbor's fence and introduce yourself!!!
He wants to play so much. God I love dogs.  
When friends hear that you have weed
I don't know wahat this is or where the hell I've navigated on my phone , but I love it!!!! You guys are my people 😘
You'll float too!  =D
Dogs love everyone 
This reminds me of the overly attached girlfriend...she was creepy...she's still hot thou.
Wow, the one on the right is a carbon copy of my son's derpy dog (right down to the socks and the nose and the expression - does it also have a white chest?).
Now you'll have a conversation starter :)

Hi! Pets us please
I know you only have the best intentions here, but I would talk to your neighbor before you encourage her dogs to peak under the fence like that. My neighbors love my dog, and she's dug a huge hole trying to get under the fence to see them. 
Ugh, I'd cover that hole so fast if my neighbor's dogs could get through. 
Yup that’s love 
Love this, what a bunch of cute poochie doggies😉😛 oh what fun your all gonna have.
You should introduce yourself so maybe you get a chance to play with those pups.
Hey hooman

Karen's out

It's digging time
Add doggie door. Problems solved.
This is how many marriages start
Clearly they loved the old owner and his treats, don't let them get disappointed and personal.
German Shepherd Droop Snoot
My dog looks exactly like the black dog with white paws. Exactly. What breed/where do you get him/her?
Y’all got any o that…pupperoni?
HEEERRRREEEE's Doggo!
Cute 
I like animals more than people also.
Your neighbors and their doggos are lucky to have you as their neighbors! I was playing fetch with my pup in my yard (no fence. It's a rental house so I'm not investing in one) and my pup saw a dude walking by and just ran a lap around him. He didn't jump or bark, he just loves everyone. The guy threatened to break his jaw and kill him! Now I carry a metal baseball bat every time I take my pup out. Wish we had neighbors like you!
Awesome. lol
❤❤❤
That’s awesome, they’re prob more friendly then your neighbors anyway
a wired hellow!?!?!!!
"Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior, cheese and treats?"
Build that wall. Haha. I love doggos.
This is hilarious
"Oh hi!"

This is one of those reminders of how awesome dogs are, love it!
"Hello we are dog, dog and Bob!"
that big ol' smile makes me happy.
"Well hewwo there Fren!" 
cool.
Hiii cutie 
This is a border collie love those dogs!
"Well Howdy!"
The dog “Here’s Johnny!”
Could we please have our ball back, nice lady?
Assuming I had an otherwise well fenced in yard, I'd probably just encourage them to keep digging and maybe help out a bit...
So cute
What’s up frens, good boi here. Comin to you live from unda the fence. Don’t forget to leave a treat, subscribe, and hit the bell icon. It really helps out my channel. Please stop by everyday.
No, they are your neighbors
Dog in the most polite way possible: “We’re kinda in the middle of something. Can you come back a little later?”
This is the purest thing I’ve seen on the internet today. 
/r/peoplefuckingdying
Puppies just want to come play with you! You should ask your neighbor if the dogs made that hole under the fence or if it was already like that..
Dogs are the best off a limb here 
HAI
If you haven't met them, how do you know they're a female? #triggered
