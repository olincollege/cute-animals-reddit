You’re not beautiful doggo. You’re perfect.
what a princess!
I foster dogs. She'd definitely be a foster fail.
She is so beautiful!
 Wow! such a pretty puppy!
My pit died a few weeks ago. This makes me so happy.
Why are there always so many removed comments on pitbull threads?
She’s not beautiful. 



She’s drop dead gorgeous.
Beautiful beautiful pooch
[removed]
Not to be dramatic but I would die for her
Pitts have my favorite dog eyes
This dog brings joy to my heart
you underestimate my ability to lie.. oh no I can’t do it this time: what a cutie!!
Yo why are soooooo many comments saying how cute they think the dog is being downvoted? Holy crap bro.
Wow what happened here it's like someone tipped reddit's award bucket over this post.
She is so gorgeous  and wish I could have one.
Why can’t I upvote this a billion times? Too cute
That is a ridiculously photogenic animal
Do hearding dogs instinctively heard? Or do they need training. Of course to be real good they needs to be trained.. but seems like my lab does retriever type things w no training
😻!

💭 I used to walk to the animal shelter, when I was at the homeless shelter... saw one pitbull that was covered in razor blade cuts... anyways, *of course any animal can be raised violently,* but from my experience, every pb I met there was a sweetheart.
i would die for her
She's the loveliest. And the smile is precious.
She should be on dog food bags
Literally made me awwwww out loud. She’s precious!
I could but I'd be instantly struck by lightning
what a little ham 🥺
She's the velvet hippo they all wish they could be! 🤣 Gorgeous baby!
Allow me to demonstrate, she’s not beautiful. (She’s beautiful)
Pretty girrrrl
She is adorable
Super beautiful!
She is beautiful and charming

Boy sorting by controversial is a mistake in this thread.
I can, but I would be lying
I had a dobber man when I was younger, she was taller than me. Every time I sat on the bed or sofa shed come and sit with her butt in my lap. She was with me all the time. I miss her :c.
She’s not, she’s gorgeous.

I absolutely can, but I’d be a gd liar.
She’s not...


...She’s fucking fabulous

That smile. That damn smile
She’s beautiful
You aren't beautiful you're gorgeous
Such a pretty puppy!
Bro, whats with all these heart-felt comments that are literally wholesome as fuck, getting downvoted for? Like, are people that against pitties? I own a pitbull-greyhound mix and is literally one of the biggest babies in the world. I just dont understand people. They used to be nanny dogs in the 1800's, and yet, people literally try to put down this species saying "one down, 100k left to go" "oh, ive been trying to get my neighbor to sell her pitbull so i can take it to get put down" like, y'all have no compassion to others except yourself. Y'all are the same sort of people that say that masks are bad for your health, that vaccines cause autism, and that the world is flat. Do your research on trustworthy websites and maybe talk to vets and pit owners.
[removed]
Why would I even try
I would die for that dog

[removed]
Honestly pitbulls are some of the biggest babies of the dog world
I sure as hell can
They don't deserve anything else but love and care.
Aren’t those dogs aggressive?
Pitt are cute dogs, sadly they have a bad rep.
Why would she, she is. What a gorgeous sweet girl. I love her bow.

That’s such a lady
I love her so much!! She makes me miss my girl, Coco.  She was a red nose pit from the pound. We spent 12 amazing years together. Keep treating that cutie right!
She clearly already knows she's beautiful but that's not gonna stop me from telling her anyway!
Ummm..yeah because she is beautiful.  Such a sweet face.  You my human friend are lucky.
I wanna smoosh her face with my face sooo bad haha what a cute pup!
Adorable.
*Could you be... the most beautiful girl in the world?*
Alow me to demonstrate, you're not beautiful...you are perfect
Why would I lie to such a sweetheart?
She is perfect.

I love her
This picture made my day. Such a cute princess!
My heart. ❤️❤️❤️
Please tell me you have this framed somewhere in your house
[removed]
I’m going to be honest here,I don’t think she’s that attractive. If you think she’s cute, that’s all good, but personally I find her a bit creepy and weird. No hate though! And I appreciate the positivity but I just want to be honest and share my opinion :)
She is so pretty!  What a lovely lady.  Xoxo
What a baby aww
She’s a beautiful girl!
Gorgeous 😍💕
She’s not beautiful.





She’s gorgeous.
She looks like a snuggler :)
Of course I can but that’ll make me a liar

What a pretty girl!!!
Oh no, she’s not beautiful, SHE’S GORGEOUS🥺

Oh my cuteness!❤️
I have a six year-old Pit rescue (former bait dog) she’s been an absolutely amazing! Cute dog.
Awww, adorable!
She's totally gorgeous!
She is the most beautiful and Goodest girl !!!
This is the cutest dog i have ever seen
She’s gorgeous!
I used to hold my dog in my hands and take my thumbs and rub the valley between her eyes. Her favorite thing. She would always fall asleep. Hug your baby for me.
She’s gorgeous!
She is very beautiful and those eyes!!!
She is beautiful
She’s perfect and I love her.
Super adorable
Omg angel 😍😍
I needed this at the top of my feed today. Thank you pretty girl!
I could but I would just be lying.
Pretty girl
So fucking adorable.
I recognized this pooch instantly!! Frieda! I follow her on insta and it’s my fav thing to scroll upon!
It's actually illegal to tell her she's not beautiful, it's true! I checked!
The prettiest good girl I’ve ever seen. SO cute
She’s so beautiful!!!😍
Some of you in the comments are more aggressive in your hate for dogs than the dogs you hate, damn
Pretty pittie princess
My god! She is the epitome of beautiful!!
Awww velvet hippos are the best!!!
She looks like the kind of dog that would bite your hand and never let go ❤️
She is absolutely beautiful!
Didn’t even read the caption til after but immediate thoughts were “well hi there pretty girl~” so you right.
She isn't beautiful, she is gorgeous!
Looks like a beautiful cuddly princess to me!
Pibbles are such good dogs and I love them
She is a sweetheart! Pitt bulls get a bad rap but the fault lies with the humans who get them, dont train them and incorrectly breed them for aggression. The dogs are pure and honest. Big hugs to your gorgeous girl!
We don’t deserve dogs.

How do people demonize this beautiful, peaceful breed?

Blame the owner.  Never the dog.
Please tell me this dog has an Instagram
Calling her beautiful would be a severe understatement
Imagine wanting to ban this adorable creature.
I must know this baby girl’s name!!! She’s beautiful!
shes not beautiful 



shes absolutely gorgeous
She's absolutely adorable. What a beautiful sweet girl. Give extra loves and kisses to her for me. Thanks for sharing your pup.  ❤❤❤
She’s adorable!

She's so pretty😍😍😍😍😍
She is a beauty
She’s so beautiful omg I love her so much <3
Oh my goodness. She’s so beautiful!!
I like the way pitbulls look. They're chunky and squat like a big potato. I know there's controversy surrounding the breed, but purely on an aesthetic basis I think their big fat heads are cute.
Velvet hippo 💕
Holy fuck, people are scared shitless of pit bulls on here, huh? 😂 lmao so many people just downvoting everything. Fucking Reddit
[removed]
He knew exactly where he belonged. I’m sure he was a majestic pup.
OMG be still my heart. She is adorable.
Hello, I would like to order six of her, please and thank you.
So beautiful just want to give her all the hugs and kisses
Oh my gosh. She is the cutest thing!
You can tell her she's not beautiful, but you'd be lying.
I want to hug her so bad!
Plot twist: he's a male dog with a ribbon.
Damn! I thought I can.
So cute
I could I would just die inside a bit
Soooooooo cuteeeeeee
she isnt beautiful

True facts
She’s gorgeous 😭
A true beautiful princess 😭💗
Pretty girl!
Can you give her a kiss for me? She is a model 😍
Talk about flawless! 😍
That's a lady! She's so beautiful
Omg 🥰🥰
She is so prim and proper look at her I love her so much
What a adorable puddin cup!😍
That smirk lol
I’m pretty sure she already knows 😌
She's not beautiful.   That's far too mild of a word to describe that gorgeous face.
so much hate on this post - really surprised a lot of people hate on pitties on reddit. i know they get a bad rep but it all depends entirely on the owner and the upbringing of the dog. any dog can bite you and attack you. i worked at a vet clinic and we had way more other breeds like german shepherds (not to pick on them specifically) try to bite us than pitbulls
Idk why people hate pit bulls

Yeah some can be nasty but speaking from personal experience

Most are nice
Nor would I
I’m sure it’s been said but I could tel her that... but I’d be lying
OMG below me .....Fucking asshole...any way...beautiful....
No, I mean, I can, but that'd make me a jerk and a liar.
10/10 would snug this cute lady.
Good looking girl ya got there OP.
Oh wow I love her 😍

This is the cutest picture ever of a pit bull. I absolutely love it!
Soooo fucking god damn cute, I’d hug that pretty pit and politely ask her for a kiss on the cheek.
Who would DARE tell this baby she isn't beautiful!

You're not beautiful. You're absolutely gorgeous
Oh she is GORGEOUS! Such a pretty lady.
Love her! She is beautiful! Dogs are kinda the best...

Sure I can.

I read this as “you can’t tell if she’s beautiful or not” and was infuriated.
at times dogs are very helpful too
No, I could tell her that.

But I'd be lying.
Nicest dog I have ever met was a pit... She was the best I miss her...
I love that bow! ❤❤❤❤
There’s definitely a lot more dogs more “beautiful” than this thing.
*tells her shes not beautifull*
I love this dog princess
She's not.
Thats an ugly ass dog looks like an unborn fetus.
Don’t worry, I’ll be with a vacuum to suck up the puddle that is now my heart! She’s gorgeous!
She is beautiful ❤️
Felt cute, might eat ur baby later
Those paws.  Hnnng.

Why am I being downvoted for crediting someone?
I have a Pit / Basset mix who if you walked in on her lying down you would think was a potbelly pig with her Pitbull face, barrel body, and stubby little legs. Tons of personality.
Omg, what a sweet, sweet face! <3
She's so sweet 🤗❤🌻

I just want to kiss her forehead!
My pit is a lap dog af it’s CRAZY! Male , purebred and he’s just honestly the most docile dog I’ve ever met. It was really amazing seeing as this is my first dog. :) she’s gorgeous congrats
These anti pit Karens are the same assholes who don't wear masks.

If I had that dog I would be so worried about some stealing her all the time

Nope, kinda an ugly breed
Not a fan at all definitely the second worse breed out there with bulldogs
Yes we can lol
Im paralyzed
I thought it said if you can’t tell she not beautiful lol
i can
why not? /s
You can tell her...so what?
Aww
It's physically impossible to say, lip or type the words "She is beautiful"

Wait, that's not right lol lemme try this again

She is beautiful, and a very good girl.

i give up, point proven
But she’s a dangerous pit bull!
She’s not
would it have killed you to paint her toenails a matching pink?

&#x200B;

regardless , who could tell her other wise, she is beautiful . I just lost my tuxedo pitty 3 months ago and my heart is still broken
Idk why but as a 27 year old 200 lb man I really feel this pic. Really resonates
Yes I can.
OVER-ACTOR!  

edit: Is this controversial because folks aren't getting the reference or because of all the 'agendas' going on? You know what, I don't care. Unsubbed.
What a princess

Ugly dog with an ass crack head

I’d paint her toe nails to match that bow. 😍😍😍

Shes sooooooooooooo freeking cute!!!! And if you tell her shes not you are MEAN and a JERK.

No she is not, she’s dangerous
Yes I can. And she wouldnt understand me because she doesnt speak English.. because it's a dog.
10/10 wood bang
i would NEVER tell her that. she is doing the best job and i love her
I don’t think she speaks human languages so even if I tell her she’s ugly she wouldn’t get it
