I can hardly wait until she watches Monsters Inc.This picture should be turned into a painting."I am leaving!" *stomps loudly in place*All the toys in the world must be so annoyed by kids pulling this shit. Cuts into their down time massively!Do they make remote controlled toy story toys? If not, they should!  Even if you could just make Woody or Buzz's head turnIs it weird Toy Story scared me a bit when I was little? The thought of toys moving when you're not in the room just creeped me out.This is so cute! I miss the magic of childhood, but being around kids brings it right back!Plant some walkie talkies behind some toys and by the door then say into one "is she gone" then one by door "no,  shhh". Lol jk don't do it.Haha! That's so adorable.You should move her toys around when she's not looking. Just one or two at a time.Love her dress/nightgown. Tell her to keep trying!I remember that when the first movie was released in Germany, I was absolutely captivated by the idea of my toys being able to move and live their own little lives. One day we went to McDonald's, which was a big deal for me, because my parents didn't want me to eat fast food. Anyway, they had a Happy Meal with all the important characters from the film and of course I had to have Buzz Lightyear.

For a while he became my favourite ever toy in the world, because I was absolutely certain that he was different from my other toys. Unlike the others, he was definitely a sentient being with his own hopes and aspirations. In my mind, he regularly went on adventures in my room, which seemed all the more likely because my mother secretly moved him around my room while I slept. I would go as far as marking where I put him down last with a pencil to "make it harder" for him to keep his nightly activities go unnoticed. 

Sure enough, my mother noticed my meticulousness and adapted the way she would move him during the night. For example, she would simply turn him around by 180 degrees to make it seem like he was getting sloppy etc.

I'm glad to see that the magic of Toy Story is still going strong even amongst the youngest generation. Happy for you, and glad that I could share my own story.When I was little we had movies about toys coming to life too...they were about a doll named Chucky. I, too, used to peek around my door to see if my toys came to life but more in terror than wonder. LolThis is the cutest shit I ever seenI used to do this when I was younger after watching Toy Story lol. I would say goodbye to my toys and make a bunch of noise running down the stairs and then creep as quietly as possible back up the stairs so my toys couldn't hear me.. I never did catch them in the act...When I was a kid I watched Toy Story, then broke my Buzz Lightyear and waited him to get fixed by his friends...


...I was disapointed.Beautiful and fantasticNGL am well into adulthood and such thoughts cross my mind still.Reminds me of my niece asking if the Weeping Angels were real when she was around this age.

As an uncle, it was always my duty to instill as much healthy skepticism and critical thinking in her as possible...so I told her that many people believe in a theory that says there are infinite universes wherein anything and everything is real in one of them.  That stuck with her for a while, but no nightmares or anything (she was a tough cookie).

Never could get her to believe trees were just big broccoli.  I consider that my greatest failure to date.Show her this. https://youtu.be/udaDTiPTbBkIn fairness you can see the dinosaur on the draws watching the door to see if shes coming backImagine if she saw Inside Out and whenever she‚Äôs crying she shouts to herself ‚ÄúStop!‚ÄùTell her that the toys aren‚Äôt stupid.Dude, the toys won't come to life if they can see you. You need to leave.Your toy storage system has given me new hope for my kids‚Äô room.ANDYS COMINGIt won't work if you're standing there taking a picture[/r/accidentalrockwell](https://www.reddit.com/r/accidentalrockwell/)My heart can't take it.196k upvotes!?

She's a darling girl. I love that she thinks she's tricking the toys into thinking she's gone and coming out.

Little adorable sneak. She looks like she's sure she's going to see them.

So cute./r/KidsAreIdiots‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢I‚Äôve never seen Toy Story so I‚Äôm absolutely clueless.After doing it dozens of times she will come to the logical conclusion that her toys are really good at playing dead.One day, she‚Äôll catch them!I needed this after the kind of day I've had. She's adorable!Little does she know, the toys moving without the whimsical music would be the stuff of nightmares.

‚ÄúWhy mommy?‚Äù  
‚ÄúUmm hunny you will understand when you‚Äôre older.‚ÄùThis captures the absolute magic and innocence of childhood imagination. It‚Äôs seriously an amazing photo. And it‚Äôs adorable as hell.I feel like you should put a camera in her room to help her catch her toys playing. Then you could make a stop motion video as evidence that they are alive.Yeah rightr/untrustworthypoptartsPoor kid.In all seriousness, this is the kind of thing Fred Rogers (Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood) hated. We're supposed to let kids know what's real and what's not. This is funny to us, but in the mind of a child they are wrestling with if they are abusing their toys or not.

The imagination is a wonderful thing, but so is knowing the difference between what's real and what's not.That is SO cute!That triceratops reminds me of exactly that hah, adorableThat is insanely adorable.That's freaking adorableSo stinking adorable!!!ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞I remember doing this as a kid after toy story 2 came out ü•∫This is so sweetThe idea of that faceless figure coming to life is haunting enough.I used to believe my toys would come alive so whole-heartedly that one morning my dad told me to crawl in bed with mum so he could ‚Äútest‚Äù that theory by filming my room when no one was in it. 

He set up our video camera, put my barbie in her little convertible and took a series of stop motion photos of her ‚Äúdriving‚Äù the car and waving at the camera. When he called me back in to show me the footage I was jumping for joy. That‚Äôs one of the best memories I have to date :)This is insanely cute.Awwwww!!!I just got my 4 and 2 year old addicted to Toy Story...+1Oh my...
This is so adorable :DOMG! Hand me that tissue.That is so cuteThat is a beautiful roomThis tiny human must be protected at all cost.Pretty cute.This is so adorable. What a perfect picture.But the toys will never move if you stare at them with your camera...I totally did this when I was little! 

I was fully convinced after Toy Story that my plastic T-Rex was coming to life when I wasn‚Äôt in the room. I thought for sure that I was missing out on his adventures and spent way too much time watching him and my other toys thru the key hole.I used to tell my stuffed animals that I wouldn't tell anyone that they were alive and that they could totally trust 8-year-old me. Never fooled them.I love this, true definition of awwThat's really wholesomeSo adorable!God this is so pureBeyond adorableEverything set up perfect for the pictureThat is so freaking adorable!!!She's precious!
