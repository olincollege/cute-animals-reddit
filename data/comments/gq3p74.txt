Next we need a little mouse to climb on the cat and have a nap
Worked for me!
Cat and seal are one.
i would die for this cat
That cat flattened the curve adorably.
I was actually having a pretty good day, but this made it awesome.
Adorable
What a cute kitty

I get a good feel

She looks so pretty 

Sitting on that seal
Their eyes are squinted in the same way on the bottom 2 pictures! So cute.
Thats a seal plushie from a certain marine zoo thing in japan i think.
2 of my favorite animals! This made my day better:)
My name is Cat,

this water cat

I lay rite down.

We both are flat.
Me: This is important day. There are lot of things I should do.
5 mins later:
Be like water, you can assume any shape and adapt yourself accordingly
What so special about two pancakes stacked up... Kidding, they are pretty cute. \*smears them with syrup\*

Awwww
That's the cutest shit I've seen
Omg i want oneüòç
So cute! I hope you have a much better day tomorrow ‚ù§üåª
I had a pretty shitty night last night. Seeing cute/calm stuff like this is a great way to cheer up. Hope you feel better OP!

SealCat is cute
Life imitates art
I love Maru!!
why all cat so cute
Yes
Really needed this, thanks...
Too cute
It did. It did make my bay better
It's like a person who's sleeping, but sleeping so well that you're concerned they may actually be dead!  Here, I'd poke the cat every now and then to make sure she doesn't evaporate!
They have the same face!
Thanks, this made my night much better! :)
Aww
We all need to be a cat lying on top of a seal sometimes. :)
Hell yea
two cute chonkeeeers!
So lovely. How can make your face look like the same :))
Yep. That did it. Day is better.
Yes it did! Thanks for posting!
I needed this
I wish I had friends that did this

This poor cat is gonna get arthritis and die of heart disease cause the piece of shit owners don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs fat. ‚ÄúOh haha my cats a chonk isn‚Äôt he cute?‚Äù Fuck off and maybe treat your animal with some decency and don‚Äôt let it eat so much it gets this fat
This is my [go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSM3x9G7eTQ). Has never failed to make people laugh.
This was stolen. Your title is a lie
What a chunk. I love him.
No it didn't, it just made me feel sorry for the obese cat. Poor thing.
Chonk^2
Who TF asked? That's right ME I TF asked !! Give me more!

Obese animals who suffer health issues. So funny right?
this is cute and all but fat cats are not healthy
Where does one get the fat seal?
This must be what my dog and cat feel when they lay on top of me.  As you can see the pillow already resembles me.
!remindme 16h
Like Mei laying on Totoro's belly and taking a nap
My goodness!
It does. I didn't have a bad day, but this still made it better. I'm saving it for when I do have a bad day. Thank you.
Lol it definitely did

I didn't know I needed this but it really helped, thanks

Which one is the plush ?
[deleted]
Is so fluffy omg
I'm hoping the cat would adapt himself to mirror any animal-themed cushion he sits on. Could be a running series.
Chonks on chonks
So cute

Their eyes match completely, so cute

It makes it better, then worse, then a bit better.
Adorable

Omg so adorable
Need nothing but the kitty kitty on the happy floof bed.
Double loaf supreme
Yeah thanks man felt really bad today it kinda helps.
People who have bad days, I need you to tell me too so that I can do something good about it to lift you up.
Omg that's so cute  i love it
Kitty! Yay
Cute but that seal looks like it got mouldy and then stained after trying to clean it.
Yes, it has put a smile on my face and now my day is definitely better üòä
This is way better than r/realgirls
Lol
It kept sinking ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yes, it does. Thank you
So lucky of you to have a friend you can share with

*Looks at profile* That‚Äôs my seratonin
Awww
So lovely!
which one is more sqoosh
first world problems can be fixed just like that
I can hear the 'awww yisss' in the last frame
I imagine whoever made that pillow is selling more of them now.
Aww it's so cute! Thank you
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking why the bad day?
r/chonkyanimals
happy brother's day
I‚Äôm feeling what they feel yo....
r/chonkers is leaking
No. It doesn‚Äôt. But thanks for trying
So cute
Too cute!!
Hope it doesn‚Äôt it.
I thank you for my day was bad now it is good
Nekoconeko!
Perfect. It was legendary.
Indeed
Isnt this one of those seal plushes they sell at osaka aqurium?
I have the gray version of the seal. It's as squishy as it looks. Definitely know how the cat feels. :)
This is the cutest thing I've seen all day
Yes.   helped me feel better.  Thanks
I just ordered 2 of those chonkers on Amazon prime. The large ones (23‚Äù long) were $39.99 each. They‚Äôll be here on Friday! ü•∞
Please thank your friend
TWINS!
4 stages of happiness.
so cute!
If a friend send me that he really knows me, such a true friend
His ears are great
Yes, it does. Bad day with the eating disorder already. I'm already feeling better. Thank you.
this is so wholesome

r/MadeMeSmile
I have the same seal plush, gonna try it out with my cat now!
You must have some good friends because if I said I'm having a bad day I'd get porn links
I constantly get adds for that seal plush and I now want it even more in hopes my cats too will lay on it.
Can anyone tell me where you find these seals? I‚Äôve found many online but all the reviews said they didn‚Äôt receive what was in the picture they got some low quality shit instead. Where can I find one that really looks like this??
This did actually make my day better after my gf broke up with me
This carries a level of blessed energy, previously unheard of.
Where can I acquire le squishy seal?
Loaf
Yeah that worked. üòä
I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE
Purfect for the seal of approval
Would make any cat lovers day better! Love it
Guys I ordered this and the cat was not included. This is a warning for anyone interested.
It does, tanks
Nope, my crush is still (probably) fucking a random greek god right now üòí
This is now my new phone wallpaper!

THANKYOU

This made me giggle quite a bit üòÇ

I'd come by and yeet the cat into a nearby lake and say "FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO THEN BRIGHTEN MY DAY!"
It very much does help my shitty day, thank you üòò
This cat is depressingly overweight
Donno if I‚Äôm the only one, I enjoy these sorts of animal things, but they never make my day better.
It didn't but I appreciate the attempt
If you‚Äôre actually having a bad day, a picture of a cat won‚Äôt make it better.
My cat just died so this makes me feel worse tbh
-_-
Not trying to be rude, but that cat looks a little overweight. How are they?
Personally looking at a morbidly obese cat isn't making me go aww.

That did help, thank you
Look at that absolute unit!!! Babey!!!
I too used to send pics of cats to my girlfriend. She's my wife now.
Made me smile
‚ÄúoMg whAT a cUtE cHOnk‚Äù this cat is obese and likely has major health problems or is bound to get them soon.
[deleted]
ew they both look ugly
c h O N k
No, not even a little bit. In fact it made it worse because the title had me expecting something that didnt come through.
It didn't work but thanks anyway
Le chonker days before it dies from heart disease.
Nope, didn't make my day at all
For some reason my brother started swearing at me to f off when I showed this to him. Im the older brother and he's 10...
The seal is Arare-chan from the Osaka aqauarium!
