The little jump is amazing. 
If I tell my cat to get down or stop, she just stares at me like I won‚Äôt do anything and as soon as I move towards her or start to stand up she sprints away at full speed. 
Oh fuck! CHEESE IT!!!
The jump and delayed reaction.  Ha
The little jump before he runs away kills me
"I'm not a good boy."
That's mine with any white apple cable. No! It's not a toy. Who am I kidding?
Busted
That moment when you realize mom is watching
Caught with the yarn, red-handed.
They know.

 mine will look me dead in the eye and scratch the couch like "oh what, are you going to hurt a poor defenseless animal?" 

No but I will get you wet

*Almighty squirt gun*


"Oh shit oh shit I'm sorry I'm sorry!!"

His thought process goes something like "man, yarn is so much fun, I could do this all day... Oh, hey the... OH SHIT, OH GOD, RUN! ^IT ^WASN'T ^ME " 
Heheh the ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù jump 
Totally off topic but is that a DDR mat and if so, how do you like it?
Caught red stranded 
Cats are the best. 
I love that little jump of surprise.......‚Äùoh, you‚Äôre still here???‚Äù
‚ÄúHuh, this is fun.. *turns to the right* Oh fuck! Oh, human you scar‚Äî Oh FUCK KAREN!‚Äù
Don't let cats play with strings or spools of yarn like that. Many cats, if they end up swallowing a bit, will keep swallowing and swallowing. They won't chew it off or be able to regurgitate it. Learned that the hard way with a barley alive cat $3k worth of surgeries later. Fucker got into the sewing room and ate meters worth of thread.
Cute. Mine would have doubled down and desperately pawed as much yarn into his mouth and chewed furiously until I dared sacrifice a finger to retrieve it from his throat.
I don't think I've ever seen a cat do a double take before
Oh shit. She caught me again! 
That "OH SHIET" face
*oh shit* 
They are like fucking 5 year olds. You see kids do the same thing.
Oh shit..Busted!!
Fuck! Abort! Abort! 
"Oh shit, it's the fuzz!"
"Now to make sure mom isn-"

"OH SHIT"
This is perfect definition for ‚Äúbusted‚Äù
When your parent catch you playing video games instead of doing your homework
You have a yarn ball out and you blame the cat?
Is that a skein of Mighty Stitch?! 
a ball of yarn to a cat and a no ? ...   


those two just dont go good together.
What?  You ain't seen nothin', nothin' I tells ya!
"Hey ma-SHIT SCATTER"
Back before she got arthritis, one of our cats used to jump onto the kitchen worktops.

We always chased her off of there, but it didn't dissuade her when she thought we wouldn't be there to chase her off.

Imagine her shock when I went downstairs into the kitchen at 2am and turned on the light. She tried sprinting forwards, but that was into the sink. She turned 90 degrees, that was facing the wall. Another 90 degrees, that was towards me. Another 90 degrees, she hopped off the counter and ran to the catflap. She didn't leave, but was obviously prepared to in the event I chased after her.

The daft bugger.
So cute
I'm sure you know this, but be careful with that yarn and the kitty! Had to pull a very long piece out of my cats ass once. We both were very uncomfortable during the experience...
I know you told him not to and he did it anyways, they‚Äôre assholes like that (cats).  Pllllleeaase don‚Äôt let your cat play with string, thread, yarn etc. Linear Foreign Bodies are no joke and can literally saw through that cat‚Äôs intestine.
Oops
[deleted]
cats are so hot right now
(Metal gear ‚Äú!‚Äù sound)
Loving what looks to be a DDR pad in the background, as well as the mischievous kitty!
Caught me on camera? Wasnt me.
This makes me so happy. Long story incoming. I was hanging out with a friend I don't see very often today. My wife texts me as we are out hanging telling me to come to the local pet store. So we go. Three of us are there and my friend and I can tell she is excited. She tells me that there are cats here from CARES, a local cat shelter that does everything they can to keep cats alive that are surrendered or given up. And I've volunteered there before with people I work with. We see a cute orange, grey and black one that keeps coming up to us. My friend is waiting outside but is basically looking at me like "you need to get that cat for you guys." So now we are going to be kitty parents. We are going to love and support little Scottie. She's only 5 months. Can't wait to finally adopt her and experience things like you have OP!
I don't know for sure if animals know how to curse, but I would be willing to bet anything at that moment he said "oh fuck" 
Hahaha the jump. Oh well hello there. 
*Loki impersonating Odin* "Oh shit"
That was the "oh shit" look for sure, had many cats through out my life. So funny.
Proof that they know exactly what they are doing.
[deleted]
One of my cats literally wraps my stairwell with yarn almost every night. Little asshole. 
Whats a cat do when you will leave such a strong temptation lying around..
This is an adorable video, but seriously, don't let your cats play with string y'all! It's common for it to get wrapped around their intestines and potentially kill them. 
lmao the little butt jump and runs the best
How do you expect a cat not to play with a ball of yarn!?
I mean to be fair it is a ball of string (I know yarn) that is literally every cat's favorite toy
r/bettereveryloop
Haha. He literally jumped. That was awesome!!! 
That look says busted as well as any kid caught with their hand in the proverbial cookie jar. 
Ahahahhaha that reaction üòÇ  Cats man...
Lil jump
Aww crap! Busted! \*flee! \*
The little shit knows he's not supposed to üòÇ

I see someone plays a lot of ddr.
Linear Foreign Bodies are no joke 
>"CRAP! It's old man u/stoicSalamander let's dip!"

Your cat probs.
Ah.... That's so funny..m that little jump when he sees you
Oh, my God, they found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty! 
He‚Äôll have plenty of yarns to tell his grandkittens. 
That was the moment he knew, he had fucked up.
I get that look daily with my kids, and then, "I wasn't doing the exact thing you told me not to do!"
He's just sorry he got caught.
Quick, someone more talented than me - add the exclamation point and sound from metal gear solid.
Busted.
‚ÄúOh no! The jig is up!‚Äù
Is that a DDR dance mat or am I crazy?


But yarn is irresistible!
I wasn't the one doing that.  It's just a coincidence.  Nothing to do with me.  Look away. 

!
Mine just does it while staring at me to ensure dominance. Isn‚Äôt the fact that I bought you a condo Lucy good enough? 
Our big boy, when my husband catches him scratching, stops, flops, and meows. He's so cute that my husband instantly fawns all over him.
‚ÄúShiet!‚Äù
Me in D2 cruicible when I hear a warlock coming with nova warp!
made it big on both subs, impressive
what is that black table thing?
That cat ran faster than when I face problems...
OH SHIT THE GIG IS UP!
One of the three of my cats was pooping in the living room, couldnt figure out which one neither why they were doing. After a few long months i caught one of my cats doing it, i never though in the world it would be her, i screamed at her, she looked at me, i looked at her, she continues to poop, i scream again, she finishes her poop looking at me and rans away....
I imagined an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù when he realized.
Whatcha makin‚Äô with that yarn?
"Fuck. They are here." 
"Well... Shit!"
Run
That wasssss hilarious 
Ahaha my cat does exactly the same.  
But she will continue doing the scratching and only run away when I'm close enough to stop her.  
She will also sometimes stop scratching, look at me challenging me raising the paw for a duel of who is faster, me catching her or her scratching the couch for 1 more second.

That's the reaction my 5y.o. makes when he's doing something I told him not to as well.
He cared?! Mine would just carry on.
C H O N K
My cat does the exact thing when I see him scratching on the couch. Lol
Cats are super sneaky about everything I recently switched to feeding both my cats wet cat food, and I used to get annoyed when my one cat would eat whatever was left in the other cats bowl, and snapped at her a few times.

To this day she will literally sit in front of the other cats bowl licking her lips UNTIL I walk away and do something then she goes right to eating it, until I come back into the kitchen then she stops and runs off
You can just mentally hear him saying "I did NOT touch that yarn!" as he zips around the corner.   


Apparently it's universal because my cats have the same reaction when I catch them on the counter . . . or other naughty things. 
That is one happy cat!
Busted! 

The look and little jump is hilarious.
To be fair, it is yarn and it is a cat.  There is almost no probability that you were ever going to keep them apart once you had both in the same house.  Cat gonna' Cat. ;)
 Not to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù (girl) but leaving string unattended with a cat is super dangerous. It can strangle them or they can swallow the string and this can cause an internal obstruction which can kill them. 

Source: I work with rescue cats and this happened with a cat I was looking after. I noticed he had string coming out of his bum. He had to go into emergency surgery where they found the string had wrapped around part of his intestine. Part of it had to be removed. 
Aww you should get him his own yarn. It‚Äôs the classic kitty toy.
Bad kitty!
r/StartledCats
Telling a cat not to do something, my sides.
Guilty as charged 
This is purfect! 
This is my,  Mr Slippers when I walk in on him destroying yet another bath towel by licking it to shreds. 
this should be proof that animals have an internal dialogue. 
oh yeah you repeatedly told me not to do that thing
Cat being cat
I wish my cat gave a crap when I catch him doing something he is not supposed to do.  
maybe buy a squirt gun?
We just got a new couch, in part because the cats turned our old one into a scratch post. That being said, they still try to claw the new one. We will yell at them, they will stare at us, make eye contact, and continue to scratch the new couch, as if to say, "Well, what are you going to do about it?"
it's a tactical retreat I suppose.
"oh fu- FUCK SHIT! OH MY GAW-!"
Oh! You^saw^nothing...
All 4 of the cats in my house do this when I'm trying to crochet, they think they're soo sneaky 
OP, what is that thing top left?? Laptop?
My cats will look me in the eye and do something I told them not to do.
We have our first cat now. I'm 37. Not really sold on cats yet...

They're smarter than I thought, but they're still pretty stupid.
Oh cool. I thought it was like a laptop or something with cool stickers. Thanks fir the reply üí™üèº
I wish any of my cats gave the slightest shit when I try to scold them. They either strut away or give me back chat.

Trio of pricks.
Yeah. Cats will do the thing if you aren't watching. When we got our current cat, we trained her to not go on work tops. I came down one morning and found tuffs of soft cat fur on the chopping board. 
That's so cute üòÖ our cats ignore us as they continue to shred the fabric on the couch, so the feeble cries to stop are now half-hearted and mostly a meme.
My girl would realize she had obeyed me, then go back and attack double time because how dare i tell her what to do.
Mine does the same shit when I catch her on the kitchen counter
Yeah, my cat was like that too.

Had a half of a good long sub on the table, hear a noise, look up from my book and the cat had hopped up on the table and was dragging the rest of my sub over to the edge.

Our eyes met and then we both took off at the same time.
They know more than we recognize 
Is that a DDR pad?
Oooo busted!
Haha that second long look. Hilarious!
My cat caused a lot of damage... nasty scratches on our leather couch and curtains, any advice?
Wow your cat listens *and* remembers? Lucky you
That is REALLY funny!
All I hear is,

# "BLYAT, it's my owner!"
I'm astounded that the cat gives even the remotest of fucks. I'm quite sure that's a dog in a cat suit. 
I‚Äôve never had a cat, can you actually train them not to do stuff or are they not smart enough/too stubborn?
I expected him to just keep doing it.
Cat hasn't learned, "Don't do it." Cat has learned, "Don't do it will OP is watching."

Damn cats.
Thank you, I needed a good laugh.  
I wish my cat cared enough when I caught her being bad.
I wish! My cat would just grab the yarn and dart off being careful to wrap the yarn around as many chair legs as possible during the chase.
I‚Äôve been in this situation with a couple pets. I say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that.‚Äù They wait until I‚Äôm not looking, do it, then wonder why they are in time out! A few times I caught them in the act like in this video. You ever just HATE something that you love?
My cat also likes to chew my yarn. But not the cheap acrylic stuff. Just the expensive natural, pretty hand dyed, or limited edition stuff. He will dive into boxes to get it. Sigh.
When I tell my cat to stop doing something, he talks back to me and then does it. Teenagers amirite?
Once I was watching my cats playing with a gopher home and couldn't be bothered to tell them off, and as soon as they realised I could set them one off then say on it and looked guilty. It was so hilarious I couldn't bring myself to tell at them.
When mine does stuff like this, she's trying to get my attention. The fact that this little guy's clearly just having fun makes it so much more precious. 
You can see the ‚Äúope!‚Äù
Haha that little jump he does and opens his eyes all wide... Reminds me of when a guard or something in a video game notices you and an exclamation mark pops up above their head. 
"It's the cops!  Cheese it!"
This is wholesome as hell

This reminds me of that cat eating peppermint and then bolting... 
That is so damn funny, he busted. 
When my cat is doing something he knows he's not supposed to do, he just keeps doing it while staring at me.
The jig is up!
My dog does this thing we‚Äôre if you tell him not to touch something or what ever he‚Äôll touch it slightly and keep doing that until you get up then he runs 
That moment of "Oh shit!" 
Nice slip into the cat dimension 
That made me laugh hard enough I scared my kitty as he was walking byüòÇ
Oh my god, he is super cute, running to hide, knowing he is in the wrong. So, its absolutely true that the cats know what you are conveying to them. They just act as if they have no idea what you are saying to them.üòÅ
It's darn cute they act like little kids in trouble
That's adorable!
Just like my cat. Even the fur is similar. I like to crochet, so every time I leave my yarn on the bed she starts to bite it and hide as soon as I call her name hahaha
We were expecting a baby and setup a crib in the bedroom a few months before he was born and it was hell keeping the cats out of it.  No matter how many times we sprayed them we would find them in it in the morning.  When the baby came home they wouldn't go near the crib when he was in it though. 
Well how else is he going to get you to chase him? Lol
Hahaha omgsh I love this shit. They are so fucken mischievous
Bwahahaha! Oh my gosh! The guilty startle and run! 
[The cat equivalent of this.](https://youtu.be/pHXg9oKoWak?t=37)
At least he's acknowledging he's wrong. Lol my cat just doubles down if i catch her being bad

#thuglyfe 
Oh shit, ABORT!!!
Adorable but can cause a GI blockage if the string is swallowed :/ seen it one too many times while working at a vet clinic

My cat has been doing this high speed staring thing where he jumps on the couch and then stares at me, as if to say "I am here, right near your face."
cats = zero fucks given
That's like putting cake in front of me and telling me not to eat it.
That is so damn cute!!!!
[deleted]
Sadly I don't have a cat, but I have a dog. He loves to lie on my clothes. Even though I do not want him to. I have to bring him onto the bathroom with me when I take a bath. Or he scratches at the door. I don't have anywhere to put my cl9thes except the floor. My apartment is small. Once I am in the Beth he knows I won't get out to get him off my clothes. He is super stubborn. 
Zoinks!!
Every damn time!

At least he quit. I have numerous scars from trying to stop my cat from chewing on my iPhone cord, which is her favorite chew toy. Telling her to stop has no effect whatsoever. (Nor has explaining the danger to her LOL.)

Who tells his cat not to play with a ball of yarn? It's the most quintessential cat play thing. Next I'm going to hear you tell your dog not to chew bones.

Cats can be trained. Looks like OP is doing a good job to me.

That is just adorable.
I'm thinking about getting a cat I'm more of a dog person but rn idk if I could give the dog the proper attention he needs..

Playing with a ball of yarn you left on the floor... I mean, you were asking for it with a cat. You knew what you were getting into 
so, cat?
Hahahahahaha 
**ESCAPE NINJUTSU!**
Don't let him play with yarn. He can get tangled up in it. Happens a lot, and he could choke and die.
Wait you have a cat and he's not allowed to play with yarn? What are you some kind of monster?
Be careful, cats will eat yarn and it can be deadly. My cat ate a bunch of yarn and it got stuck in his intestines. He got really sick and almost died until we shelled out 3k for surgery to remove it. 
They really do like to play with yarn :o

r/mildystartledcats 
How dis r/aww? 
You were too hard on your cat. You want him to be something other than a cat. He knows he can only act like a cat because that‚Äôs what he is.
your telling a cat not to play with yarn, that is red? thats like telling a frog not to jump or a snake not to stick its tung out....
They... Understand ?... 
Stop vertical video syndrome
Hot
is there a subreddit of cats feeling guilt?
Put a ball of string on the ground. Don't expect your cat to play with it. Right.
