I'm so used to seeing "100th" for posts about grandparents or great grandparents that I misread this and thought "there's no way in H E 🏒🏒 that woman is 100".  That's the exact moment I realized I am an idiot.
This is super wholesome! Thanks for sharing!
His face... he's got the expression of Baby Yoda
Your grandma rocks! And the are prolly close in age. Buddies
Happy birthday, lil bud!
HBD little buddy! And your grandma’s braids are adorable.

Can you do me a favor? Please
Give her a hug for me, I miss my Grannie
Her dog just looks so contempt, like it's just happy to be there
Can your grandma adopt me? I love her already

This is so sweet!
For a while I thought the macaron on top of the cake was meant to be another 0 and figured this lady looks really good for her 100th birthday. Then I read the title again. Well, happy birthday dog!

That pup is lucky to have a loving owner. Pup looks happy!
