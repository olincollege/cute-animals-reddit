The head tilt after you see the ducks at the feet is the best part
It's so perfectly round.
To be fair, Call Ducks (the type of duck shown here) are surprisingly affectionate. Originally they were bred to lure in other ducks to hunters/shooters but are no longer needed. They are also delightfully sized. Had two as a kid called Saruman and Gandalf.
Best buddies have your back when you are drunk and decide to leave the bar with a creepy dude.
My family used to have a pet duck that looked just like this lovely girl. We rescued her off my uncle's farm because she was being bullied by all the other hens and ducks. When she came to us she was skinny and half bald and over time she got nice and plump and round and had beautiful white feathers. Then we ate her.

Just kidding. We named her Pearl, she thought she was a dog and was madly in love with our actual dog. Used to follow him around the garden doing this weird mating neck dance thing at him. She'd curl up next to our cats and come chill out with you whenever you went outside. She hung out in our kitchen too sometimes. One time I saw her eat an entire frog. She was walking around with its back legs hanging out of her beak and a big bulge in her neck for ages. The legs took a long time to stop twitching. It was horrifying. 

Eventually we realised she was pining for her own babies so we got some fertilised eggs to hatch and after that she reverted fully back into duck mode and was never the same. Pearl was great.

Dude needs to get his ducks in a row 
Quackly go for the humans leg sticks! 
This is really interesting to me. Is this altruism? What do the other ducks have to gain from risking their own safety? I don't really think of ducks as social in the animals with systems the reward helping each other, like humans, apes, elephants, dolphins, etc. 
Be careful. Even though they're only knocking off 1hp per peck, eventually they'll get you.
"he stole da queen! peck him down my braddahs"
We had pet ducks and chickens growing up and i was never afraid of the chickens but the duck bites oh my gosh i dont even remember if it hurt it just scares me. Being chased by a duck as an adult is kind of embarassing

A duck in the hand is better than 2 on the foot.
I like how she tilts her head at the person holding her after they look down at the other ducks. It's like she's saying, "See what I have to deal with?"
This reminds me of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

The human being Grawp, the duck being Hermione, and Harry and Ron pecking away.

"GRAWP!  You put me down!  NOW!"
Duck shit. Duck shit everywhere. 
I want to keep her now too!
Oh just you wait. You will be sorry
Ducks are great!

I just got a few myself a few months ago. Did you know you can order one day-old ducklings through the mail? 

The babies were hilarious. Awkward and clumsy and messy! When they started quacking instead of peeping, I think they were more surprised than me.

I got ducks instead of chickens because I had read someplace that if you're allergic to eggs, you can eat duck eggs. Sure enough I finallly was eating eggs again.

One day a coyote came into my yard and grabbed a duck that I was HOLDING. I didn't let go. I held my duckie as she died.

Now I have built a giant duck compound with 6'ft high, razor wire topped fencing. 

I hope to wear that coyotes head as a hat one day.

Ducks are the best.
Quack.

Ducks have the most expressive faces for not having lips.
I love how at the last second they both look at each other and are like what the fuck are we doing?
There was a duck in the Netherlands which saved a woman from intruders. It made the news back then.
They just want to be held too.

I guess this is what it would be like if you were the boss in dark souls. 
I think ducks are a solid #2 contender behind kittens for adorable animals.
*Aggressive quacking
The quack looks like a quackndy cone :D
Ducks have razor sharp teeth 
That sideways look when it cuts back after the shot of the pecking says "Well, what did you expect?"

I love that the duck looks kind of confused.

Does anyone know if ducks are as ferocious as chickens? They seem so cute, but since they descend from dinosaurs, I'm cautious about approaching one. Even though there aren't a lot of ducks around, I suppose.

Ducks can be super aggressive! We had a mated pair and the male would relentlessly chase my male golden retriever- as in see the dog 30 yards away and start running at him. My golden would bark and growl but realized that running is easier than having a fearless drake latch onto his face and not let go. 
Dude was so chill he didn't give a duck
