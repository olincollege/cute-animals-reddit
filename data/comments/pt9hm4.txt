Dave doing all the hard work here and meanwhile we have Kevin over there who's just like "Oh yeah, charging cable!"
ive never seen a baby chameleon catch a bug! its adorable as all heck!
A friend of my parents gave my mom their veiled male chameleon because they didn‚Äôt want him anymore. About a month after we got him one tiny green baby chameleon mysteriously appeared in the cage. Turns out the previous owners had had a female in with the male and she had died after becoming egg bound. She must have managed to lay one before she passed because now we have a two month old chameleon named Pascal :)
I didn't know baby chameleons were so small
Dinner and a show!
All I can think about is the two bugs he missed that went behind the towel.  I‚Äôm hungry.
And people call me crazy because I have a spider in my bathroom that's the size of a 50¬¢ piece. I have a lot of ants in there. He's getting them.
Jesus, I don‚Äôt know how close your hand was to the wall, but it almost looks like their tongue is longer than their body.
Hi everyone, I appreciate the humor in this, but insects crawling through the house are likely to be exposed household chemicals, bacteria, pesticides, and other things they picked up while crawling around which may make a chameleon sick. 

I made this mistake and I don't have a chameleon anymore. Sorry to be a downer.
Isn‚Äôt it dangerous to feed bugs without knowing where they came from?
Since you're using your chameleons to get karma on Reddit, does that make the Karma chameleons?
I wish these wouldn't die if you looked at them wrong.
Hope the bugs don't go into the socket...
Why have I been paying for a pest control guy when I can just own a chameleon?
there is still one under your towel!
I love chameleons they have the funniest little hands üòÇ
The one stretching over to the cable is adorable.
The other one is vegan, I guess.
The way the little hommie reaches for the cable kills me
I love baby chameleons.  They are born from day one as an exact replica of adults. They have all the instincts and hunting skills the adults do from the jump.
TIL I need baby chameleons in my life and my kitchen
This is my first time seeing baby chameleons. They are so cute! Do baby chameleons change color or does that happen later?
If they charge by the hour, the labour costs on the bill will be crazy.
omg my heart
This wins
It's tongue lashing IRL!

I want a baby chameleon please
OMG they so cute, I wanna one üòç
I remember going to sleep in my dorm room on Clark AB, Philippines, listening to the geckos in my room and appreciating the pest control service they continuously provide me.  Most people hated the buggers for the noise they made.  The noise was annoying at times, but a small price to pay for not getting eaten alive in my sleep.
Well that‚Äôs fucking adorable
Adorable killers.
Yo those are dope
That accuracy is incredible
My house is now infested with chameleons!  

I think so, anyway.  Haven't seen any.
I ain't never seen baby chameleons before, they're so cute
Could I make a vest full of them to protect me against mosquitos?
That's gotta be the most adorable thing I've seen a while. Loved it
I thought at first, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not close enough,‚Äù then, zing!
How the little chameleon reaches out for the cable omgüò≠üò≠üò≠ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
I love the little dude on the left - "oh hey, what's dis? monkey bars? must play!"
It's like a magic ring that catches bugs. I need to get me one of those sticky tongue flyswatters.
This is *not* "aww."

Please don't feed your reptiles random wild insects. 

It's the equivalent of letting your dog eat random trash or roadkill.

It's not healthy for them, there could be pesticides or parasites, and there are ample feeder insect resources.
Go, babies!
I just know I would have switched the babies and made sure they got one little snack each lol
I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre so comfortable on your hand already! Our baby is I would guess 3-4 months old and we‚Äôve only had him a week so we‚Äôre just letting him get used to his cage. He is my little boys pet and we‚Äôre really hoping he‚Äôll be able to handle him one day - any tips for making him more comfortable with us?

Also yours are a really light green. Ours was the same when he arrived but started to go brownish-green with black stripes. He gets a white lateral stripe when he is stressed (we think). He‚Äôs been shedding so I‚Äôm trying not to read too much into his dark colours. Would you say this light green is a good indicator that they‚Äôre relaxed? He is a blue panther.
Karma, karma, karma, I want a chameleon
How many insects can they eat a day?
Oh my god!! Sooo damn cute!!
How are chameleons as pets? Not looking to get one, just curious
Are chameleons half tongue? That almost looked longer than its' body.
I live in Savannah (= there are all sorts of bugs). Guess I need some chameleons ü¶éüíö
This is the first time I've ever seen a baby chameleon! I had no idea that they would be so tiny! Omg. They fit just comfortably on a cable. That's just too cute üòç
nifty. cute little buggers
That some looooong ass tongue!
I got fruit flies, i soo need baby chameleons!
We need that in super slow motion.
Too freaking cute.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Nice!. Can we have next one of them crawl into that outlet and cause a short circuit. And you can make a taste test content with them after they fried there a bit. Nice disco AND an after party snack¬ø Now that's wholesome ü§óü§óü§óü§ó
"We've got so many mice we're starting to get owls."
Marty did this on an episode of Fraiser!!! It was a gecko and he put a piece of floss around the gecko like a leash so it wouldn't escape. Him and Fraiser used it to hunt down a rouge cricket in their apartment lmao
I need a damned anteater stat
Now that‚Äôs going green for the environment
they're so teeny
its crazy how a big tongue can fit in a small body, they're such tiny things :o
A third one crawled up behind the towel and there may have been a 4th stationary one behind the towel
Seems like the chameleon ate the gomu gomu fruitüòÇ
Opensuse
It's all fun and games until one of those little guys sticks his tongue in the electrical socket.
Okay bro but you just have tiny bugs crawling up your walls like it‚Äôs normal?
I need these
I wonder if an adult would be tough enough to safely keep an eye out for the accursed house centipedes that plague my apt building.

I regularly leave spiders of all sizes alone in my home or at worst move them safely outside but fuuuuuck those house centipedes. I am far from an insectophobe but those guys are something else
THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO MORE UNDER THE TOWEL!   For God‚Äôs sake, man!!!
Wow I would love chameleons just hanging around my place to take care of pests. But my cat might not appreciate it as much.
*DISCLAIMER*
The original video (tiktok) explains that the flies were placed there by the owner, they are not wild flies.

Please don't feed your reptiles wild bugs
Are their tongues longer than their bodies
God damn those would of been so helpful during the summer when out of no where there was like 20 horseflies in my house. Killed them for like a week straight till they stopped showing up. So weird to me. Would of loved these guys.
I love these creatures. I had a really hard time keeping their habitat at the proper temperature and humidity.
They‚Äôre like the sloths of the reptile world.
Wow ‚Ä¶. I didn‚Äôt even see the 3rd one until watching for the 3rd time lol
My office desperately needs these guys
Note to self, get a chameleon and have it live on the produce shelf counter
More effective than my monthly Orkin treatments for sure
Your fucking hired
Do they still sell that beach babe spray anywhere? I feel like I haven‚Äôt seen it in so long and John Frieda‚Äôs spray is so expensive.
Lil grabbies!
[deleted]
Give. Me. One.
Sir, you have an infestation
They're illegally small
Damn! Babies be tiny! Best pest control ever!
I used to do this with my cats. Either point at the bug or lift them and let them swat it and play with it. Great fun all around.
I currently have a gnat problem. Maybe I should get a chameleon
awwwwww, they're so cute!!!
How come in my whole life I've never seen a baby chameleon up until now? Who has been hiding the babies from me!
Weird question, but would having frogs in an artificial pond achieve this for mosquitos, or would I need a cave of 300,000 bats?
One is helping, the other is just clowning around, not pulling it weight.
Well I need to get me one of those to catch fruit flies! The outside trash is so close to my building they are always around! It drives me nuts!
This is one of the main reasons I would get a pet frog, salamander, or lizard.
That‚Äôs awesome! Just FYI though, there were two more critters that were crawling behind the towel!!
Ahhh ive never seena baby chameleon before they're so smol
the range is impressive!
Oh man, years ago I used to do this with baby chameleons whenever I found them. They are very effective in getting rid of annoying flies. Now I miss those times...
so cuuuuteeeeee!!!!!!!!
I see you, I love you, and I can see I am in the right place! 

I can hear the chirp sound of chameleons!
This was not on the list of fruit fly traps
I have a moth problem, where do I get me some baby chameleons
The one on the chord looks like Kermit the frog at the end.
Could you just have one of these live inside of a houseplant? I have a potted hibiscus that is like 5 feet tall, 4 ft wide. That dude could have a buncha bugs to eat.
That is so cool!
Please someone add the yoshi sounds
So cool
I want one.
Am I the only one hearing Yoshi sounds?
Question: are chameleons viable as pest control? I've three cats and they're quite garbage at catching flies
It's all fun and games until a bug crawls into the electrical socket
Found my new cannabis sativa growing team
I like it! Thanks
Ok but why do you just have bugs crawling on your wall
I suddenly really want a pet chameleon.
Super cute, just got sorry to learn they are actually fruit flies, not mosquitoes. I'm not in favor of live feeding but the damned bloodsuckers deserve it:-)

I've read OP is not the owner of the chameleons, but please, whoever is, don't let any of them get electrocuted. It would be better to put a protective plug in the vacant socket and see that they don't go near the connecting parts so as to avoid any risks.
Chameleon-man...Chameleon-man...does whatever a chameleon can...
You missed the one behind the towel
Only ONE of those chameleons is helping, the other is on some other shit down there climbing up the cable üòÇ
Can I borrow them? Trying to clear up a fruit fly problem.
Baby chameleon crawling on charger. 

BABY CHAMELEON CRAWLING ON FKN CHARGER.

I didn't know I needed it until I saw it.
Son of a bitch. Now I want a pet chameleon
Can I let a bunch of these roam my house and iron dome me from mosquitos?
I'm just imagining the perspective from the ant and suddenly this video is not suitable for this subreddit
I need to get me one of these for fruit fly season
They are so sublimely cute.   Thanks for sharing this!!
These chameleons would be good to have on my hat in Australia
I love how the other one just reaches for the cable
Ok but imagine this from the bugs perspective, a fucking giant holding up tongue monsters only to see your mate next to you be sucked into the depths of said tongue monster. Oh and now you‚Äôre the only one left.
I need fifty of those little guys to get the fruit flies in my house. Oh and they are cute as heck.
Here's some Karma for that Chameleon
where do they store all of dat tongue
Yes. Good bois.
Good guy chameleon deals with the bugs.
Bad guy chameleon tries to unplug your phone.
Chameleons look like lizard sloths
Good boiiii
Unless those are feeders you released your really putting those two at risk for parasites :(
Alright folks some comments on this vid are accusing me or the original owner of those chameleons for abusing them by feeding random bugs but they're in fact feeder fruit flies purchased at a pet store and the owner released them near the wall to feed them. Please be careful not to make false assumptions and throw insults before knowing the full facts. 
Thank you üôèüèª
Nice! Working for room and board! Lol

Seriously though I don‚Äôt know what those bugs are, but if you see more you might wanna call pest control. I noticed one on the other side of the outlet too.
[removed]
You really REALLY shouldn't be doing that.
Primarily why I want a bearded dragon but the missus don't want one. We do have baby lizards running around our backyard at least I hope they are doing work and the occasional possum. Probably why I haven't seen any ticks.

But ants. I hate ants.
Aside from being cute to watch, it‚Äòs an environmentally friendly way of insect control!
r/chameleonswithjobs?
Most adorable pest control ever!!!!

ü•∞üíïü¶é
I'm doing it old-school way - lifting up a cat
Is no one pointing out that those are literally bed bugs? This person is living in a bug infested room, and it's on r/aww....they are crawling all over the wall u can see at the end of the curtain jesus
r/babychameleonswithjobs
Good dog
Hands down best form of pest control
This is brilliant!  Perhaps my favorite Reddit vid of all-time!!  

Can these little ones survive northern Michigan winters with the right care?  I could fatten these mini exterminators on fall flies
just btw it's generally frowned upon to feed your animal wild bugs that could contain parasites. chameleon groups will metaphorically tear you apart and feed you to the dogs for posting something like this lol
Pretty sure that USB charger is a hidden camera...
Badass! We handhold our cats to catch flies in the ceiling.
Chameleon are notoriously difficult to care for and require at least 1 vet visit every year so feeding them wild caught insects is a terrible idea
This is awesome! They‚Äôre so tiny and cute
Hmmm‚Ä¶. That looks nice‚Ä¶ I want some baby chammy.
r/Bossfight
I spent a year in Australia and still to this day one of the things I miss the most (aside from their amazing beaches) are the geckos. I just loved seeing geckos running around everywhere. They were great pest control to have around, and they were absolutely adorable.

Now I'm back home in Canada and I have a few too many spiders around my place and I wish I had a couple geckos running around!
Are they fragile? I've seen baby geckoes literally die of a heart attack if you disturbed them.
BIG mlem
I LOVE THIS! So cute and helpful!
I love them
The one on the finger is definitely a Larry
dang ive never seen somthing that cute wered  you get them i want one
Very hard to tell but those kinda look like bedbugs, and they love outlets.
They are so fucking cool I wish I could get one, maybe in a few years
BE AFRAID, I AM DUAL WEILDING THEM
Ok those little lizards are cute af, but that insect clean up has me seriously ready to get a pet chameleon. Maybe a silly question, but do you ever "lose" them? I imagine they're in some sort of terrarium most of the time, but I have no idea how effective their camo is
My chameleon never liked being handled
Soooooo, you have some of these guys for rent? /s
Could use some help getting rid of some fruit flys lmao
Trying to talk my wife into us getting one.
Dude in the cord wasn't helping at all.
Today I learned I want some baby chameleons!
My family had a veiled chameleon when I was a kid. He was awesome! Very friendly and had fantastic aim! He could zap a cricket right from your fingers. I also love their grippy mitten feet! They are cool to handle because you can feel them grip and hold onto you rather than them just walking on you like most reptiles would.
They‚Äôre adorable
Insert yoshi merong sound effects
Chameleons are the Sloths of the reptiles.
I have never wanted a reptile pet until now. That little one reaching for the cord - adorable!
Bro yes
Those mfers small
The moves are slow but the tongue is fast
Welll... one of them is helping at least,  lol
Do these eat cockroaches and/or crickets as well?
the one guy missed out on a great snack
Dude that is such a good hair product
omg I want
I'm now convinced I need a few in case I ever have a bug problem...
Giv
The left one just likes that cable
Holy shit.  That reach is incredible
I want the Yoshi tongue grab sound to be in this.
Gotta fight nature with nature
I want one
How about using Raid? It kills bugs dead
That's so friggin CUUUUUTE!!
He looked back at op! I did it pa
Well, one is helping. The other is a lazy fark.
One: Eats bugs  
  
The Other: I know a branch when I see one.
cuties!
I freaking love chameleons!
omg,very cute
This needs to be posted in oddlysatisfying, I love it.
The way he grabbed onto that wire in what looks like slow motion was so freaking cute.
I like Chameleons....they just seem like very chill creatures...
Whatcha gonna do when their existing food is running out?
Well, one is helping‚Ä¶
They are so fucking cool
Love this!!
I fucking want one. No, not one, I want two.
I've never wanted a baby chameleon before...

First time for everything I suppose
No better way to decimate an intrusive ant issue, clearly.

I WANT THEM
that little dude in the left really struck a chord with me!
my heart
Adorable! Especially the one reaching for the wire, like "nah, i just want to hang over here".
Why are there so many bugs in your house?
AWWW
Love how one of them instantly decided they didnt want any part of that
Idk what I was expecting but it wasn‚Äôt this. I am pleasantly surprised
I'll take one in every colour!

Wait...
I love them forever
That's good work!
That you have that many to begin with bothers me. Are you not using mosquito bits and fruit fly catchers?
I for some reason never imagined chameleons as babies
Their little hands üòç So freaking cute.
That was effin awesome!!!!
Very satisfying to see..  I watched it multiple times!  Thanks and please post more OR consider a sub-Reddit
Omg I have a fruit fly problem because my roommate doesn‚Äôt take care of the trash they she makes.. I need to borrow someone‚Äôs little chameleons
So tiny
Reminds me of the first Men in Black movie üé•
What would it be like if humans had a tongue that was as long as their bodies?
This is the best video ever!
the way the other one grabbed the chord and started crawling on it has to be the cutest thing i‚Äôve seen all day
Look at their tiny hands, they are adorable!
I want a chameleon so bad. One day.
What happens when the bugs come out the socket?
Amazing
Very nice. How much?
I love chameleons and geckos.
The other one strrrreeeeettttcccchhhhiiinnngggg for the cord had me dying lol
Good god these are cute.
When you have a group project to finish‚Ä¶
Thought that bug was on my screen
No dad! I want to be an electrician!
I love these creatures. I had a really hard time keeping their habitat at the proper temperature and humidity.
Chameleon* the other one was sitting around being cute! Fine, he was helping
Turned volume on max hoping to hear Yoshi eating noises.
Nice
Omg literally adorable
Omg so cute
This is so cool! I want to walk around in my blazer, with my baby chameleons on my fingers.

Vzhzhzhzhzoooot, vzhzhzhzhzhzhoot.
I love that Beach Babe spray!
I love Jackson chameleons‚Ä¶.
Chameleons are beyond one of the coolest animals ever.
Wild bugs are parasite havens and you shouldn't feed them to your pets

Why do you have chameleons? Is that legal where you are?
Why do you have chameleons? Is that legal where you are?
Should have had them at my job today because Fruit Flys were everywhere!

What that tongue do
Where do I buy one of these???

Ever since I have seen all those videos with parasites crawling out of dead insects I would not want my pet chameleon to eat random insects crawling around my house

Those videos are nightmare fuel

Ok I need pet lizards
It looks like they move in slow motion
I WANT BABY CHAMELEONS!!!
 Naww dude don‚Äôt do that.
I cannot believe this hasn't been overlaid with the Yoshi Eating sound. I dunno how to do it myself, but surely someone, *some*where has the ability??
Very cute
What chameleons?
I want one
I need these in my kitchen for the fruit and drain flies in the summer
Catch those annoying flies in summer by putting the little guy on the end of your finger and pointing at it mid flight‚Ä¶ the amazement of watching the fly get snapped out of mid air NEVER gets old! üòØ
Hahaha, yes, dieeeee‚Ä¶.
Wonder if they can live with my cat

Man can I rent a few for a day? Lol
I want hours of this

For some reason this 10 second gif just brought me back in time 25+ years‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in the school library with my dad at my schools book fare. I pick up a book that would become one of my favorite childhood books. The iguana brothers.

Thank you for the lessons you taught me, Dom and Tom. Thank you for reading to me Dad. I love and miss all of you.
Ahhhh, friggin awesome!
I wish we could get chameleons here, but i guess we have monitor lizards and Frilled lizards, but not chameleons how sad
Are those bedbugs?
Smack, smack Zapp!
Fucking cuuuute!
Fucking cute!
Holy shit that‚Äôs a longue ass tongue
This may be my favorite video.

Nice! Go little buddies!
The void knight was killed, another of our order has fallen and that island lost.
Those tiny hands!
This is cute, but good keepers don't let their reptiles eat wild insects due to the risk of parasites and pesticides.
Cutest boogers ever!
Oh geez so cute.
This was oddly satisfying to watch. Cute and accurate! Love it! Wish I had some of those to eat all these gnats. All I have are these ugly daddy long leg spiders hanging around.
frick they're cute
Any chameleon owners here? Do they require a lot of upkeep to have as pets?
Such cool little creatures!
*Yoshi noises*
So I need baby chameleons on my indoor plants?
I need to borrow these guys
soooooo cute!
i love this
They are so stinking cute!
That was awesome
Ah, they brought good karma, one might say they are ‚Äúkarma chameleons!‚Äù
I need yoshi sounds with this plz
Thanks mom.
That‚Äôs so cool
Awesomest thing I've seen this month! Not even close.
If this were a boss fight, you‚Äôd dodge the instant you see the tongue
God I‚Äôm so horrible I was watching and thought, ‚ÄúI wonder what would happen if they stuck there tongue in the socket‚Äù
I‚Äôll take one for each finger please
That beach babe spray is the shit though fr
Their tongues are amazing even at that age. I‚Äôve never experienced reptile tongue first hand except for feeding the iguanas lettuce in Aruba several times but I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôre much stickier.
He understood the assignment
So cool!
That one chameleon: ‚ÄúG I V E M E T H E C A B L E‚Äù
I needed this in my life.  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Someone edit this clip with the Yoshi licking sound.
Karma. From chameleons. This could be a hit song.
Ive heard people mention not to use chameleons or frogs to get rid of household pests. You don't know where the bugs could have been previously. They might be covered in some sort of insecticide or maybe fecal matter. They could even carry parasites. This can be especially dangerous to baby chameleons which are even more sense give than adults. Store bought or home raised crickets or other insects is the only safe bet.
This reminds me of the time I went to my daughter‚Äôs 2nd grade open house. The teacher had a terrarium full of about a dozen baby chameleons all grasping their way from one branch to the next and it was right in front of where I was sitting and I literally did not hear a single word the teacher said that night. 

Fortunately my (non-ADHD) husband was there also.
This is the cutest freaking thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Maybe this is what I need to keep the aphids off my Aerogarden
I‚Äôll take one of these while I wait at the bus stop
Omg, They're adorable and I want one.
Looks like someone is earning their keep.  Both are cute, so it is a win for all.

If only they weren't so difficult to keep properly housed and healthy. So cute!

So cute
This is really cool!
I'm more concerned about the number of ticks/bedbugs you have going on.
Sniper boi
Wow, that's very nice
Their both gonna b ‚Äúcrispy chameleons‚Äù if they keep playin on that electric cord
They are the elite team
Holy crap didn‚Äôt realise how tiny they are as babies.
Man, imagine if we could communicate with them. "Hey, you can live here just eat all the pests you find, deal?"
The fact that baby chameleons are this small just makes me want to squeal like it‚Äôs 2011 and I‚Äôm at a 1D concert
Only commenting so I can show my nephew, we had quite the discussion about chameleons today.
Now I want a couple of baby chameleons. They seem like they would be awesome.
Awwwww
I could use one of those
Okay this is the cutest thing I've ever seen. I need one
My god they're adorable
So cuuuute![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)

They do a great job!
I have those pesty little bugs around the kitchen sometimes...I need a chameleon!
Cable guy is not pulling his weight though.
That's lucky. It can be tough to catch them why they eat.
Can someone add yoshi tongue noises to this?
Where do they keep that tongue at? Like that thing is as long as it's body it seems.

Seriously, is it just rolled up in its mouth?
Hopefully these are feeder insects, never feed a pet reptile wild insects as they can carry all sorts of parasites and diseases. Always use insects that are bred for feeding
I need this with Yoshi sound effects.
Nice aim for a kid
Oml I need one
Alright reddit tell me why it's not not a good idea to breed chameleons and end up with a bunch of babies

Just a general tip: don't get into the habit of feeding wild insects to your pets.

If you buy feeders then you can lesser the likelihood that they had parasites or diseases. Ideally they were fed fruits, but even if they weren't then the worse you'll get is cardboard.

But the worse that you'll get with wild insects is that they came in from eating roadkill and poop.
