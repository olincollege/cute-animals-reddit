There was this guy I knew who ran an exotic bird show. He had a couple really colourful parrots, an owl, a falcon, and this little parakeet who would go with him just to hang out.

That parakeet was the chillest, sweetest bird ever. He would hop up on your hand and put his head down for preening, and when you stopped preening him he would climb up your arm, sit on your shoulder and preen you.
Proving that the bird actually wants the pets.
Did you forget? That's OK, he'll help you!
"*...well?*

Must I do *everything* myself around here...?"
I imagine with your hand just being there, it felt the warmth of your hand and thought "ooh... Ooohhh gonna snuggle in that" 🥰
“Good little dinosaur”
My Green Cheek died a few weeks ago. He was with us for six years and I keep finding myself going to give him scraps whenever I cut fruit or veggies. Snuggle your birdy as much as you can for me.
My heart is breaking.
I have a cat that will come from across the room to do this if you hold out your hand.
why are birbs so cute??
That’s beyond cute
That little backwards scoot !
I love how he positions himself so that the thumb is at the tip of his head, the best snuggle position!
That's a cute bird
Cute little birb ( ꈍᴗꈍ)
This is why it wouldn't work with my dog.

The second my hand goes anywhere near my dogs head-level he starts charging towards it expecting a head scritch. 

If I so much as leave my hand hanging over the edge of my sofa arm he will barrel down my hallway and into my living room, then push his head into my hand.
This is THE sweetest thing I have seen all day... Maybe all MONTH!
> Challenge

The word trend still exists.
r/petthedamnbirb
Who is this "someone"? Where is credit?
'Challenge' doesn't mean what it used to mean I guess...

But yes that is cute.
I know there is something... 

...I'm supposed to do here.
Such a sweetheart!
Naaaawh, this is so cute.
Aww that sidle and snuggle! <3
At first glance I thought the person may get bitten, but then..... my heart just melted. Too gorgeous ❤❤
I can’t cuddle me for you, but I can cuddle you!
My GCC does that
AAAAWWWWWWWWWWW22E
The suspense was killing me!
That’s absolutely the cutest thing I’ve seen since March
People are so dumb nowadays that they think doing this is a “challenge”?
Birb really trusts it's owner. Usually, when there's a huge moving/swooping objects in the air, their instincts kick in and birds become wary/fly off to avoid predation.
“challenge”
That sounds like a challenge meant to piss off reddit. Pet the damn birb.
Are you teasing me? Or are you pleasing me?
>challenge
The word challenge has lost all meaning.
> challenge

You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
where's the fucking challenge
Holy fkng jesus this is so awwww omg.
My one would just slaughter my hand before I even could try to bring it near him
The fingers pull the bird closer
I wish I had the time for a bird, love them.
Try that with cat.

&#x200B;

*Pain is temporary, fear is eternal.*
"Fine, I'll do it myself"
Challenges are getting more challenging these days
Docking.
Now i really want a bird
Wtf 800 awards
My yorkie started licking my hand
Why is this a challenge?
Lol so cute
Interesting, this drone is drawn to the heat signature from this humans hand. Must be a new update to the firmware.

Unpopular opinion: These aren't challenges, they are teasing their pet.
Damn, this is the cutest thing ever.
“It’s okay I’ll come to you!”
Aww love that!!
What a good little mango
That blink like “well I’m waiting”
Had to wait for it .. but gave me the biggest smile and wellbeing feeling for the day.

Thx for this post.
Also works on cats.
OH MY GOD :(

This is the cutest thing I've ever seen!
It's ok, everyone gets tired. I'll meet you halfway.
I'm the only person awake in my house right now so I had to quietly squeal into a pillow bc it just exploded out of me. This is SO CUTE
My bird would bite me and fly away if i did that
I'm scared of birbs but I really want one.
MY HEART
u/eatingplutonium cute birberino
I tried with my cat. 

The next thing I did was need stitches.
[deleted]
AUDITORY AWE OMG CAME OUT OF ME
Awww so cute
So worth the waiting
Parrots are so cuuuute. I want one!
I can't get over how adorably patient this creature is before he finally snuggles into that hand... Uugh, my heart.
Tried that on my cat and she just started rubbing her head on my hand like cats do.
I love green cheek conures. They have the best personalities!
Birb
that is one very cute birb you got there
Me when I’m going to bed and my bf doesn’t cuddle me automatically
My birds would have bit the shit out of my finger. They loved getting pet but not seeing the fingers coming. They were little paradoxal shitheads I miss them
Birb
That’s not a challenge, that’s just stupid
I want a birb now
This is very adorable . The bird was like “man are you petting me or not”? Since the mountain couldn’t come to Moses , Moses had to go to the mountain 🤣
My cockatiel would just flip the fuck out and bite my fingers to shit
Lost my bird a few months ago and seeing this brings back so many good memories of him
These awards are getting outta hand
Ahh the good ol’ 90/10 rule from the movie Hitch starring Will Smith.
Awww that so tweet ...
I know this is birds but I do this with my cat lol because she’s so neurotic she won’t sit still. The more I deny her the more willing she is to sit still for me 😂
how is this a challenge
Does anyone have any links to videos of the challenge with the dog?
My Trevor does that all the time...we call it his "love lean".
I tried this with my hedgehog. He puffed up and head-butted me, quills first.
My cockatiel doesn't even wait for you to put your hand out 😆 She just waddles along the sofa, jumps over onto my shoulder, climbs down to my chest and sits there with her head bowed until you give her scritches. No scritches... You get stitches!
Ok, this is one of those wait for its that I thought was worth
I don’t see the credit where this person got it but it’s from tiktok by @charlieNeebs and this the link of the original video:
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJApbbec/
And that's how to get what you want!
The way he just poofs up lol
What if I hold you like an ice cream cone?
Wow
Nice dog you got there
Kind of expected the bird to go for a lil chomp
Does anyone know where the original with the cat or the dog is? Could someone link it below?
Video is reverted?
What’s a “bird”? Is that some kind of new drone?

Why in the fuck does this have OVER 1000 AWARDS????
I love it that if 43 yr old me throws my arms up in the air like a toddler my husband will be ‘what?!’ then come in to hug me.  Hugs are visceral on all platforms.
Don’t especially like that challenge. They deserve all the pets.
Omg I cant 😭😭😭😭😭
The way the little bird shuffles in and closes its eyes 🥺🥺🥺♥️
I fucking hate how it’s called a “challenge” along with other crap on tic tok
>challenge

No it fucking isn't. Stop calling it that.
I went from 🤨 to 🥺😫
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Snuggle and Relax (that's how you do it)

Does this work on women?
This is so adorable! what kind of bird is it?
I'm the asshole skeptic who thinks the bird was trained because the person twitched their hand in a cup shape and then the bird came.

Edit: Actually it really doesn't seem like what I said above, because they had their hand shaped like that in the beginning. I think the bird just saw a good opportunity to snuggle.
I hate this. It hurts me inside. Just pet the bird already.
Having a pet bird is cruel.

r/titlegore
"Challenge" huh? That's not how challenges worked in my day. This is like "pranks" that aren't actually pranks.

How about this challenge? I challenge you to sleep when you're tired next time. Wow!
my heart exploded 💘💕💞
AWWWWW 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
OMG, the tension! Phew
Awww cute cute.
I need to see more like this.
That just melted my heart
This is really really adorable! 🥰
The suspense
I tried it with my cat and she doesnt even care lol
you can see him visibly resist the urge to pet
The click pattern reminds me of salmon. Weird, huh?
Lemme help you out a bit
So cute.
Curse of the reddit video player strikes again.
I was confused when I saw an apple, but then it turned in to a bird and it made sense.
I needed this after my 12 hour shift. Thank you
I just tried this with my toddler. He said “I don’t like it” and pushed my hand away.
Your hand was like a warm little cave for it to rest in.
I have a green cheek conure too and she loves to do this. I'll move my hand and she'll follow it anywhere
My pineapple does this too!
He was nowhere near the 298
Made me say "aww" out loud before I saw what sub this was from. Take my upvote.
This is a nice video and good color of parrots. some birds are too much cute.
So cute
Pet me HOOMAN!
How to train your bird
Waits patiently
Shit that's cute!
awhh
*blink* 🥰
That was so sweet!
What kind of bird is this?
I was totally waiting for the bird to bite his hand.
I tried doing this with my cat. She got mad and bit me
that's just sweet as pie
Always good to get proof of consent by video.
Scoot, scoot, warms c:
Cockatease 
(You can tell me that that's not a cockatiel, my business is dad jokes not biology)
The arm rest behind the bird looks like a dog
Mammals... they can't even pet right.
I saw one with a little snake. And the snake waited and finally kinda put its head in the guys hand. It was cute too.
very sweet and so very lovely bird!
Soooo cute 🥺
If I did this my cat would just attack me.
I call this "auto pat" mode. If I'm too lazy to do my one job as human, I'll just hang my arm off the couch and my dog will walk back and forth or in circles to get continuous pats. This inevitably ends with me giving in and picking her up to give real pats.
Almost like you are talking about!
A lot of people don’t know how affectionate birds can be.
This is like when I form the big spoon in the general vicinity of my girlfriend.
I'm gonna need to see more proof that this challenge is a thing.
My little conure does this too. I call it the magnet. Put your hand on the couch 5 ft away and he side waddles right over into it.
Pet the damn bird
This hand was made for me.
Assume the position
The bird was like: *thanos voice* “fine, I guess I’ll do it myself”
Now you must always pet the birb
Bird was like, am I gonna make the first move ?
The bird isn't good at math and just needed time to perform the calculation.
Aww so cute
This is from tiktok, though apparently OP didn't feel like giving credit to the person who made it.
all right i will do it myself.
Loved it!
The bird is in fact the word
Bird- It’s okay I will come to you
“Fine. I’ll do it myself”
Not sure how you programmed that robot to do that
My GCC Star does this. She immediately leans in the hand without hesitation. We have her out of her cage pretty much most of the day and typically only put her up for bed time. She is on my shoulder right now as I type this, just preening herself and being a happy little birb.
That's a nice *birb* right there
Omg so cute!! But i have angry birbs at home. So I’ll try this with my cat.
Poor bird. Can't fly inside of an apartment
Awww she looks my little Olive that I used to have. Such fun little birds
People are using the term challenge much too lightly these day
Beautiful little bird.
This video made me do the loudest "awww" in my life
This is super sweet!
What a sweetheart
Birds usually freak me out, but this was adorable. ❤️
What type of bird is this? :)
OMGosh, this is one of the cutest, sweetest things I've seen all week. I'm being overwhelmed by the cute!!!
AWWW!
Sweet baby
Let me see you back that ass up.
Im dying of cuteness
I snickered to myself and legit said ‘awwww.’
Das dumbb
I feel like everyone has an auntie or grandma who has that chair in the background.
Omg my heart. That was so sweet
Is that a green-cheeked conure? My dad carried one around on his shoulder everywhere he went for years. RIP Bullet. He was a great lil guy.
The sheer amount of joy in his eyes
Polly want a pet!
B I R B
have a budgie, sometimes he does snuggle up to me like this
Pretty cute that’s a mango, but I’m no expert
This is the best thing I have seen on reddit
Awesome
Not exactly a challenge now is it
please sir, may I have some more wholesome juice?
🙄🙄
it was like " homan stopped working ....... let me give it a start "..
Post more videos of this challenge pls
We must know the name of this birb
oh my goodness that’s adorable
My green cheek conure does that too. He loves to just cuddle in your hand and sleep.
But that blanket be looking like raw salmon filet
I am the same color bird
Omg. That got a legitimate *audible* "Awwwwwwwww" out of me! 

Jesus that was adorable
What a sweet little bird! 🥰
Weird looking dog
Love this
"challenge"

tiktok wannabe e-celebs really pushing the boundaries on exciting new talent these days huh
Awww what a sweetie!
the wiggle into ur hand 🥰
That is the sweetest of mangos.
Oh, they are sooooo smart!
Yes we need more burbs and cats and other animals. Not human babies. That guy was right
Thats so cute
That is sooooo freaking adorable. I would do it with my parrot as well but unfortunately we are arch enemies so yeah. She only likes my mom for some reason
That bird is definitely at grandma’s house. Mustard yellow blanket and flower pattern chair are dead giveaways lol
That was super cute, but how is this a challenge?

What's remotely challenging about it?
The sweetest lil birb there ever was
Omg that was so cute
PET THE DAMN BIRD... JESUS!
I tried it with the my cat and now I don’t have a hand anymore..
I want a bird too
I’ve been out of the bird game for a while so is that a lovebird or a conure ?

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️This is mainly why I always dissuade my friends from getting birds.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"""""""Challenge"""""""
So cute!
Cute! Where do I find the dog videos, I haven’t seen any like this!?
My sister's conure would just bite me.
Our GCC does the same thing. Only instantly, they are such a lovable breed
I'm going to need to be linked to the dog videos... ya know, for uh, science
I miss my conure :(
Ahi
 🐘
Well..that was the cutest. Now I want a bird.
I want
"Here, let me help you with that!  This is how we do the pets."  \*Snuggle\*
I love these because a lot of times the animal is like "Looks like you're having trouble with the pets. Here I'll help you hooman."
If my hand is hanging a little bit off the arm of the chair, my dog puts her head under it.
My bird would have ripped three chunks out of me before I’d get anywhere near it’s head.
That's adorable
thought it was originally on /r/BlackPeopleTwitter
"Yes, go on patting me. U do not stop until I say so, human."
Fine, you win, its adorable. Take my upvote.
Such a green cheek thing to do! Ours does this too! Can’t resist the cuddle cape
awwww

Why in the world are these called challenges? Video is cute af and all, but challenge?
That bird maybe has like a few hertz of processing power, that explains the 10 sec gap
Fluffff
Bird is the word. They heard about it on a tweet. Humans be damned with stupid challenges.
Cute drone 🥰
"Fine. I'll do it myself."
My heart can't take this, that's a lot of sweetness
that is a challenge? that's not really a challenge tbh
Fine, i’ll do it myself.
My dog woulddothat
Does anyone have the actual name of the bird and/or owner?
"Fine, I'll do it myself."
Auto pet!
Maybe I’m just hungry but their blanket looks like salmon sashimi.
"Permission to pet."

"Mmmmmm...  yes." 😊
I'm just focused on the salmon couch
Distracted by the couch that looks like salmon
Very patient birb!

What kind of bird is this
Awwwwwwww
Conures are the best! They really do have their own little personality. My conure used to hate feet so much I never understood why, but they would literally climb down from their perch to bite those exposed toes. He also used to scream  and fly to me whenever he heard me come home to get my attention and would always want to eat whatever I was having. Best bird I ever had. (:
That puff up at the end is precious! Lil bird is so proud of having achieved cuddle success :)
This is the cutest thing ever wtf
That is the best thing I've seen all week :)
My bird would fuckin bite my thumb off if I tried that
I will take by myself
Ha I'll do on my own
How is that a challenge?
your Beautiful sweet loving monogamous mate knows what to do and forgives you , you silly human ;o)
What kind of bird is this?
These are the types of challenges I can get behind. This is much better than the tide pod challenge.
I cannot like this enough.
So cute,  My favorite .....
Awww🥺
Little watermelon you!😍
The word challenge has lost all meaning
The way he puffs his little chest is just ❤️
I love when my cats do this
“Challenge”
Now I want bird
It's like, unknown action, computing computing computing...ding, step backwards.
“Fine, I’ll do it myself”
Aww, this is the most adorable thing I have seen in a while
A “challenge,” huh?
Wow I love this bird
Need one ... what kind ?
Awww! That melted my heart!
That is so beautiful.
I love how patient the bird was.

Like "whenever you're ready human". So cute
Alright, that was adorable af
Bird went, mmm cozyyy
Nature finds a way.
This melts my heart
So sweet 🥰🥰🥰🥰

Bird get pats
That chair though
birds are cute but it makes me sad that they are kept as pets. Can someone inform me if they're actually happy living in a cage?
Ahhh worth the wait
That... made me smile
My chinchilla doesn’t like pets, but he likes to smooch into my hand/arms/legs all the time when he’s eating. 
Just doesn’t like movement while enjoying his food.
Omg. So sweet!!!

Those eye. His body freezing as he checks his whole environment double checking the hand above him. So sweet
People have killed the word challenge. That’s not a challenge, that’s just weird.
He really said “here let me help you”
Ohhh its an angapornis. i had one, but holy hell do they poop a lot.
i wish a giant hand could pet me too
It’s weird to put your pet through that



Edit: like why are people testing their pets love
Super cute 😍
r/birb
We don't deserve animals
Wholesome af 🥰
Have the same bird... it would do the same thing, but sooner and with more biting
It took a while but was worth it
The bird who owns us would have inflicted a savage beaking if he had to wait that long for a snuggle.

Okay, tbh we'd get the savage beaking regardless, but the cuddle helps.
Birb
Whenever I put my hand on the ground near my Tuxedo Cat, Mister "Jolly Mon" Mistoffelees, he will rub his head against my hand as if I have suddenly developed amnesia and forgotten how to pet him.
Ohhh my heart..
Always go 90, let them come 10.
Awwww I think we humans do this too while looking to be spooned!!!
Awwww
What a challenge
I came for a heart warm, i left with a heart warm

Thank you
I do that with my cat, I bleed.
Any bird person here want to explain to me why my 2 budgies want nothing to do with me unless I have food? :’(
Pird. Burred. Did bird purr?
Is this really a challenge now? I've been doing this with all my pets for most of my life. It's the most fun with my grandma's cat because he will start standing up if you keep pulling your hand up from his head
Awwww 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
This is consent testing!  In the shelter/animal behavior world we strongly suggest doing this to help build a relationship, especially with fearful animals! This is so sweet!
I want to have a bird someday
I’ve had my hand next to my asshole cat for an hour and I’m starting to cramp up.
"Challenge".
Take my free award
I tried this on my roommates parrot and he bit the everloving shit out of my hand.
This isn't reversed?
He embodied the "fine, I'll do it myself" quote
Now this, this does put a smile on my face...
That’s a beautiful mango they got there
The dramatic pause and stare really gets me... "Are you.... are you going to?"
Poor creature
“well if u aren’t gonna pet me ill pet myself”
Challenge.... umm, what?
Oh my cold dead heart!
Holy shit dude. That was the cutest thing I've ever seen all day. Thank you so much!
This is the part where you pet.

That bird was like “fine, I’ll do it myself!”
I’ve only ever seen this amount of awards once before...
That is so sweet! ❤️💚💛
Awwww so cute
What a cute little mango.
My guy does this all the time...even when I’m not offering my hand. Lol
Aww, my conure does this too, let me try to get a video.
My friend sent this to me yesterday so I tried it on my bird. He just looked at me, nibbled on my fingers then got shy and started grooming himself.
What a patient bird
That moment when you saw this video on tik tok And didn’t post it to reddit and now it has over 100k and over a thousand awards 😂😂
Can someone explain this use of 'challenge'? I don't get it.  Nothing in these kind of viral videos are difficult or take skill or talent.  It's a meme, not a challenge.
Like a first date... *someone* has to make the first move.
How do you resist after that... you don’t.
My dogs run up and rub their heads against my hand so I don’t think I can do this one.
This gave me such anxiety. JUST PET HIM! 😂
You go 90, she goes the last 10
I tried it with my bunnies, not the result i expected https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/is2i44/i_tried_the_challenge_where_you_put_a_hand_over/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
why is it on a giraffe?
Ah the latest software update has included the “bond with target” subroutine, and probably a “extract bio info from scritches” subroutine as well. Oops wrong sub, but seriously that is outrageously adorable.
What’s the challenge though? Oh right just another stupid trend
My bird just bites me if I don’t give him treats 💀
Why is everything called a "challenge" nowadays tho 🤔
My heart is bursting gawd
My dog would just attack my hand.
Guess I'm buying a bird
BIRD: Wait that's illegal...
My dog moves his head to my hand. He's getting so many pets when I get home.
❤️❤️❤️
I wish my birds loved me. They are filled only with rage. I still love them though!
Is flower furniture a requirement to own a bird?
‘You’re really gonna make me move?’

‘You lame excuse of a servant, FINE, gimme the pets!’
I’m gonna try that on my turtle
The closed eye is what really puts it over the top.  That look of “yeah thats the stuff i wanted”
If I did this to my budgie I’d get bitten
If that's a female, doing that too much might get you an egg.

I just tried this with my dog.

She leaned backwards and gave me a high five.
Thats a heckin smart bird. If the hand don't come to bird, then bird go to hand.
"Fine, I guess I'll do it myself then."
I tried it this with out pet snake. Turns out our snake (5 year old Spotted Python) don't want to be petted. She bit me.
Too cute.
Why is everything a "challenge" when it's not challenging lol. I've always done this to annoy my cats
What a sweet little bird! 🥰
If you have a cat, that's not a challenge, that's just how you pet them sometimes
So cute ❤️❤️
Wow, so unbelievably cute 😍
Seems like kind of a mean 'challenge', but I suppose if the animal wants to be petted enough they'll just do what this little bird did.

My cat is like that, I often times can't actually move my hand all the way to her head myself before she's already rubbing up against it with basically her entire body weight.
Here's a dumb I don't know anything about birds question. Why do they blink?
Are u gonna pet me or what
I held my breath unintentionally until the bird was pet
Here!! Take my updoot
Oh my heart 🥺
Fine , I'll do it myself
Very adorableness. Love it.
Omg he puffs up!
Bruh pet it already. its waiting
This actually elicited an "awwww" from me.

My heart melted... Now I'm about to die. Thanks...
When, and if I retire, and god forbid I lose my partner, I would adopt a bird as a companion. I have a few friends who have adopted and or fostered and these are amazingly loyal, loving beings. And please adopt.
This has as many comments as it has awards🤯
this is so cute!
This is me after arguing with the fiancé and think that I'm stupid and lucky to be loved
