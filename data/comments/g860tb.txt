Loved how he sat up when he heard your name and was genuinely excited and proud when he saw you.
Is this Spokane? Thought I heard something about the Garland Theater. Wasn't expecting to see my city on here, haha.
This made my heart happy
Man this guys looks like such a dad... the world needs more dad dads
Where's the trivia? Monday what time? I'll be there (online), if you tell us where.
This is the kind of wholesome we need
This reminded me of my dad. I lost him when I was 27 and today at 32 is the first time I really really really miss him. Hug your dads, folks.
There‚Äôs no better feeling as a parent than to watch your kid killin it. It‚Äôs awesome. Your dad is SUPER proud of you (and your mom is, too)!
I want more stuff like this on this sub. Don't get me wrong I love animals but seeing wholesome reactions like this are really heartwarming.
Your dad is adorable 

Also orange fur-babies!! That floofy tail!
What for ?

Edit: ok that is an amazing feat you have done
Um, cats are extra
Even your kitty was excited to hear your name üòª
I think i love your dad, can he adopt me?
That's real happiness üôÇ
Duuuude, the way his head just pops up when he hears a name he knows too well. I can't!
That‚Äôs a proud Papa bear right there.
I love how much your dad loves you!! Those little victory punches. My heart. Aaaahhhhh
Even the cat is proud.
I really wish I can one day experience the joy this man is feeling. The pride and joy is probably worth the countless years of hard work and suffering it is to bring a human into this world.
Your pops is awesome!! All the love!
Your dad is adorable, and you sound like an awesome person. He's clearly so proud of you.
Love the cats lying around in a coma üòÅ
As a father of daughters, I totally understand this feeling. It made me tear up watching this. What  a beautiful thing. :)
Awesome.  I hope your dad is there to enjoy your accomplishments for years to come.
Awww. That‚Äôs sweet.
So sweet. He's so proud!! Also yay for being on the news!! That's so cool!
I went back a few times and watched the double take he did when he heard your name.  So funny.  The cat also woke up when he leaned forward.

This is so uplifting
I like your pops get him to lose a few lbs so he can stick around longer.
Dude, you gotta love how he goes from: ‚ÄúThis‚Äôs...really boring,‚Äù to: ‚ÄúWait, ‚Äòs that mah daughter?! News just got very interesting.‚Äù
Trivia question - Who's proud of this daughter?

Answer - THIS GUY!

So cute.
how tall is he?
Worlds best hype man
Cat tax please
The way he just lit up when your name was mentioned ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hey, I grew up in Garland! Texas right? Downtown Garland theater! Good to see someone doing great things there.
Shit, all these posts I see like this make  me happy that there are great parents out there. I don‚Äôt get to have experienced like this. My parents were cold and uncaring. Power and control is everything to them. Dad definitely has a personality disorder. 

I love seeing parents like this and try really hard to emulate this my 2 kids. My wife and father/mother in law are such great examples as well.
Oh my God, I love him.
The cat is just chilling on the couch
Dad-daughter relationships are so special, I love you watching my husband be a girl dad!
This was so cute.  What a good dad.
Dads can be real awesome sometimes. When I was struggling to finish my last semester at university, my mom told me how my dad would call her from work and start talking about how proud he was of me. I tell ya I‚Äôd be way worse off in life if it weren‚Äôt for his constant faith in me since I was just a kid
I like your chill cats.
Hell yeah, buddy of mine who MC‚Äôd my favorite college trivia game (which since leaving the state I haven‚Äôt been able to be a apart of) has begun Zooming trivia (off the books from his backing company) and it has made this whole covid thing a million times better. So that‚Äôs exciting to hear you doing the same thing, and definitely so nice to see your dad proud of you!
"That's my girl"

Weird right as he said that someone started chopping onions near me
"Thats my girl" - best compliment a parent can give
Yo man, this video made me happy too, but tell Dad he's gotta lose some of that extra dad. :(
I don't mean that in a mean way, but that shit kills man.
Much love
[removed]
[deleted]
Give that man a hug
It is always great to see your children succeeding at what they love!!!  I wish your next trivia night to be fun and profitable. :)
This is awesome.
Despite the parental bias, you sounded good!
If u don‚Äôt mind me asking what we‚Äôre you on the news for?
Shut up, you're crying
That made me so happy. My dads passed and I love seeing moments like this. ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you.
This would also be good to post on r/mademesmile
10/10 dad reaction

"that's my boy/girl" is maybe the best thing a human being can hear about themselves
Don't take this wrong, but I love your dad.
I love wholesome black dads SOOO much
‚ÄòThat‚Äôs my girl. Ha Haaaa!‚Äô This is perfect.
I love this so much. Just unconditional excitement.
So sweet! ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs My Girl!‚Äù Being lived is the greatest miracle.
Passively listening to news.

Hears daughters name

**Actively listening to news**
Staying away from father..
One day just want my father to be this proud/happy for me.
That‚Äôs one proud papa.  Verklempt.
[removed]
I know you might not read this, but I hope you do. 

Cherish that man. 

There‚Äôs so much pride in his eyes and his actions. I can guarantee there‚Äôs nothing more in this world he loves than his child / children. 

You can‚Äôt fake emotions like that. 

He‚Äôs so damn proud of you, it‚Äôs crazy heartwarming to watch.
Diabetes though,  right? :(
Lot of asshole keyboard cowards commenting in this one.
[removed]
They chill with their humans, and your dad looks like a good dadüòÄ
Proud papa
Your dad loves you so much üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è

I like how even the cat is excited and turns to watch
Sounds like he did a great job raising you and is proud of the things you do and to be your dad !
This warmed my heart. Thank you
Pure love ‚ù§‚úåüòÅ
That's a proud dad :)
This just made me feel good inside
Even the cat is suprised
Proud papa!
Even the cat reacts!
Love seeing black dads! Keep making him proud sis. ‚ù§
Bruh even the cat looked up.
Washingtonian here too! He looks like a wonderfully proud Dad!!
His joy is really infectious
Your dad reminds me so much of my dad. Big cute sweetheart that's proud of his kids. This made my heart happy and we're so lucky to have them
Hey, I love your dad.
CAT
That's a nice dad.
Proud papa!!! Love it!
He went from "I'm not sleeping" to spit-take in a second! Very nice.
So many happy tears. This is a beautiful thing
The link to the news
https://youtu.be/VbUuB1aN2DA
That‚Äôs so precious. He looks so proud of you. Hope you and your family are safe, OP!
YEET!! +1000 for making pops happy.
That cat knows the deal too. Its ear flicked the moment she talked.
Anyone also noticed the cat also perked up once the reporter said her name?
The punches tho
As someone who lost her father to cancer 10 years ago and lost her mother to cancer 3 months ago.
Really brings a year to my eye, I won't have a reaction from anyone like that for any future major achievements.

Thank you for capturing this precious moment. I wish you many more moments to make your parents proud.
When I saw the title, I really wanted to hear 'That's my girl!'

Was not disappointed, thanks for sharing. ‚ù§Ô∏è
News "And suspect is still at large..."
Dad "Ye ye ye yeah!"
Damn. Wish I had a dad so he could be proud of me like that.
What a lovely guy. But to be honest, he's seriously overweight and I worried about his life
That moment when he hears your name has some serious meme potential
I love this so much I actually cried. Being a parent does weird things to your heart. Thank you for posting!!!
I love this so much.  
Truly precious.
Time to sort by controversial. I'm grabbin' the popcorn.
Sweet
Right in the good feels.
*happy dad noises* <3
*parental love intensifies*
Thank you for the smile I had :)
Cat: meh, I've done better.
Omg he's amazing
I love this so much ‚ù§Ô∏è and that happy dance!!
Damn I think I've waited my whole life to see my dad have that kind of support and pride in something I've done, definitely something to be appreciated and remembered.
Cat not caring is very on brand
He seems like the sweetest
That fist pump, he's real proud of you ‚ô°
Such a proud Dad!
This is very precious. Thank you for sharing!
I hope I can make my dad this proud when he comes back from buying cigarettes.
Garland, Texas?
I love you dad!
A proud father.....can‚Äôt relate
This is so awesome! What a great family!
He did that Halo position shift
On the news for what
Girl, i don‚Äôt know who you are but your voice sounds exactly like mine. It. Is. Trippy.
Kitties! Adorable dad! This video has it all!
I'm also loving the cat who does not give a damn.
That‚Äôs so sweet thanks for sharing. I was really angry earlier and this made me realize how things like this are what‚Äôs important. Hope that makes sense.
Omg I love that they have two ginger cats üêà
That is so cute and awesome!!
This makes me happy
He was beaming. So cool.
:)
Just curious, but why were you on tv?
I can make out what you say but apparently not enough
Oh my god that is so touching lol, your dad had a face of pure happiness and pride!! Thats my girl! :)
I think all dads own Russel T-shirts
Your Dad is the kind of father mine was. He's been gone almost 20yrs, but this reminds me of how proud he was of our accomplishments. Cheers to y'all, and best of luck with your trivia!
You have to watch it with sound. When he goes, "My girl!" the tears jumped out of my eyeballs.
My video froze the first time I watched it but audio played. It honestly looked like he stonecold didn't even blink when he heard her name/face. I couldn't help it, I just laughed so hard. 
Then I rewatched it with working video, and I felt the feels. 
What an emotional rollercoaster guys.
Its the little things that get us dads hyped AF.
r/mademesmile
The Bon Bon! I was hoping to possibly go your trivia nights before this happened! Absolutely love the Garland!
Your dad is adorable. He dads really well.
So good, dude. Wow ... I needed to see this more then I thought. Thank you, I'd award you if I could man... Just know from an unknown who doesn't matter much, this meant alot to me seeing your dad like that. I don't even know why.
Heck yah trivia! What a proud dad :)
Can you link me that couch. It looks amazing
You live in WA? I heard Inslee. Haha I am in Lakewood
Did you smuggled drugs
Cute yellow kit cat too
I watched this 4x in a row, despite not knowing you, and was so transfixed, so proud of you, so touched & so teary. The way your dad popped up, said, "My girl!" and pumped his fists with excitement...ugh, my heart....Thank you for sharing.
I felt this. The day I had my first small interview for this food show they love to watch they recorded it and re watched my part quite a bit. All my family freaked out about it and were so proud of me
This warms my heart in such an indescribable way. This is so wholesome. You are so lucky to have such a loving and proud father. I love that this moment was captured with all of m heart. I could watch this for hours. There is so much joy and love captured, and the world needs more moments like this. More relationships like this. Make fathers like this. How lovely.
Even the cat started watching
When you see true joy and happiness, makes you feel good too!
My heart ‚ô•Ô∏è
I love this so much you have no idea, wait, you probably do lol. God bless
It‚Äôs the most selfless thing ever. Just to know you made it. That‚Äôs all he really cares about. What a solid family.
AWWW SO WHOLESOME! What a sweet relationship you all must have! ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks for sharing!
Gonna need you to give your dad a hug when you can. His pride and excitement are so wonderful!
This made my day, thank you.
This is so cute!
Damn, how tall is your dad? He looks like 7 ft tall sitting down
That's cute. Also the sleeping kitty.
This is gosh dang adorable. 

Also, I love the ironwork thingy on the wall above your dad's head and I'd love to know where he got it.
Is this what it's like having a father who's proud of you? This is adorable :')
Tell your dad I like his cats.
Bob Sapp needs to get back to fighting cans
I love the two kitties too
THATS OUR GIRL NOW üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üëåüèø
Cat didn't even flinch.
I do not know this man. I would die for this man
The little pops of ginger cat around makes this extra cute
I like this guy.
Made me smile so much.
What a wonderful man. This made my day.
Fuck Onions.
This makes my heart happy. Genuine.
That's so fucking sweet. All the love and health to your dad.
this makes my heart so happy
im saying this as a white teen, but god damn black people know how to have fun and when to be happy, they are so fun to hang out with some times, and as a guy who doesn't really go to church, i like how the African American community make going to church WAY more fun and engaging.
This Is So Cool! That He Like, WHAAAT? and then the momment of proud., i remember when i was on news first time  Because i handeled a guy who was just running thru my city and hitting people and kids, i stopped him and news asked me for an interview after that, after the incident so many people just said thanks to me because they where afraid if they kids where to meet that guy what would hapen and that nobody but me stopped him..
Spokane ?
Hey man that‚Äôs ok üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è
Omg I love your dad that is adorable!
That couch looks comfortable af
I wish my mom felt this way about me
Man this is LOVE ! Amazing CONGRATULATIONS üéä What a beautiful family!! 

I‚Äôm going to sound salty but I was on the news and even got to do an interview with Telemundo in Spanish. Showed my dad and filmed reaction. He said ‚ÄúChevere‚Äù basically ‚ÄúCool‚Äù. I was shocked like wow dad. Really? That‚Äôs it. 

Anyways I wouldn‚Äôt wish my dad‚Äôs reaction on anyone. This is really awesome your dad  is genuinely so proud of you ‚ù§Ô∏è
I got the same walker while I recover from Achilles surgery!
Aww! That's the best. I miss my dad now... Give yours a big hug next time you can.
This is adorable
such a proud papa<3
Happy tears üò≠üò≠üò≠
That's the first natural smile I've experienced in days, I'm pretty sure ‚ò∫
He seems like a great father!
Nothing gets me choked up more than proud parents :‚Äô)
My camera froze, so for a time I thought this was a picture of him having no reaction whatsoever
He is so proud! Your dad is just the sweetest. This video gave me so much joy. I wish my parents were more like yours.
I miss my dad.
Greetings from Pullman since I heard this was in Spokane!
Your dad is proud af!
I was just thinking about how down I am that my dad doesn‚Äôt get to see my new apartment (no roommates!) or my new promotion and how great I‚Äôm doing at work. He took his own life 7 months ago and it‚Äôs hard not getting to share these accomplishments. But seeing this video, reminded me of exactly what my dad would‚Äôve done. Thank you :) and good job!!
A dad chilling with his cat on a sofa while watching his kid live on the TV. What more could any of human beings want?
what were you in the news for, if you don't mind me asking?
Actually put a smile on my face üòÑ
I hate being judgemental
I remember the time we were put in newspaper about not wanting to demolish field we used to play football(soccer) for parking. 

I was about 7. It was very little article about this, but damn seeing picture of yourself in newspaper hyped all of our group up for months!

Now thinking, parents were the ones to first make fuss about it for news to come, but the kids were the ones who got published!!!
That did not make me teary-eyed. It made dust get in my eyes and then my nose started running and I got a hiccup all at the same time.
This is the sweetest
I freaking love this
Ur dad looks like Shaq
My heart- This is so wholesome !
I'm ngl, this made my day <3
Such a sincere reaction.
Off topic: where‚Äôd you get the fixture hanging above the couch? My grandmother had one just like it and I‚Äôd like to get one.
This is what winning looks like
Ohh those fist pumps were so proud and happy! I‚Äôm so glad to have seen this!
I love this! He's so proud!
Happy dad noises!
That is a proud dad.
This made me happy
Can we get a photo of that cat please? I see ginger feets!

Kidding, congratulations!
I'm an icy, cynical asshole and this made me tear up.

Am I the only one who finds this man cute?
Wish he was my father
I couldn‚Äôt turn it up loud enough to hear.  Was his child being interviewed by the news because they are a physician or nurse.
Thank you for sharing this moment.

I wish him the best of luck in getting his weight down soon. <3

Damn, your dad and my dad could be interracial twins
As the father of a 6 month old little girl, I get all the emotions he‚Äôs feeling and my daughter can‚Äôt even sit up consistently yet lol. Fatherhood is an emotional roller coaster that no one could‚Äôve prepared me for.
Your dad seems sweet!

Off topic, but where can I get a couch like that? I would love to have something that tall!
That is so adorable, he is so proud.
actually made me go awww

No offense but it‚Äôs so heartwarming to see how excited he gets for you.
I'm so envious. Congrats, and tell your dad he's awesome.

He reminds me so much of my stepfather. Completely different "colores" yet such similar reactions. Interesting.
Aww hahah, so cute <3
Love the cats too!
Is there such a thing as second-hand pride?
Ahhh thanks for the daily wholesome
The timbre of this woman‚Äôs voice sounds like mine. Interesting.
This is adorable. Thank you!

r/happycryingdads
Everyone talking about the dad but the real MVP of this clip is the mom. She was able to capture this moment on video seemingly without any suspicion.
Animals are cute, but this is the type of shit that makes me actually go "aww"

This stuff is too wholesome!
This is the content the world needs right now. There‚Äôs nothing quite like feeling proud of someone or knowing someone is proud of you.
He‚Äôs so happy like a sport team won how wholesome
This actually made my eyes tear up!
Just the tear jerker I needed
Did he wipe a tear. Omg my heart
True love for real. He got up faster than I do when the delivery guy knocks.
He's so proud ‚ù§
Cat. We need to see the cat.
What were you in TV for? Cute dad, he lives you so much ü•∞
A fathers love is very strong. Unfortunately not always shown because society has told us to be tough and not show emotion. 

My son beat a boss after a week of trying on his tablet game and I hugged him tight and high fived and fist bumped. We love our children very very much.
"my girl!!!!" <3<3<3<3<3
Sitting here being jealous of the cat.. love that your dad is so proud of you!
So happy to see your dad rooting for you like this. Made me happy for you and also made me miss my dad more than usual.
Why were you on news?
Someone clip his reaction and meme it
May I ask why you were on the news?
Even a couple of bonus kitties!
This is so freaking cute!
This.  Lost my dad 8 years ago. Yours is a keeper üíï
So cute. He was proud of you!!
[deleted]
This is so wholesome. I love it
This guy looks like a great man. He looks extremely proud as well. Awesome.
Wholesome
This is so sweet
Your dad looks like a good dude
Your Dad's reaction is wholesome and all...but What's up with that gorgeous cat over there?
That is a proud papa. I love that he sat up as soon as he heard your name. And that proud laugh and cheering gesture is just icing. It make me so happy to see a parent so genuinely proud. I can tell he loves you very much.
Fuck yeah!!!
Holy smokes his face and reaction when he says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my girl‚Äù I love it!!
This is the most wholesome thing, he is so proud of you! I love this!
This is the most emotional I‚Äôve ever been over a random stranger over the internet. Like, I‚Äôm not crying or anything but my voice actually caught in my throat. This is awesome.
Thats so cuteeeeee
Pure pride
Your dad looks like he deserves ALL THE HUGS
Please give him one for me, (if it's medically safe to do so in these crazy infectious times)
That little jingle just emanates pure joy, I'm so happy for you!
This is beautiful.
makes me want to have a kid
Omg! üò≠
The way his face lights up üòä
Everyone loved that.
This is so sweet
Damn he's not even my dad and this made me tear up.
Sat up so fast woke the cat up! Love seeing proud dads!
love the inclusion of kitty paws
I want to cry :‚Äô)
r/happycryingdads
Aww ‚ù§Ô∏è and the cat hehe
I hope to make my father feel this way some day
Even the cat was shook

What I wouldn't fucking give for my father to be proud of me like that.

Jasmine is a really lucky girl and I hope she knows how much her dad loves her.
Awwwww...and he looks like he gives great hugs too.  :)
Then the TV says: "Dangerous serial killer on the run. Lock all doors and stay inside all times until the all clear has been announced."
That cat looks so content

Trivia hosts gonna host. Been hosting my trivia for friends for the past month every Tuesday night. Keep up the good work, it is very much appreciated!
Doing stuff like this is honestly really important in the times we‚Äôre in so I‚Äôm glad the news is reporting on some of the brighter stuff that‚Äôs happening. A group of my friends recently made the news for planning a virtual commencement for our university. It‚Äôs important to stay connected with everything that‚Äôs going on so props to you for doing your part and That‚Äôs a great family moment
You're dad is a cool dude
How many cats do you have.
This was worth spending twenty five minutes of my time looking for cause I accidentally refreshed in popular and searching up mom gave very nsfw subreddits and news just gave the news
Aww, bless him! This made me tear up - I lost my dad almost 7 years ago and I'd like to think this is how he's looking down on me.
Bless that man and that family üôå
the cat reacted as well... lolol
This is the best thing I'm going to see this weekend
He is going to talk about it.
The cat was interested too
You can‚Äôt fake true happiness and love for your kids.

That moment when a father sees all the hope and dreams he's had in his child being fulfilled...
Awww proud dad!
That's so amazing to see. I think we can all hope that our parents root for us like that at some point in our lives. My parents are great and I hope one day I make them perk up like that and do a little jig! They probably did it when I was five, though.
congrats!!! this made my night even more happier

I hope to make my dad this proud someday
