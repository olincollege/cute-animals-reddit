He’d definitely be holding his hat in his paws if he had one.
he looks so polite 🥺
Please sir, can I have some more?
Aww, I had a squirrel in the Bronx named mr plump nuts. Cause he was fat. And liked peanuts. He came around to my balcony so much he got comfy just hand feeding him peanuts on my lap. Then in the spring I noticed he was much thinner and suddenly two or three little squirrels ran up to join him, and I realized it was actually mrs. plump nuts.
“I am politely requesting more nuts.”
I’ve tried so many times to befriend the squirrels in my yard. No luck. Frankie is a special little guy it seems.
“i am once again asking for your financial support”
He do be waitin’ patiently though
They just never forget any spot that they ever find food in
And now you have a squirrel.
[deleted]
My mom did this and then it became a problem. It tried to get into our house and later started bringing its friends.
Ours are named Chauncy. Chauncy 1 through Chauncy 9 and counting.

  Funny thing happens when you start feeding rodents...
<<looks through the cabinets for nuts. finds none. runs to store.>>
I love you Frankie 🥰🥜🌰🐿
is for me?
Can confirm this is what they do. Used to feed a whole horde of them and first thing in the morning when I open my patio blinds there will be one sitting on the patio table with his hands like that. Best way to start the day!
Cute, but as a bird watcher these guys eat all my birdseed!
His sweet little paws and those big eyes... he’s giving you his very best Oliver Twist.
Frankie looks like a fine young fellow😻
That’s a very cute squirrel. I think you know you have to feed him forever now.
Mine do this.

I even had one try to grab at my door knob after I was coming home from an errand. He followed me up to  my door and I could hear little claws scratching at my door. "Where are my treats??"

The other day one came running at me from across the yard, like something was chasing her, because she was so excited to see I was out and she was hungry (she's nursing babies atm).

They're seriously so entertaining. Never gave them a second thought until a neighbor pointed out that she fed them. They're definitely a constant source of amusement haha.
Okay that had got to be the absolute cutest squirrel I have ever seen!
He looks so polite.
Well he looks very polite at least
But OP he is ever so polite ^~^
We have 4 that come to our deck and it costs $20 every two weeks to feed them. Get ready, more will come lol
you are saying "once" but he's waiting for you and you are on first name basis... I call this deliberate misdirection.
I’m with Frankie. We need nuts
https://imgflip.com/i/4yupwe
I can't handle how polite he looks. He's even smiling!
squirrels don’t need to be fed
I tried to feed a squirrel once.

It bit my finger and ran off.
Visited family in Oregon.. They had a back yard of trees tall as the eye could see.. One weekend on the porch reading I had squirrels coming up to me and even a few climbed on my legs and near my head... They didn't run when I turned a page or adjusted myself..  Turns out my family had been feeding them for a few years..  Bruh... These squirrels ate out of my hand and a bowl I set aside... Fucking felt like a 30 year old dude Snow White.
Very relevant 20 min backyard squirrel feeding experiment: https://youtu.be/hFZFjoX2cGg
Please don’t feed wild animals it’s bad for them and it’s bad for us as people.
Years ago we had Freddie and Freida, they'd do the same thing. Freddie would even sit in my lap and eat out of my hand. He even tried coming in the house a couple of times but that cat wasn't have any of that.
Why do people keep feeding wild animals and you people on Reddit constantly upvote it??  It's incredibly dangerous for the animal and dangerous for anyone else that it may demand food from.  This squirrel is likely to get itself killed because it's been trained to eat from humans.  It isn't remotely "cute".  Stop supporting posts like this!
FLUFFY WHITE SQUIRREL TUM AW HOLY GOD
Squirrels suck. They will destroy your property if given the chance, theyre literally just as bad as rats except they have a better pr team due to their tails.  
  
Fuck squirrels, do not feed them.
The offering has begun. Bring forth your sacrifice!
What's your address?  Gunna ship that SOB some nuts! 

P.s. do NOT give your address. Haha
Hes looking really polite so i dont see the problem
"Hooman, I know you're in there...Please can I have some more?!"
Chebstr, you’re not supposed to name it. Once you name it, you start getting attached to it. Now put that thing back where it came from, or so help me!

*(happy cake day!)*
Have no idea why. But this little guy would have an english accent if he could talk.
r/fatsquirrelhate
They are so happy. The posture is lovely and patient.
That is an extra adorable squirrel.
Jeeze the squirrels at my old place were those massive black ones.  I used to feed the chipmunks in my back yard and eventually I had to do it only at specific times or else a squirrel the size of a small cat would brutalize anything else that crawled on my deck.
"Please sir, allow me a moment of your time so I may tell you of our Lord and Savior, you, the God of Nuts. I await whatever nut miracle you may grace me with for the rest of my days, ALL HAIL THE NUT LORD!!!!" - Dapper squirrel of the century.
One day he will stop coming. You have to admit it would make you at least a little sad. He has a little life. Just give Frankie some more nuts!
“I am once again asking you for a small donation of nuts”
I had a squirrel i fed in college i called him Reginald.
It has lnnocent eyes..😘
"With the winter and all sir, well it's just that.. I'd rather be safe than sorry"
\*Insert Bernie Sanders asking for donations meme here\*
he looks very polite
Why do we always name the animals that come into our lives? Me too, I have a Robin mate called Clive
This is one polite squirrel. He deserves a lifetime of free supply of nuts 🥜
That's a terrible idea
https://imgur.com/a/VMpekL5
All I can hear when I see this picture is "please, sir, can I have some more?"
Please don't feed the wildlife. You are doing more harm than good.
Frankie will soon notify his friends of the open buffet, and your yard will be filled with squirrels. I started feeding the birds in my yard, and now 17 squirrels show up everyday to eat the food I put out.
When we lived in Norfolk, VA we had a squirrel that came right up to us when we sat on the porch. We had some pecans from a neighbor's yard so we gave them to it. Every morning after that, he knocked on the screen door with his paws and gave us, "The Look." Yes, we bought him nuts all year long. Easy to get attached to the little fellas. We named him Hammerson Q. Squirrel. When we moved, we left a note for the future tenants and a large bag of nuts.
Hate to break it to you but now you gotta feed this precious baby every day
Yea,cute now. Wait until he's in your house looking for the food you once fed him.
Why are you wasting time taking a picture?! Get Frankie his nuts!
Well, Frankie is adorable.. If i were you I’d be out there building him a permanent residence
He just needs a suit of Victorian clothes to complete the look
I love this! My grandparents had a backyard squirrel named Sheila. The 3 of them loved each other lol.
My apartment must have had a Frankie before I lived there. One day when I got home, I saw a chunk of banana was missing out of our fruit bowl and a chocolate bar had been munched on and dropped on the floor. The only explanation I could come up with was it was our first time getting a dog walker, and they must have brought in other dogs when they came in to get mine, and the dogs went to town on a banana. I was worried about the chocolate so I called the walkers, who were like "yeah we did not bring other dogs in with us." I was like well shit! Ghosts! But it turns out upon closer inspection, a squirrel had eaten a hole in the window screen and made his way in, enjoyed his luxurious banana chocolate snack, and peaced back out the way he came!
👉👈 G-got anymore?
He is very handsome.
I am once again asking for your support
He is so cute. What a pleasant little smile he has. “Please Mrs might I have some more nuts”
He seems very polite, yet hes expecting his nuts and might karen if he doesn't get them.
Make sure those nuts are not salted.
Me waiting for the brownies to cool
We have a squirrel named Socks that comes to us every day or so. He arrived chonk, he will remain chonk.
Squirrels never forget bro I fed a couple of them playing outside my house and now they punctually wait for me to get home from work. Every single day
My fiancées grandma wanted me to feed a squirrel that would come to our yard occasionally because she felt he was hungry. Now this free-loader comes every morning to see if I left him food. I only fed him once and now he comes EVERYDAY.
GIVE HIM NUTS!!!!
Adorable way to ask for food.
Well what you waiting for? Get the man his nuts already!
Someone put a red beanie and a brown sweater on this with some cocaine on its snout, pronto.
My grandma and I had two squirrels in the backyard called Frit and Frat- Frankie has Frit energy.
Precious little being
What a cutie
He like the nut
Frankie says relax
“Will you spare some nuts, sir?”
He’s asking so politely tho’.
That is the most polite looking squirrel, I just **know** he'd say please & thank you if he could
Oh, give him some nuts.
He should get nuts every day for being so well mannered and waiting  patiently.
In his defence, look at him! He’s asking for nuts, although free, so politely. Give it to him and send us a video/pic.
A very polite gentleman he is
"Um excuse me hooman, may I...have some nuts to munch?"
A nervous fella, having just knocked, waits for his prom date to answer the door
That might be the cutest squirrel ever
Aww. I have a squirrel friend too. He runs over to the door anytime he's around and I'm coming in or out the house. His name is Joe Dirt.
I fucking love frankie
Frankie looks so innocent and polite, like “Please sir/ma’am, can I have some more?”
He’s trying to reach you about your cars extended warranty
So cute!!!!!!
He looks very polite.
Well, congratulations on your new squirrel ownership!
Yeah, there is just no way i could resist feeding him if he were at my window... and BAM before you know it, a place at the dinner table is set, and a call each night out the back, *"FRANNNNKIIIIIIIIIE! DINNER'S READY!"*
My grandpa used to squirrel hunt. I never understood why. Look at his cute little hands
We fed a squirrel in our first house.  Unfortunately he decided that was an open invitation to move into the roof, which wasn’t what we had in mind.
Yo he's the cutest little thing, well mannered awaiting for master to provide nuts
“Please, sir, I want some more.”
Give him alllll the nuts
Oh look at his hands!! He needs some Sander’s mittens!
That is a really beautiful squirrel.
“Please sir, can I have some more?”
The man next door used to put jam out every evening, eventually he had hundreds of rainbow lorikeets flocking there everyday at the same time it was so beautiful. He passed away though, and the birds kept coming back for almost a year and dead birds kept being found in his yard and around our street, I guess they get dependent on their new food source.
You have a lovely garden, no wonder squirrels hang out there. We have a grumpy cat that sits in the bushes and swipes at my ankles.
YOU GIVE HIM SNACKS RIGHT THE FUCK NOW
I love their little nipple rubbing stance
He's cool. I like him.
You are doomed! Birds will catch on, babies will be had, other squirrels will be curious next thing you know you will have 6 squirrels, several flocks of birds and raccoons begging at your door!

Not that I know anything about these things, I'm just guessing.....

Fyi, Costco has the best buy for unsalted peanuts, again not like I know of these things I'm just guessing lmao
Okay, well I just fucking love him
He's smiling!
So polite 🥰
He looks very polite.
Awww precious bebe
“Please sir, can I have some more?”
Quick studies, they are.
(Tapping on glass)  ummm...  guys.....remember me?  Any spare nuts?
Is for me? 🥺👉👈
He looks so polite
That is a very nice squirrel.
Spare a nut in this trying time?
I fed a chipmunk that lived under the sidewalk by my glass sunroom. I planted vegetables in the flower bed around the sunroom, and the chipmunk started eating my vegetables. 

So I researched what chipmunks should eat and left him a pile of vegetable scraps from my kitchen and some raw sunflower seeds in the shell from the wild bird supply store. I named the chipmunk Claude, and he left all my vegetables alone. He also exercised my cats.

Little stinker would be on the outside of the sunroom and taunt my cats who were sleeping in the afternoon sun. It was like he'd knock on the glass and stick his tongue out because the cats would suddenly go from lazily watching him with one eye open to chasing him the length of the sunroom, back and forth, back and forth. It was so funny. Unfortunately this was in the mid 2000s, and I didn't have a way to videotape them. They'd do the chase every afternoon. 

The cats were inside only, and I wouldn't let them in the sunroom if I was going to open the outside door so they didn't escape and try to eat Claude. Then we moved. I'm sure Claude had a big stash of sunflower seeds and I left the vegetable plants. There was also an apple tree in the back yard, so I think he was ok. I do wish I had photos, but he was so small and blended in with the mulch.
Yeah, once you feed them they lose their natural fear of man and now they associate you with food. And Now Frankie will Always come to your backyard looking for some nuts. 🥜 PAUSE 🤨
 “A squirrel is just a rat with a cuter outfit” ~ *Carrie Bradshaw* Sex & the City 

Damn cute squirrel though!!!! ❤️
Excuse me sir, do you have a few minutes to hear about our lord and savior - The Great Acorn ?
He has a real name given at birth by his parents you know, you can’t change that to frankie, he is part of a community and has self-respect
Please sir, may I have some more.. nuts?
My god, if I don’t make this exact face when someone is cooking something I like....
That's not Frankie! Run!
We have back yard squirrels and one of them got their tail run over his name is kacheb
Frankie looks very well mannered, if that makes a difference. ♥️
🐿️🥺👉🏾👈🏾
I hate to use emojis but 👉👈 uwu
We fed a squirrel once.  Every morning after that for a couple weeks he'd jump up on the patio table and take a piss.
He looks like a polite squirrel
So cute!
If you don’t feed them they get mad and poop on your door stoop.
This squirrel looks like me standing at Subway while I wait in front of the toppings for my sandwich to finish toasting.
"Please, sir, may I have some more?"
Welp you did it now give that adorable rodent a nut
Please, madam.
He looks so polite, give him his nuts
He's so adorable! Please keep taking care of him. The amount of stress he can take away from you will actually extend your life.
So precious.  His little hands.
SoooOOOOOooooooOOoOoooo cute!!!!!!!
I caught you knocking at my cellar door
I started feeding my squirrel. She would come knock on the glass in the morning, demanding food. She got a lil testy when I ran out of food and gave me a mean look. Sometimes she would try to run inside my place if I cracked the window open. She always was curious and thought my place was a food heaven. But as another Redditer poitned out, they did the same, and the Squirrel came in, shit everywhere, screamed, and ran out the window. So I never let Sandy Squirrel in. 

Then, she found a way into our attic and started crawling around up there and pooping and such so I had to evict her and stop feeding her. 

Please be careful what you wish for, they are there for the food and will find a hole to get into your house.
He’s cute like please 🥺can I haves more
I used to feed my backyard squirrels until they started showing up with more cat scratches and in lower numbers. I was upsetting the balance.
I have a pet squirrel, rescued him
We have the exact same situation. Funny that you named your squirrel also. Ours is Fat Tony.
Look how his little paw-hands are tucked into his belly. So cute!!
Please feed that good boi or girl the best nuts and seed
Wait until he chews a hole in the side of your house and his friends move into your attic.
I’d set up a Barbie dream house or castle grey skull with little squirrel beds for Frankie and his family.
He looks like he's quite sorry to be bothering you.
There’s a raccoon named Steve who lives under my porch. I don’t feed him, he gets plenty from the yard, but at night in the summer time I’ll be out back on the porch and Steve will come porch sit with me. Cool guy.
He is very hopeful. Grinding it out for winter supplies can be exhausting.
Only ONCE? you are monsters!
He looks very polite
I request N U T
He looks very polite.
happy cake day
Happy cake day.
Give him more nuts! He's too cute!
He's a cutie.  ;)  We used to go to Sams and buy the giant plastic tub of peanuts just to feed the squirrels
FEED HIM ALL THE NUTS
FEED HIM ALL THE NUTS
My mom and I have always called every squirrel we see Fred. I like Frankie too.
FEED HIM MORE
See, this is why in the UK the public will never allow the culling of the grey squirrel, even though they are an invasive species here - they are too fucking cute!
Squirrels get attached very easily. Be careful if you decide not to feed Frankie anymore, he’ll probably have trouble adjusting again if you go cold turkey. I’ve had probably 30 squirrels over the course of my life (I’m 21) and whenever I think they might be getting too reliable on our birdseed/hand fed nuts I reacclimatize them. Just in case we go out of town or something. Have fun, and be wary! Squirrels are fun little creatures to have around if you can play them correctly.
Just be careful so that you don't feed him too much!
don’t feed the wildlife dipshit
Oh you have a friend for life !!
haha Frankie Peanuts!
Give him more and accept your fate.
He is adorable!
You obviously don't have a German Shepherd for protection!
Looks like the squirrel version of Jehova's Witness comming to ask if you "Heard the Good News"...
Cute and polite.
He looks very polite.
He looks so polite waiting for another snack though!
I am once again asking for your nutritional support.
He's smiling
man, don't ask what my "drownin' bucket" is for
So squishy
Frankie says ~~relax~~ WHERE’S THE FOOD
Now you have to keep feeding it.
Very polite
They are trainable
You have got to watch Mark Roper's video about challenging the squirrels in his yard!
He looks so polite!! 🥺🥺
I need some more!!!
LOOK AT HIM WAITING LIKE A GOOD GENTLEMAN
They always come back.
A good boy !!
He looks very polite! Squirrels love walnuts btw
Frankie needs a tweed vest.
I like free food, too!
Make him a picnic table
How is work in the lunch room, Frankie?
Ours stand on the top of the wall with their hands on their hips
Those EARS ❤️
Mein bruder had a squirrel outside named buddy
Has he told his friends?
I swear the feed of this sub should be implemented into therapy sessions.
Frankie enjoying Deez Nuts
Not to be dramatic but I would die for Frankie
Phat Gus in the making.
"Excuse me sir, do you have time to talk about nuts. Also, any donations would be much appreciated."
I have 2 in my backyard that eat out of my hand. They are the sweetest. They have actually started trying to come inside my house when I open the door. Lol oops
Frankie is precious
Probably a mooch.
FEED BABY!
Hope you feed him twice.
Very well mannered.
Ummm, give him more nuts.  Don't be mean.
H--Hammy is that you?
I realized I was wasting apple cores by throwing them out. Every day I slice up one or two apples for breakfast and leave the cores wedged in the branches of a tree on my patio. The squirrels never fail to claim their prizes.
I have a squirrel that lives in the tree outside my patio. I got lazy and left food out, which it found, and now it keeps going on my table to find any food. It tried twice today and I shooed it off. Once I sprayed it with a squirt bottle. Does anyone know how to get it to stop? Will it get the message if I shoo it off the table? No longer leaving food there.

I'm not allowed to feed the squirrels here so I could get in trouble.

edit: me and the squirrel are homies otherwise. it chills eating pine cones and nuts next to me all day normally.
he patiently waits w his politely tucked peets
C H O N K
Frankie is a gentleman.
That is a cartoonishly perfect picture of him
At an old house, we had this gray squirrel who’d lounge on the porch railing and a specific tree branch. You could tell which branch was his because he’d chewed away the bark where he’d take his naps.
Anybody else notice how the squirrels in these threads where they are playin' folks for food ALWAYS  hold their hands the same way as Butters from South Park?
If you are what you eat, is he nuts?
"I am once again asking for your support"
That's literally my gf
Wait till they bite on all ur succulents and leave them everywhere...
I’ve heard of terrorists using squirrels as bombers, be careful out there!
Me and Frankie and 3 AM, Searching for nuts
I'll give em some nuts.
Give that gentleman a tophat!
I love Frankie so much!!!
Cute
Is for me?
Remember when Bob Ross had a squirrel?
Handsome Frankie, so handsome
Well what are you doing on reddit? You got a squirrel to feed, asshole.
We had a couple growing up that we would feed.  The last one that hung around was a female we named Rocky. She made the same "please" look. She would come inside and hop up on the couch if we were not in the room. After she had her babies in don't think she came back much and I don't remember the babies coming around either.
I’ve been trying to befriend my local crows for funzies. I talk to them and throw them peanuts everyday. I now have a very sweet squirrel friend named Stuart. 😊
That’s one hell of a squirrel you got there.
my neighbor(i live in a townhouse) has like 3 birdfeeders and a drinking pond in his backyard. Also has nuts scattered on the floor. His backyard looks like a Disney cartoon with all the animals he feeds.
Looks like a socially anxious dude asking for a donut


I love him.
There's a few backyard squirrels that come and go but there's one that always comes over when I feed the crows. I've named him Mr. Fatsby and he sits like this too when waiting for his turn for a peanut. It's pretty adorable.
Give him anything he wants!! 😭
Don't leave a bro hangin'
Would 100% die for Frankie
SUPER!
We had one like that when I was kid. He was mad chill and learned his name and would run from super far away. He’d also hang out in the garage when we were in there. He’s climb on the screen door if we ignored him.
Ayee bro , I promise if you front me the nuts right now I can pay you back in full during next harvest. I need it broo...
Yeah they put you on the squirrel  list
He looks polite. And pouring on the cute.
Just so you know, they will tell their friends, and if you stop, they get angry.
He wants to says i wanna hold dese nuts
He's just waiting so patiently like a good boy
Welcome to the club.
Don’t you know the fundamental rule? You never fuck with squirrels. 

https://youtu.be/ojZVpb0cVkE
I am once again asking for nuts.
This squirrel is SO cute!!! Must be a little baby!! I would love to befriend a squirrel but in our city I'm they're 2-3x as large and a bit scary... Some of them eat chicken wings from the garbage.
Happy Cake Day!
💕soooo cute
Put your nuts in his mouth you monster
“ please sir, can I some more”
Thoseee tinnny arrrma crossed waiting for food aww
I want it😭😭
Last year I got a bird feeder to put in the window where my indoor cats like to hang out. It quickly became a squirrel feeder. My cats lose their shit every time they come to feed. It’s awesome. The squirrels basically mock them. I started to notice that the squirrels were picking out all of the sunflower seeds and leaving the rest, so I got an all-sunflower bag of feed. I have to top that thing off daily now.
lucky!
OMG THIS HAPPENED TO ME TO! OURS IS NAME JERRY!
Jealous of your squirrel. That is all.
You best give him all the nuts he wants ☺️
Now ask him which way the TALKING LLAMA WENT
How cute 🥰
I have a squirrel too! I started feeding him because he was missing a tail and was being bullied by other neighborhood squirrels and he just decided to hang around and I’m so happy! He brings a smile to my face daily!
Awwww haha adorable!! Give him lots of nuts!!! 🥰🥺☺️
we fed a seagull once and then he came back allmost every day for 4 years before he just stopped coming back :(
Hi Frankie
If you didn’t feed him I will show up to your house....


... to feed him proper
[Maybe teach him to earn his nuts?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hFZFjoX2cGg)
So damn cute!!
Smart little bugger, he knows he can't get Planters mixed nuts from the trees back there🤣
Frankie looks happy
He has such a proper waiting stance. Too cute!
Omg a friend for life
Sooo uhhhh about yesterday?
Isn’t that “more” in sign?
You're Canadian, aren't you.
happy cake day
I’d build him a DIY squirrel vacation house and give him unlimited nuts
Awww I really like Frankie!
Give him more nuts!
This this is why you never give money to panhandlers.
Hi Frankie have a nice day and stay cute and be good all the time!
"H-hey, do you have any more nuts?👉👈"
Squirrels have an encephalization quotient similar to humans, dolphins, and crows. They're cool little guys.
👉👈
Hey! It’s old Frankie Nutz from the backyard
I'm about to order some more sunflower seeds for mine. I put them on the windowsill and then if I'm lucky I spot them eating.
I can haz plz?
I used to love squirrels.

Then one cost me $1,000 in auto repairs.

Now, I hate squirrels.
😍😍
Won't they develop reliance if you feed them too much?
awesome, he's cute..
I feel like the types of squirrels I’m seeing posted on r/aww are soooo much cuter than the ones I’m used to in my neck of the woods (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_squirrel). 

I just want to boop this little guy/gal!
I had a pet squirrel once i still have an old video playing with it. Name was rocky and i'd definitely raise a baby squirrel again
He’s cute and deserves petties if he’ll allow them!
We did this until Charlie our squirrel friend got into our house by chewing through a screen on a window. We stopped feeding them after that.
I can relate after the last 5 years...
Fed the squirrels in my backyard for a month and those creatures still flee at the slightest creak of my patio door. Hard to find squirrels that trusts humans.
this made my day🥺
I dont how god damn cute that thing is its a germ and disease filled creature that are known to be mean and honestly i would close the curtain on him even though hes cute as hell
Imma give that cutie lots o' nuts alright ;)
you have to supply now
Why not take him in to live with you
Can someone please add a hat?
We’ve all decided he needs more nuts.
Please sir, can I have some more?
Now I know where Finland's PM Sanna Marin gets her hand pose from..
Awww
GIVE HIM THE NUTS RIGHT NOW
Please, sir, I want some more.
Looks at his cute little paws and face 😍🥺
He looks very British
Frankie is an excellent name. 

That raccoon who plays and drinks out of our pool at night is named Phil. He's adorable and fat.
There's a new Disney movie about this.
Aww he is so cute
Pls give him nuts and or fruit
Wow, this just reminded me of the squirrel my great-grandparents would feed. They had a yard full of squirrels, but one squirrel in particular would run up to my great grandpa anytime he went out on his porch. Thanks for the flash back OP
But he's so cute! Welcome to the family Frankie 😁
I've been trying to do this too! For weeks I've been leaving out tons of peanuts, bird feed, and basically anything else local critters might like.  Yet every time I try to approach with food they disappear immediately, no matter how slowly I move. How did you get this guy so comfortable with you??
Frankie is adorable & looks incredibly polite. We feed our neighborhood squirrels & some are adorable babies & some we've turned into chubby monsters that bully the other squirrels.
Omg I’m crying
I squealed so loud and immediately added nuts to my grocery list.
I love you Frankie.
((Flash backs to mark rober’s squirrel 🐿 obstacle course))
looks like a frankie
happy cake day
Just install a bird feeder.
Frankie pov give me nuts plz more 😂
Feed him AGAIN
Precious lil thang 🐿️
Give him everything you have.
Don’t do it.
Perfect
He's like "please sir, can I have some more"
"oh please sir, can I have some more nuts"
Happe kaek day!
“Please, sir, I want some more.”
His did you find out his name?
go nuts
I once again ask for your assistance
He's gonna love your nuts.
Frankie looks like a good lad
Hmmm
I used to feed the squirrels where I lived and they got so used to me, they would take peanuts out of my hand. I think they are adorable (most of the time, lol).
Please sir, may I have some more?
I wish we had squirrels in Australia; they're so cute
Got him!
We had a squirrel named nutly, he'd come up to the door and beg. We had peanuts and cheese curls(limited). He once followed a pizza man to his car, pizza man came back up to the door to tell us nutly was following him.
Keep it up and him and his friends will come and extort you daily. When you don’t come off the VIC you will have holes in your screens, the gas lines on your grill chewed through (will need chicken wire wrapped around them from now on) and it  will chew a hole in your wooden shed. Ask me how I know but hey are cute
r/ntbdbiwdfta
Please sir...can I have some more?
I wanna kick him
I will gladly pay you tomorrow for a peanut today.
I am melting omgg
Cute omg
now u got a friend for life.
Good boy 10/10 would give nuts again
Now this truly is aww-worthy
I'm cute and shall feed me!
Same.  We fed squirrels on our porch once so our cat could look at them through the glass door and they come back every day now.
Wouldn’t it be loverly
11/10 would nut again.
I like to feed my wild squirrels the walnut halves. They go crazy for those.
Might be one of the cutest/ sweetest things I have ever seen.
So you gonna feed him or let him stare like that ?? Hahaha
Hey, if he's got good gossip from the neighborhood, keep giving him snacks.
*pets him and gives him a nut* here you go Mr. Frank
give the man more
Happy cake day!
My family used to feed peanuts to the wild deer until our neighbors got upset when Scrub Jays would dump all of the shells in their rain gutters. Since then, several generations of deer have been born in our backyard, and still visit too, or so I hope they are.
DO NOT LET THE SQUIRRELS INTO YOUR ATTIC. Trust me if you do the relationship will turn to hate when he is burrowing holes into your bedroom ceiling.
Awwww! what a polite little baby! 🥺🥺🥺
r/fatsquirrelhate
He is one fine well mannered squirrel. Squirrel mum raised him well.
Is for me? 

🥺👉🏻👈🏻
"Yall got anymore"
He’s nuts for nuts
Optimism. It's good to see this in today's squirrels.
Adorable, but don't feed wild animals. A fed bear is a dead bear. The more comfortable they are with humans, the more likely they are to cause problems for someone and have to be put down
feed him!
A gent's hat would be more fitting.
My brother started feeding a chipmunk that hung out in my parents yard. It would take the food right from his hands.

Then my mom took her car to be serviced... The mechanics cleaned out a HUGE stash of nuts and seeds being kept in a space in the engine haha.
I’ve been working from home and I bought mine a tiny picnic table... he/she will come wait if I haven’t given food... like foot tapping arms crossed waiting 😂
My wife got us into the same situation. Except with a chipmunk. I have to admit, it is very cute
That is ridiculously adorable
Only if my dachshund is like that...
"Pls?"
Awww He looks so patient and relaxed.
Wow the patient he has is amazing
My brother had one that they gave a handful of Apple Jacks to. The squirrel not only continued to return, but took to knocking on their patio door if they pretended to not see him (they were out of Apple Jack's one day) or didn't get there fast enough. It was hilarious.
He looks so polite.
I love this so much! I had a backyard squirrel when I was a kid that I named Chipper. He would eat 🥜out of my hand. Eventually, he brought his whole family over daily for their meal.😁
I have had the pleasure of being with a couple Australians when they saw a squirrel and freaked out. They explained to me that they don’t have them there. Funniest part is they didn’t call them squirrels, they called them squee-rows!
Ngl squirrels are kinda awesome. One time, in the aftermath of a hurricane me and a friend decided to drive around and look at the damages in the neighborhood. We were about to the start the car and heard a scratching noise coming from under the hood - open it up and 4 baby squirrels were chilling under the hood of the car, we don’t know what to do, because we don’t know where they came from, but once we started looking around we saw a larger squirrel watching from the trees, on a whim, we put on some gloves and grabbed the babies, holding them against the tree, one by one the squirrel ran down the tree and grabbed them from us, ever since then was seems to be the same squirrel has become quite friendly with us, running up to us when we’re outside and such
Saw something related to that on the "daily dose of internet" youtube channel but its a video and not a picture.
Please show me your nuts.
**NUTZ**
You messed with squirrels, Morty.
I friggin love him with all my soul. Those polite little folded arms!
SQUIRREL: 

“HURRY up with the food fo’ I be late to work!”

✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨    
✨☁️Dream B.I.G.☁️ ™️ ✨   
✨(BELIEVE IN GOD)       ✨ ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Please mum...I want some more 🥺

They're so cute
Fuk squirrels
Does he write poetry or have super powers?
That’s a good boy!!
r/FeedTheDamnSquirrel
Give a squirrel a nut, and he’ll ask for a glass of milk.
That boy cute as shit
The most polite boy ever
He looks patience. I wish I was that  patience.
please I have never seen anything this cute
happy cake day, friend
That's funny cos that ain't Frankie that's Charlie.
"Ummm hey friends... Can I has some?"
Pleased to meet you, good sir.
His name should be Oliver - “Please sir, I want some more.”
Frank looking famished, he must acquire the A L M O N D S
I have 3 that come up to my front door, one that comes when I say Squirrel, and one that sits in the tree watching for my car when I leave the house, then he comes running.
Phantastic Frankie
Awwww he’s waiting so patiently lol
Well feed him AGAIN!!!!!!!
Aww...you left him hanging?
Sooo cute
We have a couple who come to our house now, on Christmas one unwrapped his  [present](https://youtu.be/w-IgcCR37R4)
It so cute! Love it! 🙂
Politely, I may add. Double nuts.
He looks so polite
Anything hooman tastes better.
I love the fact that tons of people love animals so much. Not every animal is food or tools. All animals are good. All humans that love animals, well, most of them are good.
I’m so jealous.
Looks like Paddington the squirrel. Things are always happening to him. Do you have any fresh marmalade?
I have rabbits that do the same thing because my sister fed them. They bring along their friends/ family everyday around the same time.
In Frankie’s defense, he looks very polite. Plus, why not share with a new friend? :)
Clearly good people worth visiting again 👍
Well, ya gotta 🥺
We did this once....once we stopped feeding them they tore up the windows trying to get inside. Never again
“I’m terribly sorry to bother you again, but I very much enjoyed those last nuts you kindly gave me. Please sir, do you have anymore spare?”
He looks very polite
They enjoy bread too, but be careful carb loading the lil guys.  My aunt had a who clan of squirrels that were choads because she would buy a loaf of bread specifically for them when shopping.
Hes so cute!!!
GIVE HIM SOME FUCKING NUTS!
His voice would sound like piglet from Winnie the Pooh
❤️You are lucky to have this little creature return to you- would love to have squirrels where we live 🐿but unfortunately do not👎
To smart for his own good!!! So damn cute!!!
That John travolta meme comes to mind. “Where the nuts at?”
I don't know why but I'm imagining this squirrel being voiced by James Corden.

"Errrm hello... Hi! I was just wondering if you had any more of those nuts..."
“Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior?”
Nuts, nuts, driving me nuts,
So sicking tired of nuts in me guts,
There's nuts by the bucket,
Sometimes I think fuck it,
I long for a grapefrugt instead of these nuts
- Omnia
Please sir, I want some more.

You should definitely call him Oliver.
👉👈
(PAUSE)
Sir, can I can I have more please?
Oliver Twist (Squirrel)
Same thing happened to me with a cat
I have the exact same situation! This squirrel and their family almost goes into my house whenever I open the door - they’re so excited for food
He seems to be very polite. Or masterminding a scheme...
He looks so polite.
"Please sir, can I have some more nuts?"
Frank da tank

If you don't give Frankie more nuts, he'll eat you instead.
Hello, Frankie.

What a polite young squirrel
Feed him! He is your little friend already! Awwwh.
He’s so cute
Wow! So behaved.
He is so fluffy and cute.

Edit to fix spelling
Adorable, he’s so sweet with those big pleading eyes and little hands. It’s like Oliver, ‘Please Sir, I want more...’
My parents spotted a squirrel in the garden 6 months ago and put some monkey nuts out, Cyril comes back every day now to collect.
He’s coming to get deez nuts
Like my dog waiting for me

Oh my fucking God!!!! So cute!!!
Walnuts and avocados
At least make him work for it. Detail the car or something.
Where's my nuts Summer?
Nervously waiting for his nut
He’s so cute
If it's been colder than usual, they're probably hungrier than usual too.
valuable discipline which can be learnt by this cute.
Try squirrel fishing!

So cute. We have a backyard squirrel as well. They come every few days knocking on our glass window and waiting to get few nuts. We love them. Previous tenant started to feed them
"Please sir, may I trouble you for some nuts?"
Tell him to get a job, no more handouts.
Happy cakeday
Looks like centre parcs 😂😂
A very well groomed squirrel.
Frankie: You started it.
I don´t get it i always leave nuts out for the squirrels in my neigborhood and yet they seem to completely ignore them. I´m always so jealous when i see how colse they come to some people.:(
One time I ran out of nuts and put a few Cheerios out there. I was sitting on the sofa, eating crackers, and I looked over to see a squirrel standing like this at my back slider. He had one little hand against the glass and the other hand was holding a Cheerio. His gaze could have cut glass. I had to close the blinds to escape his scorn. I bought nuts the next day.
Please sir, can I have some more...
Happy cakeday
When I was younger, my parents thought it was a good idea to get a bird house thing that stuck to our patio door so we could see birds up close... only the birds never got to eat the food because a squirrel got there first... then the squirrel found a big enough hole to get into our attic. Drove my parents nuts. Could here it scratching above me at night since I had a bunk bed.
I love squirrels.
Awwww so cute ❤.❤
Please give Frankie some more nuts!
Let’s call him Nutty
Looks like he's standing outside the principal's office lol
Looks very polite.
Your homey is no dummy
Cutest little face and love the paws are folded as a sign of entreaty (also the tint of eagerness).
Such a lovelly comunication
I’ve been feeding the local squirrels for months and I can tell them apart now. I call them Blondie, Notch Ear, Scar Face, Scar Nose, Dirty Nose, and Fatso and they come for dinner most days. They’ll take the peanuts right from my fingers.
holding a flamethrower with a note demanding more nuts or the place gets crispy
It baffles me how people can be cruel to squirrels. I get they’re pests but they are so fun to watch
Aww! I want a backyard squirrel too! But, first I need a backyard.
Bye
Oh ummmm, hi! Excuse me, umm, b-but, 🐿👉👈
Hope springs eternal. He also seems very polite.
He looks very polite hahaa!
"Please Sir, I want some more." 

"MORE?!"
Feed him
Looks like a girl
u/award-cost-bot
His paws are so cute I’m gonna cry
😃😃
Please sir may I have some more?
Jesus H Christ that squirrel is freaking adorable. Feed him all the nuts.
I am once again asking for your nuts
My mom and I decided that all squirrels are named Frank, so I'm glad to see that this apparently applies to other people as well!
Haz you nuts?
I hope you gave him some!
Cute and polite 😍
Cake day buddies
Give him some nuts, he looks so polite waiting.
Please give him treats already 😭😭😭😂😂
Please sir can i have some more?
*UNLIMITED NUTS*
I have great respect for squirrels since I came to know that other squirrel adopt the baby squirrel if it's mother died.
Had a squirrel that got into our apartment once. It was having a great time running around the place until it jumped up onto a still hot stove element. It wasn’t hurt too bad as far as I could tell but it was literally bouncing off the walls as it tried to get the hell out of there. 

Came back a few days later and pulled a Nintendo console off a coffee table onto itself when it tried to climb up the power cord. Never came back after that.
He looks very polite
Next thing you know you're gonna be feeding his whole family ...
I’m once again asking for your nuts.
I can already hear Tony Baker now.....
😍😍😍
We had a little squirrel that lived in the back yard of our tiny little house in an even tinier little village called Nikolaevsk in Alaska.  We fed him once also. Ended up feeding him and several friends the entire year we lived there. I miss them. Kept us entertained.
He's making beggie hands!
Squirrels are unique. 
Saved a baby once. It didn’t work out.

Then found two squirrel babies hurting a year later and rehabilitated them successfully. I was so happy they came back to see me every once in a while.
he prolly love you now.
He's gorgeous!
That's so cute
👉👈
That poor squirrel is just trying to pay back, Squeezel, the nuts he borrowed. He’s in deep with the Central Park squirrel mob.
aaaaaa he looks very polite
He has that "you know I had to do it to em" stance
I thought it was a cat at first glance that just had a reallyyy long neck-
OMG that look! "please Sir, can I have some more?" I'm melting!
We got a Frankie! His name is Barry.
Excuse me Sir, may I have some more... nuts?
we used to feed squirrels and they did exactly this. one time we saw the mum moving the baby squirrels from one tree to another and she stopped midway to get a snack from us which was cute. (she also moved them back a few days later)
Hees eyss alone say it all
I love him, please continue giving him nuts 🙏🏼 🐿️😍

Edited to add: look at his little feet! Omg!!! 😆
  🥺      some legumes please sir?                          
👉👈
👉🏼👈🏼
And Frankie says “ please sir I want some more “
Just LOOK at the little squirrel pawbs!!
He knows his charm has rubbed off on these hoomans
He looks very polite
I’d have named “Friar Frank”. But I’m a weirdo
2 cute
Feed it, it is like praying you for food. Sooo cute!!
We’ve been doing this for a year.  The squirrels are still super skittish and will run away if we are within twenty feet.  The chipmunks, however, are bold af.  They have actually run on my wife's feet and almost gotten into the house.
That's MR Deez Nutz to you.
I live in a third story apartment with a balcony. I had a squirrel who was constantly hanging out on my balcony. One day I shooed him away with a broom. Now he chatters at me from the trees every time I go outside
He's a cutie, very handsome
He looks so very polite. ❤️
Lil bro Frankie

We feed ours often.
Try making him work for the food otherwise he’ll lose his foraging ability
didnt someome do this and end up with a squirrel infestation during winter
When I moved into a new house I had a chipmunk on my front step everyday. I guess the old lady who lived there before me was feeding him.
One time I walked up to a squirrel in a local park. I had no attention to touch it I just wanted a closer look...well then he got defensive and chased me.
I know an addict when I see one. Can’t fool me.
A squirrel is a rat with a good PR office.
Yeah that's what happens with squirrels
Bro he's so polite
Be careful about feeding squirrels on your own yard. They can get aggressive over time because they expect food every time.

When I was a teenager, I decided it would be cool to feed a squirrel on my front yard some oreos daily. Over time, it came closer and closer to me. 

Then one morning while I was asleep, the squirrel aggressively tried to make its way through the front door when my dad was about to take the dogs outside. Fortunately, the dogs scared it away by barking and snapping at it. 

Needless to say, my dad wasn't very happy about it and forbade me from ever feeding any squirrels on our yard.
