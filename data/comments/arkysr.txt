Those are some seriously underhanded methods to achieve good reviews. Bribery!
God I wish that were me 
This happened to me at an AirBnB a few years ago.

 [I woke up seeing this.](https://imgur.com/dCz8Ltx)       
My dog always goes to the Airbnb house on our property first thing in the morning with a ball. 🤣

Edit: thank you for the gold!! If anyone deserves gold it’s Oakley.. She brings joy to everyone she meets. For this gold I shall give her a treat. ❤️🐶

Stayed in an AirBNB once with two cats, they were so cute and friendly and cuddled with us when we were sleeping, etc. 

When we we packing up to leave on the last day I realized that one of the cats had peed in my suitcase.
I don’t understand how the hosts would trust their pets with perfect strangers?! I’m too protective of my pets...
Hi everyone! We are the ones with the air bnb! For those mentioning allergies, it is mentioned when you view our house about the cats (we have 3) so if you are allergic or don't like cats for some reason, you don't have to book with us! We also make sure to mention to anyone who stays here before hand that we have cats just incase they missed it in the listing! :) you also have the option of letting us know if you're okay with having the cats out or we will kindly put them away in our room for your stay! Also for those wondering how we trust our guests, we live in the home as well! When you book with us, you have to have verification so if something happens, air bnb covers our backs! But we trusts our guests :) I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay u/Tan-zania! And we know Oliver is looking forward to your stay here again! ♡
One man's 5 star review is another man's allergic reaction. 
Aw! I love AirBnB cats!
Staying at an airbnb and you don't lock your room while sleeping? That's brave 
Most of the B&Bs Ive stayed at in Ireland had a dog or cat wandering about. Loved making animal friends while traveling!

Omg I love staying at an Irish Bed&Breakfast. We alway had a warm full breakfast from a hovering woman in complete hostess mode, asking about our plans and giving us info while keeping our tea cups full, in her spotless home. :)
That is a superior hospitality professional.
I run a shared Airbnb in England. Most people lock their doors but our last guest from Monday left his bedroom door ajar. He said to me on Wednesday how much he has been loving one of my cats that comes to visit.    

I feel betrayed
The cat is prettier than I'll ever be 
We have all been AirBnB-ing wrong!!!!! That the best thing ever
That’s the best way to wake up. 
That is a cute ass kitten
"Good morning hooman!  Welcome to my home. I'll be taking care of you for the duration of your stay.  Tips in the form of pets and skritches are encouraged and appreciated."
Neighborhood cat climbed through our window in an air bnb in Iceland… chilled with us all week, slept in the house with us, and followed us down the street whenever we went our. We named her Salem :)
Stayed at an AirBnB once where owner had a big dog and a cat. Dog loved coming to chill with you if you left your door opened, so of course I did. Cat would sneak in and play under the bed. Cat ended up stealing a pair of my socks. Couldn't even be mad. 
This is why I love AirBnB, I've met some of the coolest pets. Just the other day in Little Rock the host's Shih Tzu had six puppies! Six! I nearly pooped myself, I was in Heaven!
That is the sweetest fluffiest babiest adorable kitty. I couldn’t help but smile if that’s what I awoke to in the AM. 
[removed]
He was seeing if you were good eating
HOTELS HATE HIM
Only 5? That kitty deserves twice the stars. 
Below are the links to our Air BnB! If you didn't see my first comment, it is listed that we have 3 cats in our home and we live in it as well! So if you are allergic you won't book with us :) And we can put the cats away during your stay if you want! And we always double check with you before hand, incase you missed it that the cats are in the home! :)
I stayed in an AirBnB where the host lived on the upper level and we stayed on the main level. The host kept apologizing about his cat, but we LOVED her. He ended up writing us a great guest review about how much his usually aloof cat loved us. Definitely inflated my ego. 
Floof BnB 
Dude lowkey looks like Joseph Gordon Levitt lol
We had a cat in our AirBnB when my wife and I went on our honeymoon. The hosts said that usually the cat doesn't visit with people (and reviews/guest book confirmed that).

We were so happy when the cat kept coming back and pawing at our door every night. It really made our stay.
Best AirBnB wakeup call ever
One time I was staying in an Airbnb in France. I woke up at 5 am to a cat meowing and walking across the room towards me. The Airbnb owners did not own a cat. 
That’s my dream AirBnB! 
I'm staying at an Airbnb this weekend. There's 2 super friendly cats that live outside. The host is a little too chatty but the cats made up for it
I rented a villa in Spain last year for a few weeks, it was absolutely beautiful btw, and they had 3 cats that lived there but because the villa was in the countryside they just roamed around the place but every night one of them would sneak into my room through the window and I'd wake up with him purring and flopping around on the bed. It was my favourite part of the whole trip!
My mum rents out a room on Airbnb and has a cute tripod cat. She won't demand to get into the room if the door is closed but if they're open she'll come in. My mum tells that to the guests but most people leave the door open on purpose and the cat ends up sleeping on the bed with them. Glowing 5 star reviews mentioning her 😂
Last year a couple friends and me went to Amsterdam and stayed at an AirBnB. This guy hat 5 cats, and one or two of them would always come into my bed when I was going to sleep, and lay either onto the blanket or besides my head. 10/10 would go there again
I had a similar experience. Felt like crap when I got to my AirBNB and just laid on the bed for a while. My host wasn’t there but her kitty was and she made her way into my room and laid with me. Made me feel better like magic. TY sweet Magpie ❤️
My friend has an AirBnB with 15 cats. It's pretty much the only reason people stay there.
I’m assuming the Airbnb would tell you there’s a cat in the house before you get there though right?
Severe allergy person here. Just wondering. Do bnbs tell you what pets they have?  
Seems like an infallible 5-star feature alone!
I wanna give that kitten a cuddle 
r/curledfeetsies
I love affectionate kitties. My friend has the friendliest cats and I love them so much 🥰
I have the adult version of this cat! She’s a rescue, and so scared... it’s nice to see her baby version. 

Edit: [cat tax](https://imgur.com/a/E27GnQo/)
My favorite Airbnb was run by the most delightful old couple who live outside of Boulder. It was basically a bed and breakfast and they had an awesome cat. They told me and my husband right away that the cat liked to drink directly from the faucet, so whenever I'd refill our water bottles the cat would be right there waiting for his turn lol.
I love airbnbs, but had a HORRIBLE experience in 2017 in Lake Placid NY. They had an "indoor only cat" that was infested with fleas and we ended up bringing several home which created its own infestation with our 2 indoor cats.


We noticed the fleas when checking out, let her know, although she denied the cat having them ((actually had them jumping up my arm when petting)). It sucks, but now we dont trust places that have pets.
We have an outdoor cat, that thinks he owns the neighborhood. One day my neighbor came out and told her woke up that morning with my cat staring at him from the foot of his bed. Must have snuck in a window.
People leave their pets behind when they rent out their residence?? 
Animal prostitution is illegal in most places, check your local laws real quick OP. That’s a swindlers tactic to guarantee a 5 star rating. 

All jokes aside that’s a got damn cute ass kitty ;_;
That's really cute, but they shouldn't allow that, some people don't like cats and / or are allergic. I hope you got a warning at least 
When we were in Greece there were cats just everywhere, but an AirBnB we rented out on Skiathos had one kitty in particular that would come up and rub on your legs every time you left or returned to the property...we extended our stay on Skiathos an extra two days pretty solely because I loved this cat so much. I named him Fluffioς

[Here is Fluffios and I](https://imgur.com/gallery/bwxwlVg) 
Oh my goodness that is so adorable. That is one of the cutest kittens I’ve ever seen. And I don’t want to brag, but I’ve seen a lot of kitties in my day. 
At my place it’d probably be waking up in terror because two bengal cats are chasing each other and decide to use you as a trampoline. Which is also why we’re not an airbnb. 
Nice. Good for you not being allergic. I know a guy or two who would not have rated that high.
I've been in an airbnb where they think the cat is a cute addition, but really my allergies just explode and i cant stay in the accommodation i paid for except to sleep, under heavy allergy medicine.
I love my kitties, but do these Air BnB hosts specify that there is a pet?  Do they expect the guest to care for the pet?  What about people with allergies, or no urge to clean a litter box on their vacation?
OP is a looker too ;)
I keep my cats away from the guests. Maybe I should let then go say hi.
Don't understand this wrong. It was just checking if you are still alive or if you are edible yet.
Where is this place?? I would make a special trip for the sole purpose of snuggling that kitten, and it would be the best vacation ever.
Zuppa the dog had the run of the place at our Florence (Italy) rental. So much Italian fun!
Cute, yes; but question...

You're at an AirBNB. Are you sleeping in the living room? Or  are you in your own room? If you are in your own room, did you let the kitten in your room before bed? Did you lock your door before you went to sleep?

It's cute, yeah...but how the fuck did the kitten get in your room? That weirds me out a little.
May I please have the listing link so I can go too? 
Devious tactics for ratings, just take your 5 stars damnit! 
Are you saying they got a "paws-itive" review?  Ba dum tiss... I'll see myself out.
If this had been me I would have woken unable to breath and possibly died. 
The guy is pretty cute too...
complimentary toxoplasmosis! 
[deleted]
I have seen this pic before on reddit.
Im allergic to cats and Id still give 5 stars 
That's adorable. I just hope that Airbnb isnt illegal like a lot of them.
I love airpets! 
So, who else just got an idea for the next SyFy/Netflix movie about a cat that wont let you leave AirBnB?

No one? Well it my idea now! ALL MINE!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
the cat is salt deprived and is trying to take your electrolytes
498 huh
This reminds me of a time I was staying at a relatives house overnight and woke up to their cat nursing on my ear and making biscuits. It was glorious
All hotels should have an optional kitten service. 
Would book every time.
[deleted]
If I was there it would probably suck for my vacation. I would just spend all my time petting and cuddling with that cutie.
See that's great. But I could never trust strangers with my pet.
Twist: it's not their cat either
You dont get *that* in no five star hotel!
Wow, you can get an AirBnB with cats?!  Does that cost more or was there a discount? I can't imagine leaving my cats fate in the hands of strangers who may or may not understand cats.  Having one shoot out the door would be my biggest fear.  My Bronko is always at the door waiting for his opportunity.  So cute!
That's exactly where my tiny calico named Athena loves to lay as well. She will stare at me until I form a "circle" using my arm, then hops in and falls asleep. Cat are great
Part of me wishes you could filter by cats, but another part hopes you don't due to the extent some people would be arse holes. 
She is such a beautiful baby!
This is such a cute kitty
u/erainthetrain Airbnb!
A kitty licking your eyeballs at 6am is the epitome of comfort.
Now lick the kitty.
So many people say cats should be let outdoors whenever they want. Do you wear ear muffs in the winter to drown out the screams of freezing stray kittens your cat fathered??
Oh my sweet potatoes and marshmallows, look at that little bitty kitty face u/bear-boi
I stayed in an air bnb in Cleveland over the summer and they had a old old old cat named Cletus that spent our entire time with us in our room. Was constantly drooling but he was such a nice cat. Would lay with us and lick out fingers. Really loved that cat. Also a 5 star review 
I stayed at one in Iceland and each morning their black lab would sit outside the kitchen window waiting for us to come say goodmorning. 
Cat.
This is the kind of content that I visit this subreddit for
Honest question, has there ever been any reports of someone harming an AirBNB host's house animals?  I have seen several awws regarding cats being in the rental, but I do worry that someday there will be the one report of someone doing something terrible..
In my experience BNB cats are so fucking sweet it’s crazy
Aw man, I was just at an Airbnb last week.  Great location, nice place, wonderful host, but it didn't come with a kitten.  I'm seriously reconsidering my positive review now.  They were clearly holding out on me.
aww, i would have loved that as well. 

&#x200B;
Oh damn i don't know who i would like more to be, the cat or the guy 😳
Funny thing I have to tell:
So I was on vacation during thanksgiving with my aunt and cousin. We stayed at 3 Airbnb's, one in Paris, one in Brugge, and one in Amsterdam. In the Airbnb in Amsterdam, we we're on a houseboat near the Anne Frank house. Anyways, there was this nice orange cat, who would walk around our street. We saw him a few times and pet him a bit. The next day, while we were walking back to the Airbnb, we see the cat sitting on the porch, watching us. We go inside, and the cat follows us in, and sits on a stool. Now we planned this vacation with my uncle and his fiance (he was divorced from my aunt). They are with us at the time, and when this cat walks in, we just watch it, and play with it. It was a nice cat. 

I'll update this with pictures of the cat.
Man, I'm too cynical and over-protective to allow complete strangers stay alone with my pets.

Regardless, that's awesome!
Genuine question. Do people stay at AirBnB’s while the owner is there as well? Or is more a, I’ll give you a good price if you take care of my cat while we’re out of town situation? Only AirBnB’s I’ve ever stayed at were honestly empty, except for necessities. Like, spare houses or something. 
tanner?? that you bro?
I really wish you could search on AirBnB for places that have cats and/or dogs in the house. I would definitely take a private room with a cat or two for company over a place all to myself with no furry friends around.
Who on earth would leave their pet with strangers renting their home?  That’s bizarre. 
Is that an Air Force PT shirt
Dude...thats how they get you. The old "toss in a kitten , get five stars". Been like that since the romans ran inns. 
Yeah, that could have so gone the other way
I stayed at an AirBnB a couple of years ago where I rented a room upstairs for a few nights. First morning there, I open the door and there are 3 dogs waiting for me who proceed to knock me onto the floor and lick my face. The home owners come up and are like, "Oh my gosh, we're so sorry," and I'm like, "WHY?!"

5/5, would go back
Well looks like you will be returning there. Sweet little cat. 
What the heck kind of parent would leave their furbaby all alone with strangers??! 
Instant asthma attack.
HI AIRBNB FLOOFER! 
Please link me where this is. I will go there, no matter the cost, and experience this myself!
**I CANNOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION**
MY DUDE
I'm allergic and would have reported and given a 1/5 review.
You can tell he likes humans
Cutest kitty! Honestly, that would make me give 5 stars as well. Kitty cuddles are the best.
HI AIRBNB FLOOFER! 
I would give you gold if i could! 
I stayed at my friends for the first time. His sister rented a room there too. Didn’t know she had a dog. We were out drinking and I crashed on the couch. Big couch. Woke up with a big fat pit bull cuddled up between my legs and got smooches for days. 

I wish every day could start with a new random animal cuddling you 
As someone on immunosupressants this is my worse nughtmare. Love the kitty, wouldn't be able to handle the licking.
Sure when a kitten does it it’s cute but when I do it the cops are called.
Good turn out. I would have woke up sneezing and partially unable to breath. 
Check your wallet.
I'm allergic to most cats and dogs.  This would slightly upset me. 
My roommate's cat licks his own balls and asshole. Animals can be cute but I'm not too fond of them licking my face.
I'd rather wake up with you licking my face 
What if you’re allergic? Very inconsiderate of the owners.
Some people are lucky. My kitten just purrs right in my face and bites my fingers.
A couple thoughts on this. If they didn't tell you the cat was gonna be there that's not cool because people do have allergies so they can be potentially putting people in danger. If the wrong person would stay there they could harm the cat or let it out and it's gone. And lastly if no one told me there would be a kitten and I couldn't get ahold of them, cat becomes mine.
This is the most adorable kitten! Does ANYONE know what breed/type of kitten this is? I am in the process of trying to adopt a kitten and this one is so beautiful.
Unless you are allergic to cats.
I'm terribly allergic to cats. They would've gotten a one star review from my hospital bed.
Cat allergies are nothing to sneeze at.  
That cat licked its ass first. Im just saying.
You do realise it probably thought you were dead and was about to start eating your face right?
LOL im allergic to cats, throat swells up and I can't breathe.  
Did the AirBnB specify they had pets? I'm only thinking that if you had a severe allergy to cats or something this would be bad.

I wish my animals would wake me up like that. 5/5 from me too.
[removed]
6 out of 5 stars.
That would be instant 1-star review from me. "Woke up to cat licking my face, spent the rest of the day in the hospital."
How to get good reviews 
Sounds like the purrrrfect Airbnb 😍
r/curledfeetsies
meow meow what a sweetie
Good kitty keeping you clean. 
That's a fricking adorable kitten
Lol @ host for leaving their cat?!

Glad the guest didn't mind. 
How do so many people find random cats when they stay at hotels/b&bs bc I want in on it 
My friends had a cat like that but when it grew up it wanted nothing to do with anybody
Guess you have to buy the house now.
Lucky. My cat would have sneezed in your face.
This looks like the one i saw in seattle
Did you take the kitty home with you?
Does anyone know if that’s a specific type of kitty? Mine looks almost exactly like it and I’ve seen other pictures that are very similar as well. 
Amazing
Awwww that cat is looking like a baby so comfortable...
Lol my friends brother got a few weekend at a nice hotel comped because he was using AirBnB and apparently the old renter had came home all drunk and tried to get in bed with him. Dude woke up all most killed the old dude, and then phoned AirBnB customer support. He did get to stay at a nice hotel. Had the valet park his beater ass car. Though this seems much more relaxing.


That little thing is adorbz. 
That’s one of the most beautiful kittens I have seen in my life. 
When can I sleep there?? 
Where’s his other hand?
Where is this?? I may make a trip!!❤️❤️
It’s my dream to book an Air BnB filled with kittens.
Beautiful 
Imagine if this is an actual tactic to get 5star reviews. 
Let their cute kitty seduce the guests - get 5* review. Works like a charm.
Until a person allergic to cats comes along...
Cat licks own butt, boys face 5 stars. 
That is the cutest fucking kitten ever
Do you go to Quinnipiac?
Aww man I want to stay there🥰
It’s not fair. We just left our Airbnb and there was no kitten kisses. 1/5.
Yes!  Good things making this, sometimes difficult life,....Oh so sweet!
What a beautiful kitten!
Take the cat
Omg this is just so wholesome and beautiful 
The fluffer. Always a successful tactic.
Best room service ever.
Little does he know, they don’t own a cat! Dun dun dunnnnn
Seems like you had a good night 
Awwwww
I honestly have no idea why these AirBnB hosts would trust leaving their pets with strangers. Wtf. 

OP, obviously nothing to worry about with you. But I love my animal too much to risk it. 
Knoxville?
To be fair, cute guy so can’t blame the kitten 🤷‍♂️
Where is that place? WHERE?
Oh so it's breakfast in bed. Nice
That kitten is so cute!!
Did you sleep with your door open at an air b&b? Or is this a very clever cat?
Pretty ballsy to leave your furbaby with a stranger who you don’t know. I could never.
Remiew?
Amen I
Cat, I’m a kitty cat.
Hey... You single?
r/upvotedbecauseboy
My kitty looks like this, does anyone know what breed this is?
sooooooooooo cute!
also the kitten is adorable!
Reminds me of a true story. I sleep in the nude. One morning years ago I woke up on my back with our kitten batting my growing plumper back and forth between its paws. I CAREFULLY reached down and moved the kitten. That was a close one.
You got licks on your face.
So freaking cute, omigwad. 

PS. Kitten as well. ❤️
Plot twist: kitty just ate a mouse in your room
r/ihavesex
We don’t have a cat!! 😳
Can I put in an application to live at that AirBnB?
and there lies the problem with peer reviews, with other assholes, this would have meant a 1 star
Depends what he licked before
Good thing you aren't allergic to cats, though.
Whats airbnb?
Martin Shkreli?
I usually wake up to my friend hooking up with some random guy when I stay in an Airbnb. This would be much better. 
I stayed in an Airbnb and came back in the evening to find the cat had pissed and crapped on my bed.

I left and checked into a hotel immediately.

The worst bit was the Airbnb host refused to refund me and I had to complain to Airbnb.
I audibly squealed. That kitten is perfect 😭❤️
So cute 
You look like muselk
Do they mention they have a cat in the post? I imagine this might be bad fo some people who’re allergic haha
Usually you have to pay for having your face exfoliated.  And that was no extra charge.  Win!
Jealous of that kitten :P
Cute and all but that would be an instant 1 star review from me. Hygiene and allergy awareness are lacking there. That could literally kill me. I don't like when any business let's animals do that stuff. It's not safe
When I had a bedroom in my apartament up on Airbnb, my cat just fucking jumped on the room's doorknob trying to open the door. It scared the hell out of everyone and made them think I was a creep trying to open their door in the middle of the night.
Anyone know the breed of the cat? I want one
Would you rate the cat an 12/10, bront?
You slept with the door open?
Cute cat 
Am allergic to cats. (Probably not 5 stars from me for that but wouldn’t penalize them either)
That's gotta be the cutest little kitty ever!
Wow! In my city the best airbnb thing that happened was someone through a chair from the balcony onto the freeway. Lucky you.
Would happily have one of each please and thanks
That's rare. Something good out of AirBnB
I'm on the Airbnb app right now, and I can't seem to find the "friendly pet that licks your face in bed" option in filters. 
kitty looks so sweet and innocent like she made a mess downstairs but is cuddling so you remember the cuddles before you see the kitchen
Billy?
As a person allergic to cats, I would be furious. 
Hello sweet floof baby !! 
"Even you're at Costco don't forget to order a fresh batch of kittens for our next airbnb guests!"
Imagine if someone was allergic 
Free face wash !! Lol
I always see pets in Airbnb but any chance I could leave my toddler with the guests for some free babysitting?
Wait. People's pets stay when they rent out? 
I fucking love this.
That’s a dream come true!
This comments section is an Airbnb shill
Look at those feetsies!
Wish I were this guy. Also this cat looks just like mine lmao
That cat’d be coming with me
Did you take him home in return for a good review?
Joseph Gordon Levitt??
Jeebus, you look like my brother! He's terribly allergic tho...so you're not him...but WOW!
Cat? We don’t have cat here, Sir.
Oh my god that kitten is gorgeous!!! Reminds me of my little girl! But she's orange instead of black!! 
Aw poor cat
Wait... so do you have to take care of the cat while the owners are away?
Did you throw the patio set off the balcony before or after this review?
Was this the kind where you're just sharing a room in somebody's house?  I've never had the guts to do that, but events like this could definitely change my mind!
Hello allergy
Aw what a pretty cat!
Awww what a cute kitty. 😊 🐾 
Mine looks just like that but shes blonde where the other cat is black
Was this in University Place?
I. WANT. THIS. AIRBNB.
That's such a beautiful cat!! 💙
I don't have a cat, but I like nice cats and I like dogs too. I mean some might suggest I get a cat but I don't really want to have to care for it on a regular basis. Really, I would pay a little money(I can't afford to pay lots of money for instance renting an Airbnb just to see someone's cat) just to be around someone's cat for a while. 
I’m allergic, this would ruin my vacation. Instant 1 Star 
5🌟Cuteness😍P:fection👌
Imagine if you're allegeric. 1 star baby!!
Awww!
Very cute cat! My cat is a little more... Adventurous. He actually laid on my face and choked me while i was sleeping, cheeky one i got.
I guess I’m gonna have to start sleeping with the door open at Airbnb’s???
Just realized I need a subreddit for rating AirBnBs and their animal hosts. I need to be sure I’m meeting the finest floofs on my travels.

Is this a thing? It should be a thing. 
Stayed at an Airbnb on the Isle of Skye and we were greeted by the owner's cat, Buttons, eating a mouse outside 😂 She'd always greet us in the morning begging for pets. Ugh I want to go back
I am so jealous rn
I wanna go home I miss my cat...
Such a beautiful kitty
Why does this never happen to me?! Why can’t random animals (not bears) be next to me when I wake up....actually, a bear would be cool....just a bear cub....or a grown bear during hibernation season. 
I’d rent that AirBnB just for the kitten cuddles. 
How does this type of thing address if someone is allergic? I would imagine you would know there was a cat there going into the situation?
Both are cute :>
AirBnB owner: What cat? We don't own a cat. 
A beauty of a kitty
HOMG! <3
Can anyone explain to me what AirBnB is? 
Gaahh 😍😍
Oh my goodness look at that little face! 
Baby snuggles and loves 💕
It looks like you made that little love *so* happy!
I wish I could upvote this a million times!!
Boop 
He looks like he could be my kitten’s long lost brother!! [photo of my lil boy, Mozart](http://imgur.com/aslQ38X) 
Mine came with a beautiful golden lab, no bedroom access though...he would come to me for attention other times, loved it.
What if it shat on your face? Still 5 star reviews?
OMG! I adopted an older cat and we love him to bits, our only regret is we never got to experience his cuteness as a kitten. This little guy looks exactly like him! Squeeeeeee!
Damn, all I got was a mint on my pillow. 
Real question is why you left your room open while sleeping in someone else's house. I guess it could be a floor or basement rental though.
Cute cat. But I’m deathly allergic. I would have a different opinion of my experience. 
100/5 stars!
That look says "watcha doing? "
Kitty looks a little camera shy which makes this photo ten times more adorable 
I was at one with a cat a few months back. Lovely, friendly baby called Minnie. Just before I left for my interview I wasn’t paying her enough attention so she jumped up onto my shoulder from the floor. It was quite a shock, the claws moreso.
I would never trust a stranger with any of my animals
But..... it probably licks a different face every morning
Well, it chose you. Guess you have to take it home now.
um im watching a movie do u mind not posting stuff with the most adorable headers like,,,
That's what happens when you return to the place drunk and pass out on their living room sofa. 
I can't help but think that the review wound be 1 star,  if OP was allergic.
Please leave some for us too
What a wonderful cat! 
Their cats are awesome. They have one little furry black one that was just adorable. 8/8 would stay again. 
What a sweet kitty 
Whiskers is the deal closer
And yet if it had been the owners' son you probably wouldn't feel the same way. Weird, right?
[r/curledfeetsies](https://www.reddit.com/r/curledfeetsies/)
Oh but when I do it, it's a felony! Wheres my equality!
Imagine being allergic
“Aight, so boom: I give them cuddles, they give you 5 stars, you give me catnip” they learn fast
When I'm looking on AirBnb for places to stay and they have dogs or cats I immediately halt my search and book!
that is like, the cutest kitten I have ever seen
Best AirBnB
Only 5 hours in and we're at 105K 👌👌👌
DUDE, THAT'S THE BABY VERSION OF MY CAT
ah such a cute kitten
That would suck for an allergic person
I would want to take it home. 😍
As a person who has insomnia, I'd be pissed having something waking me up somewhere I paid to sleep.
***sounds cool but did it really happen***
Aww

Two cuties 
Aww so freaking adorable! 
My brother and I stayed at an airbnb in Prague and within 10 minutes of settling down in the room, the hosts cat took a dump in his liter box and must've stepped in it, then proceeded to walk all over our bed. Naturally we coined him poopy paws 
A bed n breakfast I stayed at in vietnam came with a litter of  2 week old kittens and the mom curled up on one of the beds. We let them have the bed and the owners gave us food for the mom. Apparently its normal for there animals to claim the rooms when they have litters (another room had puppies)

Hi, OP. Call me. 😂😂😂
I couldn't do a Airbnb too weird for me even though it's cheap. If I can't afford I hotel, I don't travel.
Were you dreaming about a beautiful woman before you realised it was the kitten? 
What a beautiful kitty!! 
Wow
I would die. 
I woke up to the lovely noise of crains across the road building houses.The next 4 years of my mornings are gonna be fun☺
AirBnB kitty in your bed is cute.
Motel kitty in your bed is gross.
That looks like the softest, most floofy kitten <3 the best kitten..
Anyone know what breed of kitty that is?? The colouring is gorgeous! 
Yes.. Except if you're allergic to cat.. 
Where is that Airbnb, i wanna go right now
I wonder if they're conducting an experiment on you to see how you behave around the pet.
I must know where this AirBnB is at. My wife thinks we’re going on a vacation. Little does she know we’re gettin’ snuggle attacks from a kitty! 
Both adorable 
Instant 0 if you were allergic. 
My friend/ride’s car was stolen from outside our Airbnb yesterday. How many stars should we give?
I'm saving this image
Personally I don’t like the idea of leaving my pets home alone with strangers.
You are one lucky bastard. What a great way to wake up. 
Hello visitor I am Cat. I am here for breakfast order. I'll have tuna, plz.
But how did he get inside!!! 
My aunt is severely allergic to cats and would not be happy at all. 
Mmm toxoplasmosis...
I wouldnt be able to give it a rating cuz I'm allergic to cats so I'd be dead :/
You just forgot to wash your face after eating)))
Never in my life have I seen such a brave kitty😂Keep it
I love cats.

Purity at it's finest! I can't handle it.
Damnit that’s a cute cat. And I don’t even like cats. 
Oh this is wonderful! 
I’m allergic af let that kitty try me 
I don't think I could trust strangers around my cats. 
*p r e c i o u s*
BEST AMENITY EVER!!
I’m allergic so it’d be a 1 star from me 😂
You know how normal people take the shampoos hom with them? I'd take the cat 😻
Can I give op a 5 star review?
I'm curious about Airbnb. Do they have houses where you stay with a family and get a room? Or is it an empty house with Airbnb renters and a cat???
Were they in the place with you or did you have to feed the cat? I have pets and I'm curious if people would enjoy having to feed them 
Awwwwww so cute
That means it was gonna eat ya.
Cat:  "Oh, hai!  You're new here.  No rush, but I usually get fed at this time.  I'll just wait for you to get up and take care of that."
Damn that’s a cute kitten
Honestly I'd lick your face too.
Weird how the right eye seems missing because of the lens distortion in the corner haha
I had a guest who called Airbnb and stated that my place was inhabitable because I had 3 glasses- orange juice glasses- in my sink and a throw blanket on my couch, and she wanted a full refund- she booked a month in advance.  She called me and told me it was because I have children in my home and she hates kids. It's listed in my description that I have kids and their ages- they are tweenagers so they are never home or always in their room. I told her she should have read the description of my place and not just look at pictures. My mistake for allowing get in my home before I got home because she helped herself to ALL the hangers in my spare room before she took off. She DID NOT get a refund.
Oh hell no, allergic conjunctivitis would certainly ruin my stay.

Beautiful cat!
Turns out the kitten has pink eye. Thanks AirBnB.. 
TBH if I had an AirBnB listing that  specifically said "There is an affectionate cat on the premises," I would pay a surcharge.
I stayed at an AirBnB at Pittsburgh once, and the owner's cat kept us company.  His name was Mr. T
Seems like a set up 
Here's another picture of Oliver ♡

Do they charge extra for kitty wake up call
I am **so** jealous!
He looks identical to my little man!
I like a car but it cause me a allergie
Was it extra $$$ in total cost?
😍 ♥ 
We stayed at an AirBnB once and the resident cat was the best part of the stay. Not that the location was bad (it was quite nice) but come on. Kitties always make a place better, IMO.
They definitely planted the cat there, probably put some peanut butter on your nose too *mutters in detective*
Ah! That makes sense
Curious how this works. My throat would have closed up and I would have died in my sleep if this happened.

Do they just let the kitten free roam?
The cat is so adorable! 10/10 I would steal the cat. :p 
I think you're right--cats will immediately earn an AirBnB 5 stars. My sister stayed at one the other night. She opened the window before going to bed, and the next morning the resident cat was sleeping in the chair in her room. 
My ex had an airbnb for our spare room while we had two cats. unfortunately one had a habit of peeing on beds, and plenty of guests left negative reviews even after reminding them several times never to leave the door open. I feel like it would’ve gotten us 5 stars if they hadn’t. Still cute little monsters.
Kalem is that you?
So cute! How much karma did you get by posting this and with all the upvotes? 🥰

aww, the jelly bellyness of it all...
Plot twist - YOU were breakfast!

To Serve Man, it's... it's a cookbook!

sooner or later, all of us will be on the menu... all of us
But do they have air bnbs with doggos?! 
The cat runs their PR Department.
It's so little and floofy! I love it when there's a cat at the place I'm visiting 😁
That would be a delight to me.  The kitten is a delight 
I dunno, but they're both pretty cute.

I would probably steal the cat though.
Well, I imagine I'd ***scream like a white lady!*** 

&#x200B;

And then have a sneezing fit — I'm allergic. 
Toxoplasma gandii
That is heaven
SOOO CUUUUUTE 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️
Awwwwww so cute
Great customer service!
What happen if he hate cats ?? 
I’m allergic to cats.

…

Doesn’t mean I wouldn’t try to live here.


The kitten has next morning regret on its face 
Cats usually lick themselves in order to groom. Mother cats will lick their kittens as a part of the grooming process as well. However, cats will alsolick each other as a sign of affection. Cats actually lick humans for one of several reasons, but most of them come down to displays of affection .

Now this is epic 
That cat Is prettier than most people 
Omg what a beautiful kitten
Where the fuck is your left eye dude? Did the cat pick it out?
omg this lil kitten is the cutest thing I've ever seen ❤️
There is really no limit of creativity in terms of improving customer satisfaction.
Do you want to own this animal?
Ugh, that cat is just the cutest. I hope more AirBnB owners do this. More Cats. Everywhere.
You are blessed
The cat is awesome!
So cute!!!!
Yeah, I would wake up to a severe allergic reaction. Instant 0 star review 
Cute until you realize how a cat cleans its butt.  Yeah.
The cat is cute but how did he get inside? 
Cute, and free side of taxoplasmosis!
So cute 
 what the actual flying fuck? Trusting your kitten to a stranger on Airbnb? Sure she's beautiful and that is so cute but what if you were an asshat and hated cats and abused them?
Free breakfast god dam
Can you give us a link to the listing? We needs it!
Where is this AirBnB located? I need to stay there now. 
Best alarm clock! 
Good thing you're not allergic to cats.
[deleted]
What if you were allergic to cats?
Sorry Bob, that's gonna be a hard no and an epinephrine shot from me on this one. 
Umm where is this AirBnB please? Asking for a friend...myself 😁
For me, that would be an instant zero star review.
Currently laying in bed at AirBnB.... now getting up to go look under all the beds. My 4 stars just became one. The bar has since risen 
Nice cat
Or instant refund if you are allergic. 
You can get a flesh-eating bacteria when you let them lick your face.
I’m sure this will get downvoted but AirBnbs should be required to list if there are cats at their locations. It’s not only a tiny fraction of the population that has an allergy.
Not gonna lie. They're cute and all. But I'm so allergic to cats that it would've ruined my day so hard. Instant 2 stars. Yes, I'm the devil.
You look fine 😉
Sorry that was me 😂
Unfortunately you never realized that kitten has worms and has been trying to self-clean itself all night long while you were sleeping.  Blind to the world around you, not able to even percieve this as being a possibility you go through your days as if nothing has changed.  After a short period of time you develop a rash on the side of your face, and part of your nose, that you attribute to acne problems - little do you know that you have worms burrowing into the pores of your skin.  Days, weeks, and months pass and one night staring yourself down in the mirror noticing the overly puffy red cheek you've developed in such a short period of time you question what happened and why you've become so ugly.  Within these disgraced thoughts of yourself you decide to try to pop a pimple, and in doing so while you are squeezing with two of your fingers around what you think is a zit a worm will appear.  It will pop out just like you think a zit would, however it's still half alive, wiggling, moving, crawling ever so slightly you almost didn't notice it at all.  


(:
OP is such a cute smol bean <333
Why do you only have one eye
There was a time in my life where had that been me I would have woken up unable to breath...

Thankfully that cat allergy seems to have completely gone now. 
What if you were allergic to love?
This entire picture is beautiful, even the bed looks super soft
Can I wake you up by licking your face? 
That’s weird, I run an Airbnb and I got the opposite reaction that the cad did. 1/5 for crawling into bed..
Just remember that kitty probably licked it's asshole just a minute prior.
I stayed at an airbnb a few years back with my friends for a trip to palm springs and there was an undisclosed cat on the property that one of our friends was super allergic to. Airbnb ended up giving us our money back for compensation. The next time we booked an airbnb we brought an inflatable turtle and we were joking that we should tell airbnb there was an "undisclosed turtle" on the premises
Sounds like bullshit
It’s a ploy by the owners for a 5 star review.
Well I suppose there are cat people, and there are the rest of us.   I can understand cat people appreciating an animal licking their face, even if that same tongue has just been used to lick the animal's own anus, or chew on a dead bird, or any number of other uses we'd rather not think about.  Personally though, if I was woken by the owner's pet licking my face The owner and I would soon be discussing why I kicked the fucking thing into orbit.  But hey, that's just me....
