The doc is so happy from the overwhelming cuteness
The little tail wagging
I diagnose you with cuddly cloud syndrome.
I love how he picks him up like a phone lol
YES IT HAS A HEART IN IT
Just checking for puppitations
Tiny cloud with legs goes ‘arf’
I love how the cloud just looks back at us. Almost saying: "Ok I am in the air; this is happening. That cold metal circle touched me. Can I go back to being adorable dog now?"
You can just see it in his face, this is a part of why he chose his job
Wow, the moment when the puppy just stops and behaves for the check up.
What kind of pup is that? My current dog could eat it in one bite but nevertheless it’s pretty damned adorable.
Lol he literally just picks it up with one hand, has his way, then as it down and the whole time it's just continuing to wag it's tail
We lost our dog a while back and I spent a while thinking a vet must be such a terrible job - this video shows the light side of being a vet! Holding clouds!
I like how he holds the wiggle for a moment but goes right back as soon as he knows all is well.
Oh.. Oh this sweet tiny bb.. My heart!!

I needed this so badly today. Been crying non stop for hours over things and this made my tears stop. Finally.

Sweet bbs make the world go round 💕 Thank you so much for sharing op
If you blow on that thing too hard it will dissolve
The vet found the pause button :)
Oh my goodness it's like cuteness overload and I want to kiss that puppy! 😘😘😘😘
What an awesome job
Thank you. I needed this today.
He went from "hype" to "wtf is this" real quick
Jesus that was fuckin brilliant
"Wait. What? What is... What? Human? Are you seeing this?"
The way he palmed the dog
I'm sorry, but your dog has terminal cuteness.
Oh man its like a walking sentient pile of mashed potatoes.
Super cute, just make sure it avoids sunlight... don't get it wet... and for the love of god don't feed it after midnight.
This pup is clearly excited lol I wonder if the heart rate is super high
What type of breed is this dog? That's exactly what I want!
I WANT TO UPVOTE MORE
Ahh yes, the rare albino Ewok baby.
I like how when he applied the instrument the dog got really still, like, he didn't know what was going on but was going along with it. Then when he was done the dog started to wag its tail again lolol Very cute
u/vredditshare
I want to check his heartbeat!!!
*Impossible*
I diagnose you with cute.
My heart
i want to put it in the top of my head
I have one of these clouds (Maltese) and she is 7 years old now. Not much bigger and still has the sweetest attitude.  Great companions.
of course they do. They're inbred abominations that nature didn't intend but profiteering engineered.
I need one!
This is so wholesome :-D
This is so adorable what the fuck
Is being a vet fun? This makes it look incredibly fun
oh my god the lil tail wagging r/ntbdbiwdfta
The way the dog calmed down so quickly, I wonder if he could hear the amplification of his heart beat from the stethoscope.
What type of dog is that?
What breed is this little tiny wee lad?

So smoll
What kind of a dog is that?
What kind of dog is this?
Can someone please tell me what kind of dog this is???😍
I needed this on so many levels. It's not even funny.❤❤❤
Hello. What dog is this can anybody say?
Ok but why is he practicing with a literal stuffed animal?
I wish my cat was this calm.
And that vet was like, “BEST. DAY. EVER.”
My favorite part is how its tail is still wagging when he has it in the air.
The dog is like, "I don't know what's going on, but I accept it"
The fuck is a “smoll cloud”?
I love how the dog tried to get away but when he picked doggo up he just stretched his little body and didn’t gave up like “fine take me”
^^^^little ^^^^waggly ^^^^tail
man, I would be so useless as a vet. I would be there just freaking out and dying of cuteness with every single little animal i saw
WHOSE A GOOD LITTLE DOG
He picked him up with the same physics of a stuffed animal
He holds it like a damn burrito 😂😂
Is this a repost? I could’ve sworn I’ve seen this before.
I love that he picks up the puppy like a phone.
Dog is like da fuq
Cloudy with a chance of awww.
I don’t know what makes me happier. This cloud pup or this happy vet who just picks him up while his little legs dangle in the wind so casually
WHERE ARE MY TESTICLES, DOCTOR??
Of course he needs a checkup! Breeds like this have mangled genes and tonnes of health issues
My... heart

It’s full now, time to start the day
That's not how you use a phone..
“Awwww- yeah, your dog’s not ok”
🇭 🇪 🇱 🇵 
Ohmygod im gonna die.
This looks like a flofier version of my pup💙❤️
So cute
Are you at a confectioners, cuz that sir, is a Fuzzy Marshmallow! A new delicacy made of a Marshmallow covered in white cotton candy!

Too cute.
Adorable but how the hell did we go from wolves to that.
Aww. I use the same stethoscope.

Is it true that the new obsession with tinier and tinier dogs has led to people breeding the runts of the litters. to produce smaller offspring?
u/vredditshare
What breed is this?
43% chance of precipitation.
/u/vredditshare
When your dog is so small that you have to pick him up like a teddy bear.
And the other wolves warned him 50,000 years ago about hanging around human camps. Now look at him.
Listen sir!

My heart is beating 4 u
Omg. The cutest thing ever. What a fluffy little bundle of joy!
I want one!
Someone's picking me up.... Activate starfish mode
He is so tiny, what breed is he?
I like how the fluff cloud opens his upper paws in acceptance
So cute!
Aaaaaaahhhhhhhh
Nothing makes me happier than puppies just loving life.
Is that an Ewok?
u/vredditshare
I hate small dogs for the most part, but that little buddy is so fucking cute that I would make an exception.

He's doing so well! Just sits still and looks around, doesn't freak out or wiggle to get free.
What is this type of dog?
“What... what is this? What is happening? That’s cold.”
I fell my Hart crack
Luckily the pupper has fur. You don't get the cold stethoscope face!
Cloud Backup

I would pay every month to have such a job. The doctor is so lucky and he knows it🙂
That's the ugliest guinea pig I've ever seen. I wouldn't touch it.
That’s a sweet little puff!!

That thing used to be a wolf
Looks like one of those toy dogs that bark and do a back flip
The vet looks like a Gibby from iCarly except Filipino
What's the point of the "o" in small? Seriously asking.
Dog: arf arf arf. Arf arf arf
Vet: *picks up dog* Yes this is the veterinarian office. Sorry I cant hear you ma,am hold on I'll direct you to a German shepherd.
This dog looks exactly like Snuffles from Rick & Morty. 

*snowball enters chat*

Do not call me that!  Snuffles was my slave name. I will now be called Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.
Oh my piano!

Look at that little tail wag! That's the most adorable part
Is this a poodle?
Don’t squeeze the cloud too hard. I love how much the vet is enjoying himself.
So basically he is very smol and cute
Smoll dogs especially need checkups due to the inherent health issues
What breed is this pup?
When you make sure your food is healthy before eating it
Puppy.exe has been paused
He picks it up like it's a taco.

So...he can hear the remaining battery life?
I need to know what breed this dog is ASAP. I need this in my life!
And that was the day that vet found out that cuteness overload is a thing XD
Breed?
Can someone enlighten an old fart here the origin of the terms 'smoll',  'pupper', 'doggo', 'fren' et al, that I see here and on Imgur all the time? Call me a miserable old git, but I have to say, I do find these terms at best, schmaltzy and at worse, childish.
What.is.that.floof?!

Yeah, because teacup dogs are known to have more health issues.
Does anyone know what kind of dog this is?
Cute little Russian dog spy
What breed is it?
I just fucking LOVE how the dog is excited, stops the excitement when he is held still to allow the doctor to do his work, continues with excitement after the doctor starts moving him again. It is SUCH a beautiful thing for me.
What kind of dog is this? So fluff.
It's hard to believe there's like, organs and stuff in that thing
You think doggo loves it because he can hear his own heartbeat?

That would be cute.
I’m going to be real with you 




That is easily the cutest thing I’ve ever seen period and I now desire it




Could anyone please tell me what kinda dog this is it’s fucking adorable
I seriously needed this in my life. Thank you and your smol cloud for making my day a lot better :3
Forbidden Cotton Candy
I work in an animal hospital and the best part of the job is cuddling the puppies and kittens. 🥰
That tail...
Once the vet had that thing on, the Dog was Like: "what now?" Love it.
Holy crap it's even smaller than my dog

I like how smoll cloud stops wagging his tail while the vet listens to his heart. Like 'Oh this is serious time. *Pause* serious time done. Back to wag time'
this is so cute
So so Cute
That man has never been so happy to be a vet

Imagine if this was your job.

This is adorable, but don’t very small dogs like that have breathing problems and don’t live very long? (I might be wrong but that’s what I heard)
My periodic PSA:

Animal hospitals need donations of blood. You can save someone else's pet's life by signing up yours to be a donor.

Even if the doctor finds out that the dog is sick, he will overlook the situation because of the dog’s kindness, so that the dog’s mood does not turn, he will smile at him.
I wish that my patients weren't cute and agreeable. Mine are of the human variety, often poorly behaved, lacking in basic manners and don't listen.
Why is small spelled as smoll?
Thing'll probably die of a heart condition or God knows what else within a couple years.
I find it funny that doctors do so many years of college and still don't realize that of course someone's heart (including that of dogs) is going to still keep beating as long as the animal is alive lol.  You don't need a stedoskroup lol idiots
small\*
I’d smash that lil shit 😍
