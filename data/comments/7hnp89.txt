I can feel the love radiating from that second picture. This is too beautiful for words. 
Thank you for this. My cousin’s son has Downs. From birth, he hated strangers. When I first met him, he was almost a year old. My family said “don’t be discouraged if he doesn’t want to be around you.” 

The whole family surprised me at the airport and brought him. He surprised everyone by reaching for me immediately... and every moment after, he stuck to me like glue. He had this thing that he’d do with me and no one else (then or ever since) where he’d yell “ahhhhhhh” and lick my face. I’d tilt him over where his head was almost on the ground and he’d giggle like crazy and I’d lift him up straight and he’d yell again and lick my face and giggle until I’d lean him over again. It was Christmas week and I ended up being the person he chose to sit on my lap and open his presents. 

When he was 3 or so, I moved down there. I rented a room from family and he’d yell “KNO KNO” Like “knock knock” without the “k” and then stick his toes and fingers under my bedroom door. When he was convinced I had seen them, he’d bust open my door and climb in my bed and point to the tv. I could just continue doing my computer work while he watched cartoons in my bed as long as I let him wear my pajama pants as a scarf. Every time I looked over, he’d give me a huge grin. 

I haven’t been down there in 5 years or so. But I miss that kid so much. 
I have a sister with downs and her mental capacity has declined so much of as late. This brings tears to my eyes because I know the beautiful heart she has and how she used to express it. I miss the love she used to show so much. Lately she barely acknowledges me. Thank you for making that loving gesture to your brother. His reaction is priceless. 
So sweet! :) I have older sister with Downs. She's 37 now and I could not be more proud of her. She is so independent, she know how to read, write, sing, playing zither and much more. She can even prepare food on her own. 

&nbsp;

It is important how much time do you spend teaching Downs people  in early life. My mother did a fantastic job; she pretty much dedicated her life for my sister. When she was born, doctors said that she won't be able to do any of those thing she can do it now. But my mother prove them wrong big time ! :) 
keep showing him the love!! 
The picture on the right brings a tear to my eye, such an amazing photo.

Those with DS are some of the most loving human beings on this planet, and your photos show that perfectly.

Thank you for sharing these awesome photos! <3
Your bro is absolutely rocking that beard.
Well... here's another human with more courage than me, because I am too scared to hold a delicate baby.
My son's not a baby anymore and he's sleeping now, but I had to go into his room and hold him for a moment and tell him I love him after seeing this.  I'm still crying.  I've had a pretty brutal month in a lot of ways and I didn't realize how much I needed this.

Thank you for reminding me that love is something we all share and that we all need; that it's not complication and suffering and labor and hardship and duty; that it's simple and pure and joyful and fragile and the most important thing in life.  I need to love more like your brother does.  I think we all do.
Show him love for as long as he lives. Help him solve the little problems. I had a cousin with Downs that was not expected to live past 21. She lived into her 60's with love from the family. She learned to write her name and recognize some words. Her focus was amazing. I miss her.
Wow thank you Reddit! I'm legitimately choked up at all the kind things you internet strangers said. I wish I could communicate all of it to him. I'm really touched and can't wait to show my parents all the uplifting comments. 100% chance my mom will start sobbing in a good way (there is more rejection for him as an adult because maybe he is fidgety in public or does a number on someone's toilet 😂 etc. So with all the encouragement I bet she is going to be so torn up). I think you just gave her the best Christmas present ever. Thank you all a million times! Really, I had no idea so many people would be so goddamn nice.

Note: I never actually heard the term downsie in a derogatory way but I can see how that might be a thing. I thought it was an affectionate reference. I hope it's obvious from the context it is meant to be loving. 
This post is too pure for this world. So much love for you and your family. 
This made me sob on my toilet. Can't wait to show it to my fiancé when I get out of here.
I HAVE A BABY YOU CAN HOLD DAMMIT. 
Aw man. This makes me wish/ want to put in more effort to make a positive difference in someone's life everyday. Have my upvote.
Thank you for sharing this joy to the us all, what a beautiful thing to see. I’m sure he’ll be the best uncle & he will do so with such pride 
I would have cried. Congrats on the baby and congrats on having such an amazing brother.
Oh my god man. Love him, he is the best there is. Thank you for sharing this, im going to wipe my tears now, man up and wait until evening to hug my daughter. 
This instantly made me cry! So sweet ❤️😭
This is so perfect. Definitely an r/aww with some extra awwwwwwwww
Okay I'm officially done interneting now.  That second pic - I can't.  So pure and beautiful....
Fucking cute. Both of them.


You can totally *feel* the love coming through the screen. Awesome pics. Warmed my old, cold heart right up and made my evening. Probably the day tomorrow, too. 
I especially love the one on the right. The way your bro is so tender, and holding her so carefully - but still gets in the good snuggle and 
(presumably) a whiff of freshly clean baby. Ahh. Gotta love him💕
Reddit doesn’t deserve this much love, but thank you for raising awareness for downs. 

I almost cried at the line “...it’s rare someone lets him now.” What a travesty! People with disabilities, let alone downs, are some of the sweetest people on Earth. 

My brother has downs too and no matter what I’ll always believe he has to be the most down to earth person I know; he’s very kind to anyone he meets and happy to help in anyway. Shame on anyone who discriminated against people with mental disabilities. 
I just had a daughter days ago... If the stars aligned I would let him hold her. The scope of life quickly changes when visceral love is involved. Long live happy people and humanity. 
This warms my cold, dark heart. 
Every baby should be cuddled like that, and everyone should get to cuddle a baby like that. So much love in these photos.
That is so sweet! My autistic brother, who is also low functioning, likes to pet animals but he likes to push the skin on their heads back so their eyelids lift off their eyeballs so he can look under their eyelids. It’s super creepy and I stop him every time he does it but the animals keep coming back for it so it must not bother them too much. We used to have a cat that would sit there and purr as he poked and prodded her like that. 

Edit: Your Brother is so gentle and affectionate. You are super lucky that he has those qualities. 
That's the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
😊
My heart is so happy for him, that’s so awesome!!! :)
This look reminds me of my late uncle who had severe CP, and when he held his brothers(my uncle) child for the first time. My uncle passed 5 months after my cousin was born. It’s a look someone cannot easily forget. This is the most goddamn heart felt thing reddit has ever provided. And DAMNIT we’re crying as a team.
This is my life's work ideal of helping families *get here*. I am jelly and so happy. This is not about me but I needed it, thank you for the inspiration.
Good on you OP, he looks so happy :)
Congrats on the little one OP!
Right on. 
cute as hell
Your daughter is going to have a really cool uncle. 
I have a fairly negative view of humans on r/aww........but damn it, rules are meant to be broken cause that gets me right in the feels. ❤️
Holy shit there are some awful comments here.
My brother also has Down syndrome. 
This is a beautiful moment. Thank you for sharing :)
"I love this baby, I love everyone"
This should be on r/upliftingnews. Love seeing happy folks :)
Thank you for sharing this most awesome photo.  After a trying day this makes my heart smile.
That's beautiful. I wish you well, into the future. I hope your baby can reciprocate, one day.
That second picture is how I always felt cuddling with my babies. Now they're too old, but I recognized that look. So adorable.
Beautiful. <3
Ok, call me old news-- but how has "downsie" become a specified term of endearment for this demographic?
Is ‘downsie’ a thing?
That's Fuckin precious.  
Is “downsie” the affectionate term used for people with Down syndrome? Or are you just being a brother 
You're a good brother and father. I'm sorry for your brother's condition. I hope your whole family has many more beautiful moments like this.
Omg the baby plucked his eyeball out *Kill Bill* style.
r/MadeMeSmile 
He is gonna be an amazing uncle, never separate the two. That is an amazing show of pure love and connection.
❤️ pure ❤️
Pure love... thank you for sharing this 
The amount of love he has in that right photo is insanely beautiful and so innocent. That is truly beautiful. 
Honestly, God Bless you, your brother and your family
So adorable, way to make it happen for him 😊
When they a picture is worth a thousand words,  I'll know to show them this.  It's simple yet holds so much beauty and love.  It truly speaks for itself thank you so much for sharing OP 
- may your brother be loved on so much more this Christmas -  he has a big heart ❤️ 
This is one of those beautiful moments in life we all need a little more of :). So heartwarming, it makes me happy
I love this post! It’s so heart warming 
That indeed is incredibly cute. :)
Looks like he gives amazing hugs
I am a recently new father and I am nearly in tears that you got to share this joy - the joy of holding a baby - with your brother. Happy holidays.
Looks like a good guy. Got a good beard going too!
And this folks, this right here is 100% true absolute love. Its beautiful.
This is absolutely beautiful ❤️
That's a true precious moment.
This is beyond words beautiful. 
Why’d you gotta make my cry man :,)
That is such a beautiful moment you captured, thanks for sharing it 😢🙂
My son has Down syndrome as well, he’s 4 now. He has cousins who are babies and he’s amazing with them, always kissing and hugging them lol. Great post op!
I am very fortunate to have worked with Down syndrome students. These students were nothing but love. I could be having the  the shittiest day but I knew as soon as I walked into the classroom, I would be greeted by the most genuine smiles and hugs and it would brighten my day. 
Thank you for sharing with us ❤❤❤ your bro is a sweetheart
Frame it 
His face is made of pure joy.  Bravo for you and the wife sharing this with him and making him so happy. I hope you have many more moments like this with him.

I actively reject holding babies
[deleted]
They both look so content. So sweet. My aunt has Williamson's and loves babies, we call her the baby whisperer. Give her a baby, baby goes to sleep. 
Great story, thanks for sharing!
More please!
That's beautiful.
My Goodness. Love in its purest form. I will remember this beautiful picture for the rest of my life. Thank you for sharing it with us. Please give your brother a big hug for me.
He's going to be a good uncle. 
This is such a beautiful moment. Thank you for sharing it with us all :’)
That's pure love right there. There is hope......
all the love 

i’m glad he has her. i’m glad she has him. i’m glad they both have you. blessings all around. <3 
I always thought downie was an insult...
Such a great picture. 
That really perked me up. Been a rough day.

Edit: Thanks for the smile :) 
Downsie? My sis has downs too but I never heard this word. 
You've got one hell of a brother, OP. Cherish these moments, and let your children know that just because their uncle is a little different, he doesn't love them any less. Hell, it seems like he loves them more than the average person would for their own niece/nephew. Much love, from one person with special needs family to yours. Happy holidays
Being an uncle is great. He's gonna love it.
"Downsie" ? I've literally never heard that before, but it sounds wrong. 
I have a brother with Down syndrome . He loves babies too . Lucky he has a sister who has 4 so far lol . He’s an amazing helper too. I have many pictures of him holding all my kids .
This is beautiful.

For the last 2 years I have had a child with Down syndrome in my kindergarten/Grade1 class. I sobbed last week when it came time for them to move out of my room.

It has now become my dream to work with people who have Down syndrome.
He loves that baby. Compassion and love, the best human traits. 
Everyone deserves love 
The power of kindness and love!
What a beautiful moment to have preserved like this! Everything from her obvious comfort in his arms, to his sense of peace when she settled against his shoulder. His joy radiates. 

Thank you so much for sharing this with the wider world. 
This is absolutely beautiful. Thank you for sharing. You're a good brother, I am sure of it. 
That's just awesome man.
Omg, they are so cute! Such a beautiful moment, thanks for sharing this with us. :)
You are just the best brother
This is beautiful. 

Thank you for sharing this. Made me smile on my boring work commute.

Much love to your brother, family and beautiful little girl from rainy London Town 
That's love. 💘

My brother has down's syndrome and from what I see, has a monobrow similar to your brother's. Do you know if this a common thing among people with down's syndrome?
Be still my heart. This is beyond precious.  
Oh man melted my heart ❤️
Who the f is cutting onions here?
Who's cutting onions...
Very Very cool ! I have a sweet cousin  who is fairly high functioning, in fact, functioning far better than most allegedly normal people, unusually she is almost my age, 54! She's just great!
Do you ever give him dolls? 
My sister has an undiagnosed syndrome that comes with an overall developmental delay and some coordination issues. But she adores babies and little kids. It breaks my heart seeing some of my family members getting so edgy around her with them and limiting her interaction when she is well aware of her limitations. 

I'm due in January and I cannot wait to let her cuddle her new nephew all the time. 
Wow. Our brothers are almost identical!
So beautiful, god bless him.❤
I can totally relate to your brother because I want to hold my cat like that but he won't let me :(
I wish even half the humans on Earth could have that much love in their hearts. I have no connection to him, but by just staring at this picture, I can FEEL his love. Your bro is a total bro, bro.
that is amazing and your brother is beautiful no matter his quirks
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve seen in a long time. Your brother is an angel and is going to be a great uncle! 
Almost? I almost have to leave work early so no one sees me cry. That's awesome bud
The way you love your brother and the way he loves your daughter is beautiful 
Why is it rare that someone lets him hold babies now? He looks so happy :) makes me happy 
How old are both of them?
Look at the love in the picture on the right, so sweet! 
These remind me I am lucky beyond measure. Thank you for sharing. 
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
Awwesome
aw this is so pure 
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve seen today. 
The baby seems calm and at home with your brother, he obviously has the magic touch!
Lovely! 
I was having a bad day until I saw this picture
That’s beautiful!
Wholesome af
That is so cute. 
I LOVE this!  Beautiful picture.  He's just beaming and the baby seems pretty content with him.  Beautiful!
Jeez i thought he was the father at first. He's showing so much love here
Your brothers happiness is contagious. 
OP almost cried....I did cry...the good kind
Aww bless! His face is full of such love and joy. Beautiful pictures
This is so god damn sweet. A piece of me just melted. 
This post makes me feel truly inspired to be a better brother/son
This is really sweet! Babies know and understand that kind of love too.
this is waaaay to beautiful for words to express. 
Love it! 
Beautiful! 
In a bad mood and was considering why live life but this, THIS made me smile. 
Seriously why won’t people let him hold babies anymore? So long as they have developed neck muscles he seems more than capable of holding one well. My dad had two strokes and only has the use of one hand and he constantly holds my son. There are days where it’s like he’s a baby whisperer and my son will only calm for him. 
Literally made me teary-eyed ♥️ Sweet love
God is good😍. He is already being a loving uncle.  In return, your daughters perspective will be enhanced by just getting to know him. This made my night ❤️. 
Too precious. 
Please tell him I said his beard is epic. 

Edit: misspelled please
This is absolutely beautiful. What a wonderful uncle to have growing up! 
This is the most adorable and perfect thing I've ever seen.

I'm not crying, there's a stick in my eye.
This is honestly beautiful. This probably made you cherish your brother to an entirely new level. Levels just keep going up. Thanks for sharing.
You beautiful son of a bitch!!!  Love me some Downsies and babies!!!   Best of of both worlds Brother!!!  Mazel tov!!!
I wish i was as happy as this dude
This is beautiful snapshot of what pure, honest love looks like. Thank you for sharing.
:D
That's adorable. 
Almost?! What kind of stone heart do you have?!
You definitely cried ;) 
I’m envious of that beard!
My heart sings when I see beauty in this ugly world.
So freaking cute!!! 
Thank you so much for sharing this picture with us. I want to hug the both! 
Love knows no boundary. 
I'm gonna cry too
That is called love my friend. Both of them are happy to have you in life.
What a lovely photo. I was wondering how old your brother is? In the second pic he looks super young!
MEGA Love and karma buddy. I almost cried.
Thank you
I see this as love transcending labels.  What he has trouble expressing is clearly shown in his actions.

my heart...
Cute! Tearing up rn!
:’)
those damn onions again :,)

“Downsie”. Yikes. 

It’s a lovely photo, though. 
[removed]
All the love! It's a sad world without people with downs, I think we need someone like that around us for the sake of our humanity.

(my host brother had downs, taught him for a year, he learned some simple words and numbers and he was so happy to draw or pick flowers or stroke the dog..he was gentle, and diligent, and happy, I miss him sometimes.)
[deleted]
That baby is jammin out
When people call persons with downs I one hundred percent agree with them but I explain why. I have had the pleasure to work with and be in the company of many people who have Down’s syndrome and they are BY FARRR the most emotionally intelligent people I’ve met. They experience and show such true , raw, real emotions and it is amazing to be apart of some of those moments. I believe it takes very special people to raise Down’s syndrome children as it is a life-long commitment to parenting. I’m at an age where I am excited for planning children in the near future and I can say, even though I know a little of what parents go through, I would be terrified at if I learned that my unborn baby had DS but I would consider him or her to be a gift and a great challenge worthy of taking on!
I'm tearing right now. Having 命は美しい blasting through my headphone didn't help either. 

Send my love to him & your daughter. 


Do you what you did! His pride and joy that you stripped from him, you have them back.

We all long to be trusted and treated humanly (among other things) and your brother is no exception. Good on you and your wife.

God bless you all 😊

Why do they call it "Down's" syndrome when most of the time they seem happy?

Empathy sympathy works in mysterious ways!!!
Shoot, now imma start to cry from this or the sleep deprivation

Is his right eye okay? Or did it not form or is it just a weird blink. 
Maybe don't call him a "downsie".
Only almost ?

A "downsie"? That's an acceptable reference to a person with Down's syndrome is it?

Edit to add, your downvoting shows you ignorant morons don't even know how offensive this is.
i'm fine its just a terrible day for rain.

I love this...but “downsie” is a new one for me? Not crying you are!

Yup, he imprinted.
Gotcha. I hear ‘downs’ quite often from a lady who has a niece with Down’s syndrome and I’ve always been a little wary of the word.

How fucking dare you call your brother a 'downsie'. 
Why didn't you?
