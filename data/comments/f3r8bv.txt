Sadness! :( But so cute
BRING HER BACK.
Bye friendo :(
Play mode deactivated
So much flufffff
Me on prom night as my date leaves the after-party with Derek.
This is the part in the Disney movie where the humans are clueless to the dogs efforts to save the kids and ripped the dogs apart. Nice going, humans. Real nice.
You can see the *exact* moment that did realized his friend wasn't coming back :(
And IIIIIII will alwaaaays love youuuuuuu
Honestly the most heartbreaking part of breaking up with my last girlfriend was that when I was driving away I could see her dog in the window watching me and I knew we would almost certainly never see each other again. I was dating her when she got him as a puppy. Fucking heart wrenching man.
I think my heart just melted
He can finally fart now
This actually made me sad
...n now is time for 'bye', my friend

i'll watch you from the door!

i wish this day would *never* end

n we could play some more . . .

'*Tomorrow can she come again?!*'

am wagging my 'goodbye'

'*I'LL WAIT RIGHT HERE FOR YOU, MY FREN!!*'

am trying not to cry . . .


i see you there - you in the back

EDIT: Hi! Unfortunately, I am banned in that subreddit so I couldn't reply to your comment. I was still able to reupload your video though! https://imgur.com/Oe8e5YW.gifv
Aw this is breaking my heart. Bring her back!!
Just invite her back over for a double date with y'all
Call your vet if their tail stays up for more than four hours though.
NOOOOOOOOOOO WHY. I'm going on vacation today and I have to take my dog for his first kennel trip, it was hard enough already lol. This is adorable.
Me too buddy....me too
I say awww involuntarily everytime I see a post from this subreddit in my popular feed without even realizing which subreddit's post I'm looking at. Every god damn time, lmfao.

The happier the play date, the harder goodbye.
Holy hell, that hurt me in the feels.    Dogs are too pure for us.
"Hello darkness my old friend..."
Please tell me they got back together
Everyone has heartbreak
Omg bring her back!
"I'll be happy again, it's just gonna take me a while, ok?"
I have a husky and my sister has a Australian Sheppard that are the same age. When we get them together they play as hard as 2 dogs can. There is always a weird period when they leave where they get depressed. She watched her a week when we went on vacation and that was the worst. We had to get them together again because they both stopped eating.
Even a dog has a date and I‚Äôm alone
I can't decide if I should upvote this or downvote it, you monster. üíî
I miss you already,please come back soon.

That tail droop was so dramatic, I can feel the doggo‚Äôs sadness
I fucking cried a little bit.
Well if that ain't r/aww I don't know
Hey, I've had things just droop like that, too, after my dates leave. Just sayin.
More and more I think of dogs like perpetual two year olds.  Would react similarly when a playdate ends.
AwwwwwüòÅüëâüò≠
Aww.... I hope they meet again :(
Nooooo.... don't leave me!!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Its enough to make a grown man cry
Dog had a date today. I did not.
Oh.... puppy love is the cutest.
He deserves all the pets
"Valentine's is over. Please return to your dog bed."

Something just broke...ah forget it, it was my heart.

I Don‚Äôt ever want to see this negativity again
That was the saddest, most relatable thing I've seen a dog do ever.
That's the saddest thing ever someone hug him!
I wish r/aww would split into two subs. One for "aww, that's really cute" and one for "aww, that hurts a little."

This vid would be in the latter.
Hello darkness my old friend
Not even fair how sad this is. Poor doggo :(
THIS IS UNFAIR on so many level . This cute guy does not deserve this
There aint going to be any fucking tonight buddy :((
I‚Äôm pregnant and extra hormonal, and now I‚Äôm crying (probably unreasonably hard) over this...
***THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS, THIS IS UNFAIR!***
This is the wrong kind of aww :(
This is more sad than my Valentine's Day.  Pretty sad.
You can literally see the exact second he loses hope üò≠
I will remember you, do da do do do...
oh noo :(

Probably thought right up to the last second, or at least hoped right up to the last second, that they were just running out to the car for something and coming right back.

YOU BRING HIS DATE BACK TO HIM RIGHT NOW
This broke my heart a little bit

Mamacita noooooooooo
Oh no poor baby
Well now I'm sad
That's doggone sad.
Thats sad...
You can see the exact moment his heart breaks in two
Poor puppy and it is so cute!
This is pretty much how you would describe a man's penis.
I mean, she *did* get in a car with another man.
awww i want to hug him :(
Breaking news: Internet unified in  demanding doggy playdate resumes immediately.
Such a relatable feeling. ‚ÄúBye! This was so much fun! Have a safe trip home! See you soon!!! ... :(‚Äú
People misinterpret dog tail wagging. Sure, there must be some visual body language component but the main purpose is to facilitate butt sniffing at a distance.
He kept it up as long as possible.
Hello darkness my old friend...
This made me say aww out loud once that tail drooped. So much awwww. Thanks for sharing !!!
Baby come back! Any kind of fool could see...
Great,  now I'm picturing my dogs doing this every time I leave for work in the morning.
here I am 40 years old and had the exact same feeling tonight.  

gf lives with her family and can only stay with me until 12:00 then needs to go back home to sleep.  

wish we could have cuddled in a ball until the morning.  sorry doggo, I know the feeling.

before anyone talks shit, I live in a country with a very traditional culture where children live with their parents until the child gets married and often even still live with one of the couple's parents even after they marry.  so, again, before anyone talks shit, my gf is only 5 years younger than me but the culture here is such that there is no way to stay with your significant other all night.
That moment near the end when they realize they're really gone. So sad.
Would be so much easier to tell what people want if we just had tails
The disappointment isn‚Äôt in the face, but in the tail.
*Jurassic Bark*

I love how even the dog gets a date, but I don't.

I love how his tail swings are proportional to his hope of his date coming back. 

Its okay buddy, she/he will be back <3
That was sad. I couldn‚Äôt finish it.. Can someone give me an update what happened after the dogs tail went down? Did the dog jump out the window and chase the car to an ultimate reunion??

An entire anime episode in one GIF. F.

Excuse me. I need to badly cut some onions now.
SOMEBODY HUG THAT GODDAMN DOG
If you turn the volume all the way up you can hear the heartbreak :'(
And this is one of the reasons I‚Äôm against tail cropping. They use their tails for many things, including communication.
Poor boy
Oh no!!! Come back friend! I can't imagine being a dog and your friends just taking off without any warning...
