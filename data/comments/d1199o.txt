Last day of pool season before they drain and clean. What a great idea.
Is this what heaven is like?
Can we get a full-length film in 2020?!

Edit: For real though, I think the shelter could make some extra money by live-streaming the event!
Not gonna lie, the video still isn't long enough. :P

I could watch this all day.
Well never thought I’d see myself and my dog in a random reddit video... but there we are. Hahah
Oh my gosh! My mother entered her chihuahua in this puppy pool party for the bathing suit competition and she won first place today! Im 90% sure this is the same place (IN?) they went earlier in the day for the small dog event.

EDIT: I’m now realizing Indiana doesn’t have mountains like that. So hilariously where my mom also lives they had a puppy pool party today that benefited the local animal shelter, only they also had a bathing suit competition for the dogs 😂

[The bathing suit champion herself](https://imgur.com/a/8mZWFby)
Somewhere there is a shy dog petting a human in the corner.
I love the dog who's got a life jacket on in what is, at most, 18" of water.
I had the fucking WORST day ever. Literally at one point I threw a bunch of Tupperware on the ground and then cried as I cleaned it up. 

This video saved my day entirely. Thank you so much. I'm poor, please have my fake metal 🏅🎖️🥇
I really like that there are still lifeguards.  Gotta protect those doggos.
Is this Ross Park?
Still less pee than a baby pool.
This is honestly the only party id want to go to
Hi, Reddit here.

We won’t be satisfied until you are live streaming this puppy pool 24/7.
I remember the too-short taste you gave us last year. This is the very best follow up we could have ever hoped for, tysm!
[deleted]
I enjoy that the stumpier dogs have life vests on. Just in case.
Still not long enough. Only acceptable length video is 24/7. Make a channel. I'll subscribe.
I think this is what my dog dreams of at night
I'm disappointed none of them tried the slide...
"I don't want to go to the Dog Park, I want to go to the Dog Waterpark!"
There will be SOOOO much poop in that water... If my dogs are any indication of what the immediate feel of water on their paws does...
We did the same thing at my pool. I wasn’t there, but we talked about it at work today and it turns out 320+ dogs showed up, it must have been a sight to see
This is what pure joy looks like.
Hour long special for 2020 😂
[deleted]
You've done a great service here, but I think maybe it's time to formally start a foundation so that you can stand there and film dogs in a pool all the time.

We could call it "The Foundation to Film Dogs Having Fun in a Pool Foundation" and rake in millions of bucks, but you're going to need to hang in there and keep filming.  We can make you a director and pay you six figures, assuming we meet our kickstarter goals.
Had a shit day and this one post really helped out a smile on my face thank you.
Not to be THAT guy, but is the chlorine in the water dangerous to dogs? As fun as this looks, I can’t help but be worried that it can make them sick or something. Can someone put my worries to rest please 😭
When my boi Travis goes to heaven, I hope it will be just like this.
Next year we're gonna need a livestream.
Ahhhhh! I wish they would do this at the pool in my neighborhood! This is heavenly, but the fact that they donate the entry money is wonderful!  Now if you'll excuse me- I'm going to watch this vid about 309 more times.
You're doing god's work.
The original video?
Why do dogs have life jackets on lol
[if you live close to Pocatello Idaho ](https://idahohighcountry.org/event/splash-dance-dogs/)
I bet that pool has less pee than a normal pool.
I had a bad day today but this made me go to bed with a smile. Thanks.
Holy fuck I could watch this for hours instead of going to anger management.
Next year have someone with a drone take a high angle or directly over head video.
Thank you do much for this. My grandma died today. And this makes me so happy because she loved dogs and she would loved this. RIP Grandma.
This is my heaven. Look at all of those good dogs playing and not fighting. I want to exist here for eternity.
I love this.  Lost my sweet boy in July and haven’t been the same. This makes my heart so happy ❤️❤️❤️ thank you.
Next year we need a 30 minute video.
Ft. Collins?
The one pupper with a life vest on lol.
This is still way too short. I’ve taken longer videos of my cat just kinda looking off into space.
I want to find somewhere in my state that does this! My baby girl would have so much fun
Tbh the dogs are probably less likely to pee in the pool than children..
Haha! I never thought I'd see my local swimming place on my feed!
Live stream next year please and if you can get permission introduce some of the dogs and share their Instagrams 🤷‍♂️
Oh my god they even have a lifeguard. Where do I apply?
I wish places near me did this! This looks like HEAVEN
This is in Pocatello, Idaho at Ross Park in case anyone is wondering. I'm from there and have attended Idaho State University
When I open reddit, this is the content I expect to see first. Great job team.
So many happy zooms
It's nice to see pitbulls in there.
4hrs with 6 awards.   This is going places
Look at all those happy puppers.
I’m crying this is so beautiful!
It makes me happy that the doggos don't have to share the pool with filthy children.
Everyone peed in the pool
If there is a heaven, this is what you'll see.
The thing I love about dogs is you can get a whole bunch of them together like this and they just have fun with each other. Why can’t people be like that?
Pocatello!! I just moved away after living there for 13 years. Never thought I'd see it as the #1 post on the front page!
This is pure joy! Thank you for posting this, lol.

I hope other communities see this and do something similar, such a great and enriching idea for the animals.
👏👏👏 for the people that created this
Is this in Napa?
How can my dog attend
This video is therapy for my frozen cynical heart.
This is the most awsome thing I've ever seen...🙏🙏🤝🤝🙌🙌🤲🤲👍👍👊👊☝️☝️☝️👆👆👆who ever made this happen for all those good dogs is seriously stellar!!
Now I want a dog.
Can we talk about how adorable the puppies wearing life jackets in chest-deep water are 🙈🙈
Ahh this must be what it looks like when people say doggy heaven
Welp. That's definitely what heaven looks like.
My brothers dog is in there. Hi Kai!
I like to believe that somewhere in the multiverse there’s a planet of dogs recording their hoomans at the pool.
This really made me smile after the horrible night I've been having. Thank you so much for this.
That kid at 37 seconds is like fuck this party.
I needed this in my life. Thank you.
This has melted my ice cold heart 💙  please upload a feature length film next year!
They all look and sound so happy. They even have their own lifeguard.
Next year, live feed.
Jealous of that Lifeguard!
[deleted]
I love the one wearing a life jacket lol
[deleted]
I think of the Caddy's day at the pool in Caddyshack every time I see a video like this. 

https://youtu.be/tXTzW01kNJM
Which one are you? I think I'd be the one on the left that was casually walking on the shore
Why isn't this 8 hours long..lol.

I want to watch this all day at work on Monday.
Where is this?
Where is this?’ Can I organize one in my town?
I was a lifeguard and our pool would do this too, after a few hours the cuteness would wear off and people would complain that there was poop in the pool.. what did you expect...
Next year you need to live stream the whole event.
This can't be real. I didn't see one person have a dog shake water all over them.
I’m glad you’ve seen the error of hour ways.
If we complain this is too short we'll get another video next year!
Glad to see something positive from my town for once.
We LOVE this idea and want to do it where we live! Do they have to do anything special to the water in case the dogs drink the chlorine?
Live-stream Splash Dance 2020
Still not long enough!
I wonder if the dogs lose their owners or at least get alittle bit confused???
i like that there's still a lifeguard. best day of work i'd reckon
next year:  live stream.
I just finished dinner and had this gif for dessert!
Will I ever be this happy?
Puppy pool 2: electric boogalo
Cleaner water than at Six Flags
Thanks for no music!
I could watch this all day.
This brought so much joy to my life.
u/fictionalatbest
I love how the big dog is checking out the smaller one in the beginning. The water is so distracting that in only a few seconds, their size difference doesn't matter and they romp off together!!!
This video will never be long enough.
/r/praisethecameraman
Not long enough. We need an hour long version next year.
My local pools call it drool in the pool
Where is this? This is amazing.
As I thought, heaven is on earth.
This is what I imagine Doggy Heaven is like blue 💙💙💙
I hate to be that guy, but it’s still not long enough.
Is this heaven?
When you die and go to heaven:
I remember this from last year thank you for all the smiles
My local doggy day care has a water park. It's no where near this size but my dog absolutely loves it.
Where is this?
There should really be a live feed of this.
..This does put a smile on my face
This should be a livestream.
Still too short man, I could watch a live stream of this shit allll day
This is exactly the quality content I'm here for!! Awesome video, lovely doggos. I love it!
Do small dogs not do well at this sort of thing? Theres no small dogs anywhere.
The one by my house is called Woofstock!
I just want a Livestream of this in the corner of my screen. It's utterly delightful.
I would have joined the dogs in the water
breaking: footage of dog heaven surfaces
that lifeguard has the best summer job, hands down.
I could watch this all day.
When my dog was a puppy I took her to one of these. I held her as she doggy paddled. Then I put her in ankle deep water and she ran out of it. She then crawled into my shirt and shivered the whole time. She hates swimming and I've only seen her swim one time, when I was in a boat and she was on shore and wanted to come sit with me.
Puppy Party all day long...say what??????
“Much longer video”
I, for one, approve.
Dis shit wholesome as fuck
This corner of Reddit is very pleased this year. Thank you, and well done.
You might be the best trying to this sub in a while!
My friend manages a pool and they freaking cancelled dog day because of ALLERGY CONCERNS. Who would show up to this event if they had an allergy to dogs? 

So nice to see the pups running around, they look so happy!
So this year’s video was 5x longer, so we’re getting 6min 15sec next year right?

Can’t wait for the 13 hour livestream in 4 years.
Omg the LIFE PAWSERVERS
u/vredditdownloader
The perfect kind of chaos
I paused my music for this
Only 1:17? I trust you'll do better next year.
So cute, they look like they are having the time of their lives.  


I had a Black Lab who was defective - she hated water.
I appreciate the title of this post. A title this long on Reddit is rarely error-free in terms of grammar. 

I also appreciate the puppies. 💗🐶💗
**Quick:  How many black dogs??**
They're all just SO HAPPY! I love it.
Aww some of them have little floaties
This is amazing
I love how the owners are just standing still without moving an inch lmao
Glade to see my hometown making it on the front page. For a good thing this time!!
BLACK LABS RISE UP
Was this in Wenatchee?
Reminded me of open season
You are a good man, thank you
Dude imagine being the lifeguard on stand. I wish the pool i work at would do this. It would be so fun just watching a bunch of doggos splashin around
Spotted my furry-nephew (along with my brother and sister in law!)

Yay, Poky!
Next year there better be a 15 min video
Awww those where some tired but happy doggos that night
Feel the happys!
It’s missing one good old girl just laying down soaking.
This makes my heart so happy. 

Also makes me miss my little girl, had to leave her back at home when I moved off to school :(
A minute and sixteen seconds?  WHERES THE FEATURE LENGTH FILMM
This is too adorable
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS ALL YEAR!
edit: spelling is hard when you're yelling a lot.
*happy borking everywhere*
oh, but the wet dog smell
Dogs are just the best. Arent they just the best
Yeah but why not make a YouTube live stream and then save it for when i want dogs playing in the background while i work
No chihuhuas running around, I see
Can be get a live stream on twitch or something next time
How does the potty part work though? Also where are the smol doggos?
Are you in Utah perchance? This looks like the Provo rec center.
I’d be the guy running with them in the pool
So cute!! My dogs are scared of water too, but they are cute in other ways!
This is what my heaven looks like.
Holy shit i actually remember the original post from last year! You made my day
I totally wish I was there, too adorable for me to handle.
Oh my gosh!  I love this!  These puppies are so happy.
I especially love the two long legged doggos sprinting together. Everyone looks so happy. What an awesome idea for a fundraiser!
This place is amazing! I know it’d be super insanitary but I would have an extreme urge to jump in there and play with all of them.
I want to join them and hop around too.
Is this Disney land because it looks the the happiest place on earth.
My cats disgusted with this filth.
I actually just went to one as well! My pup and I went in and I literally just blurted ‘this is what heaven has to look like’.
This is so heartwarming to see, i absolutely love it
Thank you, we're happy now.
Next year, live stream!
Make it 1 hour
I want to swim with the puppers!!!
This is the only party i'd ever wanna go to.
It's so adorable aah
I hope our alien overlords see this and treat us the same
My dog loves swimming
My local pool has the same play thing as this one
Still too short. I could watch 3 hours of this.
*Everybody liked that*
If there was really a heaven, I imagine it would look something like this.
It's glorious
Why isn't this an hour long?
Yay! This was just what I needed to boost my crappy mood. Dogs are the best!
Why isn't the lifeguard a dog?
Gosh I wish I was a gosh dang dog this looks fun as hecc
I love the little girl walking by with her arms crossed all pissed she's not allowed in the pool.
I needed this, thanks.
You know the other dogs made fun of the one wearing a life jacket.
Next year i wamt a 4 hour live stream with 3 cameras and go pros mounted to the dogs!!!!
WTF!? Only 1:17? You better come back next year with a longer version!
A lot of stinky rides home coming up.
Man Americans *really* love labradors huh?
Can't forgive
That is such a great idea! Thank you for a lovely video too.
I wish I could be one of these dogs, I miss going to splash pads
So much happiness in one place
What do the tiny dogs that can't stand there do?
You're a good man.
This is a completely foreign world to me. My dog HATED the water. If he were here, he'd be at the gate with his nose pressed into the opening, waiting to get out.
Idea: livestream. Charge $2 or like a pay what you want as donations. I’d buy
Is this eastern Washington?
That Reddit guy needs to take a chill pill
those dogs are breaking all the rules....no swim suits and they're drinking the water
Is this in Fort Collins?
Thank you!  Looks like fun.
Now your reddit is stalked by people trying to find last years
Is this what is meant by The Dog Days of Summer?
Thanks! I love it.
Quality Content! Thanks for sharing!
I highly recommend that anyone who enjoys this follows crittersitterscny on Instagram. Those dogs go swimming all the time.
I know exactly were that is. This makes me happy and mith home, shit I have hair in my mooth.
The sounds in this video are the sounds of happiness. Dogs borking, splashing water and children laughing and shouting.

Thanks for this 💙
[removed]
I mean this is cool and all but why cant everyone play in the water? :(
*This is everything I could want for my Saturday.*
Delivery accepted! Thank you!
Still not long enough!!!
I went to one of these today. So amazing!
Wholesome
It's like dog heaven here!
Smh and they call Disney the happiest place on Earth...
Lucky life guard gets paid to watch over puppers

What if people got along like dogs did?
My local water park does this in December. They donate the proceeds to the local humane society.
I so need my dog to join this!
I want to be there
Where's the viszla running around like an idiot stealing all the other dogs toys!?
Wow, looks like fun
I WANNA GO IN THE BIG POOOOL!!!
That looks like heaven to me.
Did I...did I see a goat?
Still too short :(
It looks like having a lot fun in the water 🙂
this video really made me happy...I love dogs!
Nice to my home town on the internet for something positive for a change! Good doggos!
I love their little life jackets
Where is this at?
When your dogs got more social skills than you
Is this in California? Hills in the back remind me of the Bay Area.
It sounds like nintendogs
We had so many people and dogs today at our local pool puppy party, yours looks perfect with just the right amount of people and dogs.
I must go to here
that's amazing :0
We had the same thing in our town today called the Bark N Splash. We got home at 10am and the dog is still worn out.
Dog
As soon as my tiny pup sees that many larger dogs she’s gonna faint
Look at all those balls!
NO RUNNING!
Is this in Richland,Wa?
That looks like one big ol' bundle of fun :)
My dog try's to bite the water while swimming and he ends up drinking a lot.
/u/vredditshare/
Is there one of these in Sacramento? How do you find out *_*
<3
Oh my God there so cute! Thank you kind stranger 😉
This is my favorite day!!!
They deserve this
Ooooh yeah, that's the stuff.
This is what heaven must look like.
Dogs and more dogs. Heaven on earth. <3
Are humans allowed to be in the pools with the dogs? I think my dog wouldn’t come on the pool unless MAYBE I was in it with him.
If I ever win the lottery I know what I want now
This is the most wholesome thing I'll see all week.
That's adorable. I love it!
It’s not long enough. I want a longer video
In my country we have a park exactly like that, the difference is that the park is always alone
Labs...labs EVERYWHERE
Ah man, so many happy dogs in that video!
Ahw puppies in a zero entry pool!
Is this puppypoolooza?!
Wow
B I G P O O L
Hey I live there! My dog went to that shindig.
Next year we need a live stream.
Whenever I would take my dog to water - she always pooped in it first.   I assume other do the same? 

You know - take to beach.  She runs in waves, poops. Here I am running around with a poop bag trying to grab it out of the surf. 😳
Vegas?
/u/vredditshare
My dogs hate water, they would jump in my arms to not get their little puppy paws wet.
This isn’t long enough. Stream it on twitch next year
I need this to be my life!
All of them are like “why is my humun not coming with me?”
Anyone else imagine the kid complaining to his mom as 2 dogs?
Still not long enough. Next year you need to stream/record the whole thing!
Still not long enough :)
LMFAO
That's crazy, never thought I'd see a video of my hometown on here. That's a lot of happy pups.
Meanwhile my dog is scared of a puddle
Anyone else looking for floaters?
Hi Y w   To is   How I wanna
The ducking mods on reddit are a bunch of fucking snowflakes they shut down all post for the lamest of reasons. Sucks to be offended so easy.
So many black labs!
Why do some of those dogs have life jackets? Are they afraid they might drown in 10 inches of water?
Where?
just what i asked for
My allergies :(
I see a lot of black labs. Are they gaining popularity?
I really wish they had something like this for my dogs where I live.
how the fuck dogs there socializing yet every animal my dog sees he tries to fight it
I would literally travel across the country to bring my dog here. Where is this and when is the next time they do this?
Every dog there: BEST DAY EVER!
The perfect pool doesn’t exi . . .
a pool near me does this too !!! i love this !! it’s so fun to see all the pups playing together in the water
Adorable. Only problem being, is I would like to splash around with these doggos and people don't seem to be allowed. Understandable, but I wanna play damn it.
YESSSS!!!!!!!!   Yessssss!!!
#mother, do you think we could venture to the larger capacity pool?
Joy joy joy
I hope all those dogs went home with their rightful owners. Or maybe it's an annual doggo exchange.
How would I attend one of these puppy pool parties?
Thanks, OP. This is great 😊
This is AMAZING!
Surprisingly little peeing, pooping, or chugging. Good dogs!
For a moment I thought if I could be one of them
lot of fine breeds out there. Even a german shepherd in the back
We had ours here in Austin. All the surrounding towns do it to. It was a great day today for my pup. She’s exhausted.
Where is this i think ive been here before
Where is this?!
Low key mad this is not 16 seconds 🤣
850
I'm mad reddit video prevents me from downloading this video 😭
Dogs: hates shower/baths 
Also dogs:
Amazing no women are getting wet.......the jokes write themselves
Yes
The sequel we all wanted
God fucking bless you.
Buy a room fan, tape camera to it, turn fan on to swivel mode, make live string, become king
So dogesome
u/vredditshare
How do they all know which ball is theirs?
This makes me so happy.
I like this
I would like to have as much fun doing anything as these dogs are having playing in the pool.
Wow that looks like a blast!
I wish my dog liked other dogs and water. Don't get me wrong I still love him not matter what.
Thank you so much for doing this. I wish I could take my dog to this!!! This should be more common😭😭
Life jacket for 2 foot of water lol
That's too long for me
zomg this looks wonderful. You just made my day.
Thanks OP! Pure fun for doggos and for hoomans to watch!
OH SHIT IT’S MY HOMETOWN ON THE FRONT PAGE

GO IDAHO
love that there is a lifeguard on duty lol
This is very soothing, I need this as a screensaver or something...am I old for referencing a 'screen saver'? 🤦
im going to need a longer video
We dont deserve dogs
This video is very therapeutic.
Now *this* is chaos I can roll with
SMH. Why the hell are dogs wearing life preservers in a kiddy pool?
Wait... is this Ross Park Aquatic Complex in Pocatello ?
Is this Splash Montana in Missoula?
15 second puppy video: goofy dragon
87 second puppy video: cool dragon
this is what u see when u get to heaven
I'm going to save this video to watch when I'm having a sad moment.   So much happiness!  So many wagging tails!  Thanks for sharing 😁
Look at all of the sweet babies!
is the chlorine treatment still in the water? does it bother the good little boyes?
This is the scene right before a cataclysmic asteroid enters the atmosphere, that’s how tranquil this moment is.
Something about fucking with Reddit?
For my friends in Southern California, there's a lake based event for dogs on Sept 7th and 14th for small dogs and Sept 8th and 15th for large dogs in Yucaipa, CA!
1:16?!? What is this!! Sir I expect a 5 minute version next year!!
I've got a wimpy dog that doesn't like walking an wet grass.
(future post)

Reddit was mad last year when the puppy pool party video I posted was only a minute. It's been 365 days and I present: splash dance 2020, a much longer video.
OP where is this?
Can’t wait for the final installment of this. I hear a rumor it’s runtime is 3 whole minutes.
puppy
We did the same thing today at the park I work at!
Hold on is this ross park??
Not going to lie, I wish that I was a dog one day per year.
I got to do this with many of my shelter pups at local YMCA last week. It was awesome!
I wish my area had something like this!!! My water pup would love it!
This makes me so happy!
I like how the bulldog has a life jacket on cause bulldogs can't swim well
This is what my heaven looks like
Thank you, O.p! You're an awesome human.
Check out those two dogs at the beginning! 

I loved them so much I made a gif.

[https://media.giphy.com/media/J4IoXCPkQArDENe7y7/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/J4IoXCPkQArDENe7y7/giphy.gif)
I love their little life jackets...definitley needed in that super deep pool
Magnificent! So many black labs too, represent!
Stream it next year!
My favorite part is that the dogs have a lifeguard
What an amazing idea, too bad my pup is an introverted teen who hates water and would get too anxious for things like this, but I love 'em all the same
This is the only place I ever want to be.
Our community pool does this too, including with the donation to the local rescue. In fact, at first I thought this WAS my community pool! LOL
12 hour live stream confirmed.
My cable has a few channels where it’s a fish tank Or burning log that just loops, this needs to be that
My dog would like to know why he wasn’t invited FYI
Is this Ross Park in Pocatello, Idaho?
That's more like it!!
*Everybody liked that
Dogs are so pure.
Now this is quality content
is this in Idaho?
Where is this heaven on earth?
Reddit's mad at everything all the time. Now you just gave candy to the kid throwing a fit.

The doggos are super cute tho.
This video needs to be longer!
upvote or die
/u/vredditshare
This is the best idea I’ve heard in years
That Life Guard needs to be fired! GEEZ! I didnt hear her blow her whistle one time! NO RUNNING AT THE POOL!
Wow look like something from movie set
Where's the 10 hour version?
I wish I had the money to build one of these for all year round just for doggos.
God I wish that were me
OP this needs to be longer
This is the most relevant thing I’ve ever seen on Reddit. Thanks.
We went to our local waterpark this year and did it.  Had no idea about this and it was so much fun.
I love how dogs do the shake to dry off...while standing in water.
10/10 would watch this over humans in a pool any day of the week.
Happy dogs!!!!
All those tails up: so much fun!
Needs to be longer
still..
Only a 1:17? What the frick?
Next year let's go for a 10min video!
This is what I live for
😍😍😍
Vegas?
is this after labor day when they drain the pool?
Way to short.
Id be sitting in the middle tossing the ball
where was this ;-;
It’s still not long enough.
We’ve been waiting for this moment to come
If they tested that pool it would be full of human pee. Dogs don't shit or piss where they sleep eat or where play in water is involved. Man made water ie. Pools.
Still not long enough.
Wow, and now you have guaranteed internet points and gold every year
Had kinda crummy day...but this video is making it better
I’m mad that this video won’t play
Wow this is awesome! Where is this at?
both videos are smooth, what did you use to take video?
Is this in the Okanagan?
Wow.. this really does make me feel happy.
That looks like the East Bay lol
Thank you for this.
That’s at the Allen Witt Park in Fairfield, CA! My wife and I take our kiddo to swim lessons and saw them setting it up. Looked fun!
THIS IS GORGEOUS!!!!!
Love watching all of them having fun, great ideaa
Booooooo only 1min 16sec
Talk about Labrador Sea. There were so many cute Labs out there.
Omg is this the Haynes pool in RR? I wanted to go but my car broke down. My boy Marshmello is crazy for water!! ❤️❤️
I could watch this all day. This needs to be a livestream
that's a lot of well-behaved pups.
This just made my night a lot better, thank you.
Where is this
I love it! I wish a place near me did this!
I was sad; now I'm smiling :)
I would be concerned about having some dogs fight each other tho. It looks like they are having such a blast, but there has to have been at least one who growled at everyone else.
Could you point out your dog?  I don't see one in a Superman bandana.  I don't know why, exactly, but I am super curious!
Is this done by freedom service dogs?
Pupper pool party 2: the woofening
Look at all those happy doggos!!! Yayyy!
My local pool had one of these at the end of the year. My dog took a big wet shit in the water and we had to leave soon after.
Is this Ross park in Pocatello, Idaho?
There are a disproportionate number of black labs.
This is Pocatello Idaho.
This is EXACTLY the kind of content I'm looking for. Thank you for sharing!
They pee in the pool less than people. Makes ya think
I know where this water park is! Been forever since I’ve been there!
I love that there is a life guard.
Where is this!!! I need to go!!!! Just watching this video made me smile.
Something about this gif is so relaxing and calming
Welcome to splashtopia.
LOLOL too funny. My dog would have loved this.
This. Is. Spectacular!

One of the state parks in my area does this too. It's a swimming lagoon so it gets deep enough for dogs to swim. I've seen dogs out there swimming totally ignoring their owners when they are calling them in to leave! Cracks me up!
I'd love to be a life guard at a puppy pool!
Where is this held?
I love this! Everyone is having such a good time! We should all try and be like these pups!
I went to one of these with my dogs a few years ago. One ran straight into the pool and shit in the water... I got a few dirty looks as I figured out how the hell to pick up poop off the bottom of the pool. Thank you poor pool staff boy who had to fish it out!
You done good kid
This is the best thing I saw this week... thank you.  
But such a pity it's just for a limited time?
Why was I not invited!!!!
That one wiener dog wearing a safety vest
Where is your pool?
I used to spend every summer at Ross Park!
Not one of them peed in the pool. 😂
If only I could be there. Thats dog heaven.
i know this water park and i'm so mad i missed out on this
This is the best thing I've ever seen on the internet
My 2 rottweilers and 1 rottweiler-german shepherd mix wouldn't go in at all. They're way scared of water. But will be playing ball as fuuuuck with others
V cute :) a lot of big dogs, tho. Missing the tinies ❤️
Where is this?!
This... does put a smile on my face.
*Everyone liked that*
O
That’s a lot of happy tails
I hope they used the slide!
We had one today and I forgot :( but there's another one on the 21st!! And I just registered me and my pup!
Puppers are going to sleep good tonight!
Yeah this is awesome, thank you!
Doggy poolazza we have these every year here. They have bikini  contest (for dogs) photo booths , eating contest  and best personality.  I have a couple pictures of the one we went to before my gorda left me .
Lifeguard is having the time of their life watching cute dogs play around

We don't deserve dogs.
If aliens invade and want to find new pets. Dogs will win. I could never have that much fun in a pool.
Great job! Next year I need an hour of this, please.
They also do this in Camp Hill, PA at the pool there if anyone is interested.
 I bet not one single dog peed in the pool.
Now next year you need to film with a VR 360° camera mounted on the playset in the center.
Awww antisocial like the owners(jk)
LOOK AT ALL THE BORK BORK NOM NOMS!!
This is what heaven looks like.
You might have to live stream it next year to top this year
is this what doggy heaven looks like?
That's it!  Now, I have to make this in the back yard!
You've made my day, thank you x
How do they make sure the doggies don't poop or pee in the water?
When i die i wouldnt mind ending up here
OMG!
Ross Park, eh?
Seriously? only 1 minute? You can do better than that OP.
Videos you can smell
I think....labs like the water...
Seriously, you didn't film in 360°? /s
This video is my actual dream :D
lol my beagle would hate this SO MUCH

she thinks she's people and completely hates other dogs. she never gets mad at them or tries to nip at them she just utterly hates them invading her personal space and tries to hide as much as possible

100 unleashed excited lick-and-sniff monsters

she'd never forgive me for bringing her to this nightmare :D
The lack of other people filming is refreshing aswell.
It’s still too short!!
This made me so happy :)
This is glorious!
That's my dog in there... wait, Idaho?

What are the odds that one of those dogs looks all but identical to mine lol
Never thought I'd see Ross park on the front page of Reddit or poky for that matter!
Black labs and water, oh what a match!
Thanks fren!
Pugs have left the chatroom.

This is in Kearns Utah?
Looks they are having fun
It definitely looks like all the dogs are having fun, but is there no real worry that fighting will happen in situations like these?
Holy shit is this in Kanab, Utah? Asking cause I went last summer and it looks so similar
Officially requesting a poolside mechanical ball launcher for next year's party.
Wait, there's life guard too !!
I love that my first thought was, oh I hope that the chlorine isn't too harmful for the doggies, and then was like, why do I never wonder that about myself? lol
Is this in Oxford, OH? I had some friend ms that pester very similar images today.
The cherry on top will be a hooman joining in also
That’s awesome! And I love how their is still a lifeguard up there... guarding the pups lives
Is that cook creek pool
I see a poop in the water
Is this the Ross Park Pool? Wow, flood of nostalgia.
I LOVE IT
I LOVE IT
I LOVE IT
