U better have got a bunnings snag while u were there
\*Update\* the owner (who is a little confused about what reddit is)  is EXTREMELY overjoyed that you all love his pup. He does not currently have wifi but I am updating him on the post. Thank you all :)
You can have all the balls in the whole world
Every night, when I got into bed, I would play fetch with my dog. And every morning I would wake up and the ball would be right next to my pillow where he had left it after I had finally falling asleep. He passed on almost two years ago but I still have that ball in my night stand.
Lowest prices really are just the beginning 
You gotta buy the entire store, no other way.

edit: I have a little subreddit of my regular art if you want to browse around.  r/AnthonyChristopherArt . It's not exactly cute though. 
Australian pupper detected.
Omg YES! 

We will get you 28 more balls. 13 rope toys. 33 bones to chew and 7 different types of training treats.

"Where cute puppies are just the beginning!"
We can take puppies inside Bunnings?!!!
Take all the balls. Take everything, sweet lil pup.
I think we all know he‚Äôs only looking cute so he can get his hands on your Bunnings snag
He/she could have all of them, all the balls

Whew Im glad Ive been responsible enough to put off getting a pup till Im more financially stable, ‚Äòcause I surely intend to spoil the heck out of whatever lovely nugget I get
Does this pup have an instagram??
You ever see a puppy so cute, you burst into tears? I'm a grown man, what the eff...

You can take the dog to Bunnings?!?!
I work at Bunnings. I wish all my customers were as cute as this doggo
Best thing that I have encountered ALL DAY was this post. 
Oh, c'mon! How can anyone deny that sweet face a new ball?
Swear if you didn't give him a whole case I'm starting a go fund me and that pupper is getting the whole damn petstore

Cute pitty anyway.
[deleted]

AWWWE he looks just like my G√ºnther (a Blue Neapolitan Mastiff) when he was a pup, my heart üíó 
Yes. A million times, yes. 
Good lord. That‚Äôs it, no point going on. I have seen the cutest thing life has to offer.
I would pour my entire life savings into buying this dog more tennis balls
you better give him/her 20 bags of goddamn balls!!!
You can have whatever you want, little pupper.
I feel like if I was a parent and my kid asked "can I get another toy" Id be able to say not this time, but if a puppy could ask I'd be so broke.
Oh that cutie would get all the tennis balls they wanted in my store!
lowest prices are just the beginning
I'm in love!!! üòç
This is the only thing helping me deal with the AFL LOSS today. 
sweet
OMFG!!!! Holly fuck 
He‚Äôs the goodest boi ever!!!!
This is so wholesome 
Awe you better have gotten him another ball üòç
Perfection 
That little cutie can have whatever it wants! You must give the pup lots of treats and snuggles.
That is the happiest pup I‚Äôve ever seen

I can not upvote anything as hard as I just did this!
His tung is soooo perfect
Yes..yes you can. Take all my coins too. I love you baby. üò≠‚ù§
For you? Absolutely!
 

Better make it two
This is what I imagine my dog looked like as a puppy. I adopted him from the shelter, 3 years ago so I never got to see him as a baby.
Love it when people down vote when they have zero personal time with one. It‚Äôs the owner idiots not the dogs. 

This is so cute but god i hate when people put their pets in shopping carts. 
he is so HAPPY! lol cute pup
Hardware store. Maybe the good boy had a bad moment.  New door knob?  Drywall? Flooring? 
Bunnings sells puppers now?!! brb
Pitbulls to the top!
Why would you bring a puppy into the hardware store? 
Sure thing buddy!
What a cute dog!
its a new ball, or your work boots üêæ
Thank you for reminding me to buy my dog another ball. The last one has been missing for months.

‚ÄúEverything the light touches is yours‚Äù this good baby deserves the world 
Think they'll have a similar one in that model? I'm in the market for a pupper
‚Äú Son, those are doorhandles. Not balls.‚Äù
I uttered a gutteral, ancient sound of love, from my belly. 
Da little floofy boy!!

On that adorable note, remember that retail workers are not responsible for sanitizing the shopping carts.  Bring your own wipes.

(Btw I never could shop properly in Bunnings if I bring my dog with me. Mr centre of attention)
I would go broke buying everything for that pup

Unless you're gonna chuck a bunno's snag like a boomerang for him, I don't think that good boy is gonna find any balls there.
Very Nice
Damn that‚Äôs a cute dog
Yes. Yes we can. I‚Äôll buy you the entire fucking store.
Stop. This pup is too cute. I can‚Äôt handle it
Adorable 
Oh look so sweet, ,, what kind of dog?
What‚Äôs the breed of this cutie 
I buy lengths of rope for my boy at the hardware store and tie them in knots for him to tug, fetch, and chew on. Now when we go he drags me right to that aisle!
i want him RIGHT NOW
Get it a ball and not what looks like a doorknob or shower head. 
Oh dat pit baby with the smiles!!  
Beautiful!
So cute
woof!
He is So Cute 
Give him whatever he wants. 
Or, even better, a snag on the way out! 
That tongue!
No balls at Lowe‚Äôs 

Sorry
The most amazing part of this post is all of the Australians in the comments going apeshit because of Bunnings lmao. That's what the lowest price will do to people.
Just one? Please? You already took two of mine
Pipples have the best doggy smiles. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Awwwww
And yess we can!!!
Give him all the balls!
Awww
Awwww what a cute sprinkler head chewer-offer!  Seriously...adorable 
Good luck keeping that pup with an intact ball. My boy that looked just like this when young will get a heavy duty toy and play with it for 5 minutes before it is gone
The most beautiful dog in the whole world
Heck yeah you can!
This was the best post to open Reddit to. Thank you kind sir/madam.

To cute for words!!

Dogs are so simple, all they want is your time.

Oh you sweet baby!
Fuck yes Bunnings 
DANG IT I‚Äôm never at the right Bunnings at the right time, I have never seen a pupper there in my life, let alone a freaking adorable blue tiny one üò©
With that face the answer is always "yes".
Wow, maybe the cutest puppy I've ever seen.
Yes you may.
I just wanna smash the like button. This is too cute üòç
Hell frickin yeah you can!
_BUNNINGS WAREHOUSE_
Why do I never come across cute puppas when I visit Bunnings? :(
Oh, c'mon! How can anyone deny that sweet face a new ball?
.......(puts ten balls in cart.......
Every 3-6 months I have a dream about a gorgeous little blue pibble pup falling into my lap (figuratively), and my SO says we can keep her. She's always a she and usually looks a little different each time, but we don't have the room for a second dog so it's uncharacteristic for him to say it's okay to keep her. The amount of love I instantly feel for this little baby is overwhelming. I can't wait for the day I can make that dream come true. 
There is nothing more adorable than a pupper with a ball! Reward this goodin' with a glow in the dark ball! 
You can have whatever you want with that smile, puppers!!!
This pic was the perfect way to start my day. 
i had no idea bunnings let you take your dog inside. this changes everything
üò≠üò≠
Upvoted for Bunnings 
After buying all the balls, OP is now broke, hence the near-empty cart.
Wow I am amazed. Apart from my dog being a lot bigger now as she's nearly 2, this pup looks exactly the same as mine! The white chest, little white parts on the toes, blue everywhere else. 
This takes me back about 3 and a half years. That little guy is the spitting image of my pretty girl Ashes.
Taking the dogs to get the snags eh?
No we ca.... okay okay, we can get another ball. Oh and some treats too. 
GET HIM ANOTHER FUCKING BALL!!! 
More importantly, did puppers get a Bunnings snag on the way out?
Either an Aussie or a kiwi :p
Get this man a fuckin' snag!
Bunnings don't sell balls.
Lowest prices are just the beginning 
U can have every single ball ever 
do they sell dog toys at places like this?
Aww...yah cutie Patoutie you can't get a million more balls, just being so cute and happy!
He stole my heart away
Why do I love puppies but hate little kids? WTF brain it‚Äôs your own species!
I want one
THAT SMILE
Cute pupper
What a beautiful puppy!!! You are lucky to have him!!
A puppy I can deal with. It's a pit bull on a heavy chain at home depot that gives me pause.  Why do they even let them in the store
Is that a pitty
You can have all the balls! 
Yes! And I'll up you one.. how about a ball... on a rope!
You can have a 100 more. A thousand more. 
Looks like my pup Freya at that age. Take many pics. They grow up waaaay too fast. I highly recommend KONG balls. They're the only ones I've found that are even remotely Pibbie "proof", as if such a thing is even truly possible, and most Pibs love tug-o-war, so a good thick rope is always hand too. Happy Shopping! 
What breed is the lil guy? He‚Äôs so cute!
No.  Go to your room.  -nobody ever 
Pit bull?
I honestly can‚Äôt even handle how cute this is. I feel like my head is going to self destruct. 
I didn't know I could bring my dogs to Bunnings
Please tell me you got him another ball!
When it grows older it will be a dangerous creature that will want to bite and could be mortal. So it is not cute at all
Uh, this is a hardware store. No balls. Its ballless.
I see that there is a lot of pitbull content on the front page. Do most people like pitbulls and is this why this happens, or could there be brigading? I really dislike this breed of dog and likely the owners.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to, but I can't find this cute when I heard about the frequency and number of injuries this breed and crossbreeds has.

&#x200B;
LOL Of course!
Cute Picture 
If that pup,doesn't get anything he/she wants, there'll be hell to pay from the Internet!
no but I will take one puppy,   this cutie here,   for two balls
He can have them all!
Please post more photos 
Doorknob shopping
Sadly, I don't think Bunnings sells balls. My local one, though, has a Petbarn on the other end of the carpark.
is that a blue great dane, so cute, i got one couple weeks ago and they are the best 
What. A. Goober! :)
Aww! He is so cute
In the case of my dog, it's more like, "can we get 8,162 balls?"
That‚Äôs so cute!!
They sell balls at the home improvement store?
YESSS
What! My tiny puppy had an injury and on the way home from the vet we tried to pop into Bunnings and the doorman said we couldn‚Äôt bring Jakey in. I wonder if the rules have changed or Parafield isnt pet friendly 
I really said awww when I see him..
OP if you didn't get a ball...you should be ashamed of yourself!
soft
One of the guys at work has the slightly older version of this pup. She‚Äôs a terror, but so cute!
I miss Bunnings... Hello from Thailand!
Nope only g‚Äôs
Thank you kind stranger who gave me gold :)
Be still my heart. This is what I imagine my pitty looked like as a puppy üíú
You leget dont want two. We just got two and they are a lot of work.
He doesn‚Äôt want a ball, he wants the sausage sandwich‚Äôs that they‚Äôre selling in the car park 
Absolutely 
Great name !! That smile will light up your darkest days 
BACOOOOON

Look guys, I'm all for your happiness, but if people don't stop posting their adorable staffy-puppy-in-Bunnings-trolley pics I'm afraid I'm going to have to get myself a staffy... just in case I ever need to go to Bunnings. As it stands, my life appears incomplete

Dogs don't go in carts or even stores unless they're service dogs or it's PetSmart. Happy looking puppy though.
The new dogs in trolley rule is absolute garbage.
