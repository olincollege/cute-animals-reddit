She‚Äôs seen the world and was not impressed with it.
You can tell this cat has seen some stuff
I‚Äôm gettin too old for this s‚Äî-
So cranky! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
repost because first had a catption
‚ÄúRemind me why I haven‚Äôt killed you yet‚Äù
''Not this again''
Life sucks and then you die.
She is not impressed...
She was pissed off bc you told the world her real age
How does everyone‚Äôs fuckin cats live so long? I‚Äôve lost 3 cats now all under 5 to the most unlucky bullshit...
Not amused after 17 hard years.
Life beats us all down I suppose...
/r/restingbitchfacecats should be a thing
The world broke him
17x the hatred.
Yeah me too.
Piss off, Paul. I‚Äôm gonna out live you...
I see s/he has fully embraced the dark side
Aww she/he is so pretty even though he looks a bit mad
Same tbh
Awww still beautiful!
From a ball of love to a ball of hate.
Get. Off. My. Lawn.
Life hits hard
Still adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
She is so fucking done with life it‚Äôs almost saddening
New grumpy cat
Eeek. Seriously creepy look there at the end! I can concur life does that to us.
Youthful wonder and hopeful optimism ... absolutely tired of everyone's shit.
Happy and hopeful to angry and done with the world.
"If cats could shake their heads at us" look
I love him/her <3
She/he looks amazing for 17! My girl is also a brown tabby and she‚Äôs 21 years young, although her kidneys aren‚Äôt being nice to her :(
I could off by a mile here, but having recent experience with cats who were hiding some form of pain, this cat sort of looks to me like he's past that point of comfortably hiding discomfort. I could be wrong but if you haven't already, definitely take him to the vet.

Congrats on the 17 years! That's awesome. I have my oldest cat in my lap, she's 15 and still healthy and fast and generally amazing. I feel really lucky. My youngest cat is not quite 10 but unfortunately has some sort of nerve condition and is now on continuous medicine to walk. It's weird having two cats senior status, it can be nerve wracking.
Looks like she has seen some stuff back in the day.
That's a "leave me the fuck alone" face.
‚ÄúLife. Don‚Äôt talk to me about life.‚Äù
He/she looks world weary
17 years angrier haha :)
that cat is over your shit
Suppose he‚Äôs aloud to be grumpy now
Damm, depression hit hard
Done with life. Relatable.
Why do you have to show my baby pictures whenever we have company, Dave?
Damn your cat is fucking old
Existing: how one learns to hate.
He looks like he is more wise and disgusted with the world
*‚Äùcuteness to murder by stare‚Äù*
Before picture:  Looks so hopeful.   
After: Has seen some shit, realized things are hopeless, and now is just pissed off at the world.
That cat has assessed its life and wondered where it went so wrong. It started out with high hopes and the world at its feet, and now...

It is a kitty that needs lots of cuddles. üíñ
"Move that shit out of my face before I cram it up your ass, Dave."
This is what growing up really looks like
17 years of dealing with OP's shit.
She‚Äôs mad because she asked for time off and had to come in anyway.
Ruff life.
Yes!
Looks pretty young for a 17 year old.
My sweet 19 years old girl had the same typical Grumpy Old Kitty face. I miss her so much.
Wow I wish I looked that good 17 years later adorable kitty and absolutely cat.
r/FromKittenToCat would appreciate this.
That cat seen some shit in its 17 years
hahahaha  that is the best thing I've seen al day!
Hi Kitty!
/r/angrycatpics
The cutest little Curmudgeon
She looked sad, even as a kitten.
He's tired of your shit OP.
That genuinely gave me a belly laugh. Thank you for that. I needed it today.
He became a lion.
F-ING PISSED
Lmao that‚Äôs brilliant.
Sick of your shit right now
The cat's face is r/youseeingthisshit
That cat's seen some shit...
You've clearly crushed it's poor little soul.
That expression rivals Grumpy Cat's.

Press F to pay respects.
"It's been 17 years Brenda, quit your shit!"
hahaha just like me
Thats the look of a cat who knows what phones are and is tired of wearing bread.
Poor kitty needs you to just cut the frogshit already
Wh-what HAPPENED to you, man?! It's the Suits isn't it? It's the MAN, holding you DOWN bro... You gotta get OUT from UNDER it...
I'd be angry to live past my expiration date as well.
‚ÄúStill sick of your shit‚Äù
This made me audibly laugh out loud...congrats you‚Äôve surpassed the snort! ü•á
That's the face of a cat that has seen a lot of shit.
"ive spent 17 years trying to kill you... why are you not dead yet?"
I relate to this cat.
All that and a bag of chips.
We are not amused.
The old guy's white maw is beautiful
Cutie kitty is now grumpsy kitty
Lmao. She has no time for your shenanigans
Look Karen I've had enough of your shit
Tired of your shit karen
cat: "I'm too old for this shit"
Cat: ‚ÄúEvery day with some new bullshit...üòë‚Äù
I'm sorry to inform you but she developed a case of resting bitch face. There's no cure, but there are a few things that can help including giving her treats and pets. Other than that I suggest no belly rubs and no petting of toe beans unless it is needed.
17 years and tired of your shit
17 YEARS LATER AND STILL SICK OF YOUR SHIT KAREN!!   Hahahaha no but seriously still so cute ü•∞ üòò
Susan... I've had enough of your shit.
Life does that to ya
not amused üòÇ
And still beautiful. Give that love a pet for us!
Jaded... so so jaded.

To be a kitten again...
Love that, "why am I not dead yet" look
maybe it was not a good idea to wrap the kitty.
She took the red pill!
We are getting older, and we are not amused.
She looks like an angry teenager after their parent's showed everyone their baby pictures.
I have one just like her. Mackerel tabby?
17 years later... Fed up with hoomans
More like r/unexpected
Lol exactly like a wife after 17 years of marriage ü§£
aww you loved him so much you got it taxidermied
/r/AirplaneEars would love it
hahahaha!!!!
She looks fed up with life
I feel like the cat is annoyed. I mean, throw back Thursday is so over used Deborah.
Even tho she looks like she might kill you, I think  she's probably cuddly behind that angry face
Goddamit Kevin!
What on earth have you been doing to that nice kitten for 17 years???
I love her so much, and we‚Äôve just met, wow.
Life is tough...the Toughest!
Plotting to smash all your camera equipment when you go out me thinks.
That cat has seen some shit.
Grumpy cat 2.0?
"Are we gonna do this every year?"
She looks a little grumpier.
To a long healthy life ! :)
she's  still mad about that  thing you did 15 years ago.
Actually "aawww" on this one
A lot of hatred can be born in that time.
Still cute tho

Your cat is suitably grumpy
First pic:  innocent in the ways of the world.

Real life:  has seen some shit.
"I told you not to show them that"

^^^"...prick"
Laughed our loud, loved it
cats older then me :o
This cat gives absolutely no fucks.

"Getting real sick of your shit, Karen"
You Kids get off my lawn.
I'll just wait until you're asleep....
The cat is so done
Still mad.
That made me ‚ÄúHEH‚Äù out loud in a crowded room
Kitty having existential crisis
Somebody should recreate same with an adorable little one/surly teen.
The thousand yard stare.
What a cutie. She looks amazing for 17.
I didn't realize that cats could capture my exact emotional state from childhood to now.
Me: Awww, how cute! 

Cat: All must die...
Just like my wedding photo cut to today...
Life is rough buddy. You made it through
I am not amused -Cat
I've had enough of your shit Karen...
I‚Äôm so fucking over your bullshit, Karen.
Why do you bring up my kitten pictures Dave? I am not cute and fluffy, I am killer cat supreme! Now give scritches, see how fluffy and cute I am, scritches are the best.
Before: please pet me

After: touch me and you die
Like when my dad tells one of the stories about toddler me for the 78th time.
17 years of dealing with your shit.
Haha she is so done with everyone's shit.
Kitten..... Grumpy
Okay why can I relate to a cat so much?
With age comes disillusionment ü§£ü§£ beautiful cat.
Me.
"BACK OFF ILL TAKE YOU OOOONN"
Think your cat is sick of your shit, lol.
She looks angry!
I love old cats! My cat is 18, but I only adopted her last year. They can be so sweet.
üòªüòª
DDSS.
This is like me on the outside vs me on the inside üòÇ
Khajit has seen many things.
for goodness sake hooman i'm 17.. sheesh
She‚Äôs aged well.
Hahaha that cat has seen too much!
"End it, just end it now."
‚ÄúHey look, it‚Äôs a picture of when I first adopted you... You look so cute and happy... Where does the time go?‚Äù
Stoked!
Grumpy Cat Jr. (Sr.?)
This cat is every single adult that has dealt with shit in life. This cat is my spirit animal.
Grumpy cat is reborn!
your cat is older than me :/
Un.im.pressed
It's like people avatars(profile pics) and then them in real life.
You and me both
Handsome cat
That look tho...
And still the same
Sums life up pretty well...
Still has 9 lives but lost a few fucks along the way it seems.
Grumpy cat
Check out my account please I'm new
This cat is very good at expressing how done with your shit he is lmfao
‚ÄúI am not amused!‚Äù  Lol so cute!!
I've had Miss Pearl for 3 years... Yeah, same fur, same expressions.
That cat is 100% sick of the owners bullshit.
She seems a little upset to be in camera
Me too buddy, me too
I swear cats look more pissed as they grow older.
I sense a trend...
I can vouch. I, too, hate life.
Accurate
Cats are so much cooler than us that most times we don't know how to handle it. So we goo gaa tweet them, and they look at us like . . .
Legit thought that was an Abercrombie bag at first. Need coffee.
Fuckin‚Äô thousand yard stare right there.
Awwwwwzzzzzz
A curmudgeon! Nice!
Such a serious face
Cat gives zero F's being young or old.
That cat looks like he's had enough of your shit.
That tail down, the forward hunch, and the eyes on that face gives me the impression that you haven't fed that cat in 17 years...

...i mean really, just look at it.     :)
I would've back away immediately
He/she looks completely unimpressed.
Damn that cat is older than me
[Where did the years go?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6cBk0T_ioQ)
Grumpy cats bring me great joy
That's a great photo for 17 years...
Kitties thoughts on this post ...

‚ÄúGive me food. I need a nap.‚Äù
I wanna say poor cat :/ life is tough... or is that just what looking old looks like?
What kids think adult life is like vs kids when they find out what it‚Äôs like
She's seen some shyt
[OP taught well](https://giphy.com/gifs/how-i-met-your-mother-NQpIq2vYsTxG8)
Reddit is making me want a cat... or three
The world will do that to u
She has had ENOUGH of you and your camera and the internet.
That cat has grown to be..... MENACING!!!!
Teenagers these days
Looks like she‚Äôs been ridden hard and put away wet
She‚Äôs tired of seeing you doing stupid stuff
Pedo smile activated
You have clearly never been forgiven for that ribbon...
Wow he looks really good for 17!
She has aged very gracefully. ‚ù§üòäüê∫
"You promised to never show that to anyone again, hooman..."

Life in a nutshell
Reality was disappointing...
The look of 17 years of sitting around the house
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Same.
Still the same pretty kitty ‚ù§Ô∏è You are very lucky.
Cats always looks a little meaner as they get older. But they certainly don‚Äôt act meaner.
Kitty looks mad!
"Seriously dude...it's been 17 years...stop taking pictures of me..."
Fucking STOP KAREN!
/u/vredditshare
Someone had a piece of grumpy pie...
Mellow kitty. üò∫
That sums up life.
She got a whole lot less happier
Aww super cute! I am thinking of getting a new kitten now. I recently lost my Maine coon cat if 18 years.
She looks pissed to still be alive.
freshman year vs. senior year
"If only you've seen what I've seeing while watching windows."
Guess life beat that cat down
I just woke up and wasn't prepared for that. It actually startled me a bit. :( still so cute though.
Ah where did the years all go by? Spongebob

This looks a lot like a before retail/food service and after retail/food service transition
My 19 year old kitty can relate üò©
GRUMPY CAT RISES AGAIN!!!
Me too, Cat. Me too.
From curiosity to complete disgust.
Your cat is going to smother you in your sleep for this.
‚ÄúI will end you‚Äù
For some reason I think of Batman
u/VredditDownloader
Hooman, I know where you sleep. I'm going to kill you.
After I nap
New grumpy cat
I've...seen things... You people wouldn't believe.
Awwww, she looks pissed! Very healthy for 17 years old, but still very pissed.
She's perfect.
Someone is in a mood!
This made me laugh way to hard.

My life fuckin sucks. Thanks for the laugh.
This puss has seen some shit.
Leave me the fuck alone, Karen.
"Yes, I get it. I'm ***OLD***. Can we put the baby pictures away now?"
Spirit broken
Seventeen years, omg, wow.

Still bitter about that bag
It's like her only thought is,  'I'm not impressed.'

Such a sweet girl!
Grumpy cat would be proud.

Actually he wouldn't.
Grumpy old lady haha
I spit sprite out my nose. 
That cat clearly is not impressed.

She didn‚Äôt look real thrilled as a kitten.
Hahaha life must have disappointed her

This is what I imagined Church looked like in Pet Semetary. 


Pro Tip: dont try to resurrect it if it dies.
Her timid expression became quite serious over 17 years.
She looks.....not impressed with her 17 years.
That cat is fed up with all matters of shit
THIS MAKES ME SO UNREASONABLY HAPPY YEEEEEEEEEEEEE

That cat has seen some shit lol
Life happens.

A lot can happen in 17 years. Probably too much.
Are those dab rigs I see in the background?
‚Äú17 years later I‚Äôm rude as Jude‚Äù
Oh whos a mr or mrs gwumpie gwumps???
I love this look. Omgosh what a cool cat
Oh look, me as a cat.
17 Years Ago: "Mew!"

Eventually, everyone turns into a grumpy old person... everyone.
What a sweetie
That cats seen some shit üòÇ
"Life gets better! Just kidding, you're going to get old, sick, cranky and then die."
Oh she MAD mad

But why is this actually me
Innocent to jaded.
This is literally me in front of teachers then me in front of my friends.
Grumpy old man
I‚Äôd be depressed and angry if I was an old cat with aches and pains too.
Oh that come of shame as a kitten, getting in to trouble since 2002

He's seen all the world wars
As jaded as I am
Still pissed about being wrapped up as a gift I see.
>She has been for years.
This is a mood.
It's like me now vs my first-day employee ID pic.
I only got a year with my best fur baby.   What I would give to have 17.   That‚Äôs a blessing.

LOL so hard woke my cat, thanks OP
That cat has seem some things.
17 years of plotting to kill you... :O
Posting twice to increase karma I see, you‚Äôve been taught well. *(mischievous laughter)*
You took a happy and hopeful kitten and turned him into a grumpy old man who's tired of your shit.
Omg.. What HAPPENED??
The twin of our cat Celine. She‚Äôs learnt to come up to the bed and be very vocal about us closing her exit (back door) on very cold nights. Her displeasure and bruised dignity is expressed in a sour look and deep growl.
Me after two kids.
This is what Ron Swanson would look like as a cat.

I think that cat is stuffed. Doesn‚Äôt even flinch.
"You said you would stop showing everyone my baby pictures."
Hahaha, thanks for sharing this and making me smile.
Life can do that to ya.
That cat is sooooooooo done with your shit at the moment
Lot of comments on here about how she's angry or bitter or mean, I just see a kitty that is comfortable with her people, that has the experience and time to think about it all-inclusive deeply (for a cat) and found that you're worth spending time with.... She's beautiful
If I had to live with funny pants over here for 17 years I‚Äôd have the same expression
Out of curiosity, as a new cat owner.. does cats starts showing affection to its owner after all those years or it the same as day one?
Dang he's looking at you like you owe him money.
/r/me_irl
Bah Humbug!!
17 ears later she‚Äôs not shaking so much..just chillin
She's got that, whatever Dave look.
RIP OP

He‚Äôs mad just like you get when your parents share your baby pictures with total strangers
Old baby
I love this!
Reminds me of my Mum's cat Yngwei. He passed away last Christmas holiday after a  year of arthritis and thyroid problems aged 17. Bless his soul he was such a big chongus and loved to hunt when I knew him as a kid, so it was devistating seeing him all thin and creaky after having not been to my mother's in a few years.
Will you like all my pics and texts
Life has not been kind. Not kind at all.
Just a reminder that this girl right here‚Äôs gonna eat you as soon as you die in your apartment
you know you fucked up
17 years of putting up with this kinda shit lol
This cat has seen some shit
She's not having it
she grump
i don't want to entertain all these humans out there ...
That cat has seen shit.
She's angry at you right now. The face says "take that out to my face! That's not me, thats a little cutie head and I'm not"
Behold! The ravages of time!

Before and after life hitting you hard

Someone had been wronged

Is that what marriage looks like after 17 years?
Relatable
It's still pissed that you put it in a bag that one time.
She looks like all of us 17 years later..

From 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm theirs‚Äù
To
*‚Äùoh god.. I‚Äôm theirs?‚Äù*
Scrolled slightly too far on the front page, couldn't honestly tell if this was in r/aww or r/funny
She looks like she's gone from the energetic, virtuous undergraduate excited to save the world to the smug, desiccated assistant professor who missed tenure.
Now Kitty is exhibiting some serious ‚ÄúCatattude‚Äù
NO MORE PICTURES!!
I've watched this so many times and her face never fails to make me laugh
