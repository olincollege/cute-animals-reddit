That dog is shockingly calm. He looks so happy!
Someone please edit out the glider and harness so it looks like he actually flies on the dog!
it took 5 years for my dog not to freak out on car rides and he still needs an open window to stay calm. this good boy is zen af.
Does he have trouble landing with the dog in between his legs?
Appa YIp Yip!
How did you not use the song from The Never Ending Story?
It‚Äôs a cloud it‚Äôs a dragon no it‚Äôs a flying Doggo
That dog looks majestic as fuck
Sorry but this video needs a different soundtrack... FTFY

https://gfycat.com/pleasinggrandchimpanzee
I just have a minor question/concern. How does the landing work with the dog touching down first?
I would like to see the take off. Is the pup nervous? Excited to go or like a bath? It sucks until the soapy massage begins? He/she/Falcore looks pretty happy.
Almost seems like he's done this a few times already...
I couldn‚Äôt forgive myself if my dog broke out of that harness
wonder how he lands safely without running dog into ground
My dog is terrified of the thunder jacket we bought her today‚Ä¶.to help her storm anxiety. 

And then there‚Äôs this motherfucker
Can we talk about the musical choice? Why isn‚Äôt it the never ending story theme song??
The other dogs go on walks.
This dog flies.
If that dog had pants on I bet he‚Äôd shit‚Äôem.
Doggo would probably prefer to be wearing some goggles doing this.
Feels like this unnecessarily puts your dog at risk.
Dats a good boi
How the fuck does reddit, the land of moral superiority, upvote this to top of front page?
I'll get downvoted to hell for this, but I don't think this is cute. I wouldn't expect someone to take their 4 year old kid up there, don't take an animal either, unless it's a bird. It's just a risk thing.
If you can do this to a dog you should be able to do this with a toddler. Point: Dont do that.
My dogs would hate this. The won‚Äôt even walk near a sewer grate.
That is one smug looking dog.
Does he like it?
I dont know how i feel about taking a dog on a parachute trip, its a dangerous activity and its not like the animal can be prepared for it mentally. I wonder if the dog can even comprehend he is up in the sky or not?
That dog is thinking "those other dogs that stick their heads out of car windows have noooo idea."
This seems messed up to do to a dog
Atreyuuuuuuu!
[deleted]
Poor fucking dog
Wtf? Surely someone else thinks it's weird to send a dog paragliding?
Good thing it‚Äôs his dog and he can do whatever the fuck he wants.
It‚Äôs all good until he gets close enough to the ground for squirrels to be visible
I love samoyeds so much. Magic angels with fur
This isn‚Äôt the good boy‚Äôs first rodeo üòç
How does he land without crushing the dog though?
This doggo has seen more than me in life.
Dog has more balls than me
Curious on how he lands without hurting the pup
That's fucked
The distance I had to scroll to find people questioning why a dog is parachuting..... absurd. Skateboarding dog, great. Surfing dog, awesome. Both dangerous, but also not throwing your flightless dog out of a plane. At least dogs can swim and are flexible enough to handle a wipeout.
He needs goggles.
Putting your life at risk for your own kicks is one thing, but the dogs is a completely different thing my friend
Couldn't even play the *actual* theme song? https://youtu.be/lHytjEj7B9g
Absolutely not
Not fucking cool...
Is dog parachuting a thing people do? How the heck do they get the dog to agree
I love and value my dog too much to bother risking his life for my dangerous hobby/social media video, so don't mean to sound cynical but this is completely stupid
So I guess blind people CAN skydive.
What an awful thing to do to a dog.  Jackass
That poor dog doesn't know what the hell is going on and like many other people have asked in this thread, how did the landing go. You really shouldn't do something like this with a dog
Imma do this with my kitty and hes gonna stick his little claws all the way through my balls until they meet up again in his beans
Dog may be mans‚Äô best friend, but man is not dogs‚Äô best friend.
Yea this is not aww at all OP
NeverEnding story vibe üòÇ
Alexa, play the pilotwings theme song
How does he land without hurting him?
Someone literally saw a flying dog that day, how cool is that.
Going to be a ruff landing
My dog would somehow cause us both to crash and die
People under the dog: ‚ÄúHuh. Why are these rains yellow?‚Äù
‚ÄúFinally, proper air conditioning!‚Äù-the dog, probably
Dog looks high. I mean he is up high, but he looks high while high.
Closest to Appa we'll ever get!
![gif](giphy|mx9fVEF08tyne)
Thus makes me nervous to watch
Dog is unimpressed
How does he land im genuinly curious, like does he drop the doggo shortly before he lands? like a foot above the ground, does he lift the doggo up and does the funny run the gliders do when landing with the doggo? i need answers!
This dog looks like he‚Äôs having the best day of his life
Meanwhile my dog shits herself when she gets her nails trimmed.
I want to know how you are supposed to safely land a dog.
How the FUCK do u hold a selfie stick while hangliding???
How does one go about testing if your dog would panic or not for a skydive? Then how does one convince skydiving associations that he/she won‚Äôt?
If I had one day left with my pup
That polar bear is very chill
I could watch this all day. And Samoyeds are the bestest dogs.
They are the most laid back, happy breed
As a cloud, he is right at home in the sky.
Surely that‚Äôs crue‚Ä¶ wait. He fucking loves it! 

I‚Äôll shut up
Meanwhile, there‚Äôs a dude watching from the ground who is now completely covered in fluffy white dog fur shedding down from the heavens.
‚ÄúYou piece of shit how could you do that to a dog an‚Ä¶ aww lil tongue.‚Äù
                    -me
That fluffly little cloud looks like a dog! Hey, wait...
Idk what you guys are on about. I just see a man surrounded by clouds, and that one suspiciously happy cloud.
That fluffy cloud looks happy.
How is that not scaring that dog shitless?!
This is so stupid, dangerous, and unnecessary.
This is not okay
Reminder why I hate Reddit sometime
I want to see them land. Does the dog know they‚Äôre about to hit the ground and he should start trotting?
I love this. 

I do however feel the need to point two things out:
1. Dogs, when in a harness/sling like that where their paws are not touching the ground and in the air, is a calming thing. That‚Äôs why that floof is so chill. Groomers have a similar set up for dogs that tend to be unruly or difficult to handle. 

2. This harness setup if you look closely, retracts up and in towards the guy‚Äôs chest, so that dog is pulled up for takeoff and landing and in a position that is safe for the dog.
Poor puppy forced to do this shit
Next time get eat muffs for your dog. That must have been hell for him.
Lets unnecessarily hang my dog off of this parachute and take pictures so I can get some attention Because my parents never loved me
Is this animal cruelty
Fuck that guy.  Whether the dog likes it or not, that is a shit thing to do.
Eh this one feels a bit much.
This isn‚Äôt aww. This is stupidity.
Who goes sky diving with their dog that‚Äôs a risky move
No way a dog is cool with this.
Reckless move.
Absolutely no fucking reason to do this with your dog.
Seems cruel to the dog.
No head protection on the dog, wtf! Neat but wtf!
This is incredibly fucking stupid. Fuck this guy.
How is the dog NOT petrified?
seems like an easy way to injure your dog on the landing
I understand that the dog looks like he doesn‚Äôt mind whats going on but why would you want to put your dog in danger like this?
Well I like how people wanna see him flying on the dog my question is how the fuck does he land without hurting his "luck dragon"?
Jesus Christ, poor dog
How do you safely land with out squishing or hurting the dog?
How exactly do you land without harming the dog?
This guy is insane. This is animal cruelty.

Taking an animal that is submissive and has no choice to go on a stupid meanuver with the owner for views and his own dopamine hit.

If this shit went wrong I‚Äôm sure you all wouldn‚Äôt be applauding.
Anyone know how he lands?
The dog doesn't seem to mind, so I guess it's ok.  But I also kinda feel like this is borderline animal cruelty/endangerment.
This feels‚Ä¶ I dunno. Abusive?
Landing from the air is usually quite rough, hope the dog was ok
Y'all know he doped that doggy up first, right? Snowball is way too chill.
The dog being so chill about flying in the goddamn air has me thinking that‚Äôs not the first time they‚Äôve done this together
This is not how the military jumps with dogs. They harness them across their chests. Leaving their legs free for the falling into the ground bit at the end. https://imgur.com/VnGnNXd.jpg
How is he gonna land without hurting that doggo? Thats the real question
Wouldn‚Äôt this make landing much more difficult since you have to worry bout not also breaking the dogs legs
That looks incredibly terrifying for the dog.
idk about this
That helmet is only rated for rocks falling on you, it's not rated to keep you safe in a crash
So how is he going to land without smashing that dog?
Wayyy better than hanging out the car window‚Ä¶
This is cruel.
Falcor!!
Never ending story
**FALKOR! FALLLKORRRR!**
Is the dog survived or injured while landing ? He is literally resting on the dog.
That pup seems incredibly calm, considering what's happening here.
Shouldn‚Äôt the background song should be ‚ÄúThe NeverEnding Story‚Äù by Limhal.
That's a dog that trusts its pack leader, dude will follow him anywhere with utmost confidence.
How‚Äôs he land?
WTH‚Ä¶!!!! This should/must be done with the never-ending story theme!!!!

https://youtu.be/lHytjEj7B9g
Greatest song in the world too super wholesome
Being with his human makes it all okay.
So this is cool and i'm sure hes done it before since the dog looks chill and isn't freaking out. BUT HOW DOES HE LAND SAFELY?
Can someone put the never ending story song to this, like it should be?
"The never ending story" irl.
"you're a little heavy peter!"
No goggles? *tsk tsk*
PHONEY!
This is adorable, but does anyone else wonder how they land with the dog?
I don‚Äôt know how I feel about extreme sports people involving their pets. This dude crashes, and it‚Äôs a hundred times more tragic because he strapped his dog to his crotch.
This seems mean‚Ä¶ like the doggo doesn‚Äôt look angry but I feel like he would be so anxious??
That dog is gonna have a not good time when it lands. Imagine jumping from like 10 feet up, thats what the landings gonna be like
Thanks for the ear worm. Now I can‚Äôt sleep because all I hear is the music as he‚Äôs flying‚Ä¶
When he lands won‚Äôt the pup face most impact ?
Hot take here, but maybe take your own risks? 

Yes I see that the dog is calm, but that is because it is pleasing its owner. If something goes wrong, you made the decision to do this, but the dog had no say in it.
This video makes me anxious üò¨
How is the dog so damn calm
I think it‚Äôs fake. Hear me out. Get a MSFS 2020 clip.  Then, green screen. Use tons of fans on the subjects. Merge the two videos. Viola!
But.. how does he land?
There is no way in hell I‚Äôd be able to do this. I‚Äôm a nervous wreck as is, let alone with my dogs safety
That‚Äôs a never ending adventure and story of a lifetime right there
I can only imagine what's going through the dog's mind as he's gliding in the air.
Breaking news: innocent cloud gets kidnapped by man in parachute, no word of ransom
The trip down may be pleasant but the landing is gonna be pretty ruff.
That dog is high as fuck
No WAY this dog isn‚Äôt sedated so he doesn‚Äôt freak out! Incredible if its not!!
It wasn't enough that he had to take his dog up, but he has to shlep his selfie stick too....
He looked a lot bigger in the first Neverending Story.
üíï
that dog is super chilled and happy - he's enjoying it lol
This looks really fun but Im just wondering how youre supposed to land without crushing your dog
That dog verry lucky
Why tf would they not use the music from The Never Ending Story!!?? You had one job...
This dog has one less item to check off its bucket list than me
Up dog.
How does he land with the dog like that? Seems like the dog would get smooshed
Falkor*
I would play the never ending story song instead.
Atreyu got older and Falkor became travel-size
Falkor*
It‚Äôs like the ultimate car ride
I love how the dog is just calm all throughout. :)
I feel like this guy is French.
Dog has a better life than me I guess. I‚Äôll just go fuck myself üòåüòã
Dog? I just see a man riding a cloud
I love how chill the dog is.üòä
That is so wonderful!
Good Doggo
We found out what the dog doing
when the doggo comes back home I bet he tells the cat neighbour he was so high and flew through the clouds...the cat will be like "dude what kind of catnip did you take? gimme some bro"
How do you land without breaking the dog‚Äôs legs? And how do you train a dog to not freak out in that situation, how would you know wether the dog would like it before their first trip?
How do you present something like this to a dog? Do you just clip him on your harness and 'force' him off a mountain until he gets used to it? Not trying to sound like an ass, but I'm genuinely curious.
Dogs probably like *this is fine*
this is the wholesome shit i need injected into my veins daily
Is this fake maybe. It doesn't look like the ground is coming any closer?
I feel there was a huge miss with not playing the music from the never ending story.
Yip Yip!
Wait... Amazon delivers dogs now????
i don't wanna be a downer but I have some serious concerns about how the landing is going to work
How safe is this for the dog?
This becomes a lot less wholesome when they land
Dog so terrified it looks like a prop
Idiot
They make specific paragliders for dogs that supposedly support up to 2000 pounds
The dog park just was never enough after that day...
How is the doggo so chill with this ?
Thats not fucking cool.
Gotta get that dog some goggles.
Hmmm I don't like this.
Omg. That‚Äôs awesome but I would be worried about the landing
It‚Äôs a *Never Ending Story*
I hope his name is Falkor..
What an awesome dog. Wonder how many times it took for dog to get comfortable or if it was just a badass from the get go.
I can‚Äôt imagine the dog is enjoying itself
This is stupid
I kind of hate this. Stop putting your dog in danger for viral videos
Hmmm... how do you land?
100% this guy doesn't give a shit about his dog, and pretends to be loving just for social media clout. This kind of thing is bag for a dog's anxiety and is super risky.

Fuck this guy in particular.
I'm really not sure how I feel about this one.
So how do you land safely
I am interested in seeing the landing
Never Ending Story?
That must be the best version of ‚Äúhanging your head out of a window‚Äù for dogs
How are they supposed to land in this situation???
Everyone who allowed this should be thrown out of a plane without a parachute, fucking assholes. It's not like the dog has a say in the matter, this makes me lose hope in this fucking humanity, how the fuck is this even possible?
Imagine if the dog just poop mid air lol
This dog obviously seems calm and happy, but who the fuck does this to their dog for the first time?!
This reminds me of the dudes who ride around with their dogs on motorcycles. It‚Äôs cool until something goes wrong.
Honestly I can‚Äôt understand why people do this shit with their dogs just to film it for internet points. I can assure you the dog was never like, ‚Äúplease take me up with you.‚Äù 

I kinda think shit like this is extremely inhumane whatever nobody cares good doge.
How scared was the dog before you jumped
That dog is high as hell
Can we pls be sure puppy isn‚Äôt drugged
Edit: no idea why I‚Äôm being down voted I‚Äôm just worried :( there‚Äôs way too many ‚Äúcute‚Äù animal videos going around on Reddit that seem cute but are actually animals being mistreated‚Ä¶. If the puppy is fine then that‚Äôs wonderful! It‚Äôs an adorable video & the pup is clearly relaxed! I just said can we be sure. If we are, great!
Wish I could downvote 1000 times, considering how dangerous the take off and landing is in these (without a dog) He needs to set his values straight and not think about internet popularity
This isn't 'aww', this is abhorrent. That dog has no comprehension and no choice in partaking of a dangerous and completely optional activity. As humans we should never assume the risks on someone else's behalf, animal or human. Replace that dog with an infant and contemplate whether that is 'aww' or not.
You put that dogs life in danger. Definitely not /r/aww. /r/iamatotalpieceofshit  is closer to the truth.
This looks like a never ending story‚Ä¶.
Does the dog have any idea what's actually going on?
i imagine the dog is heavily drugged given the total lack of reaction (no head motion,  no body movement, closed eyes without blinking‚Ä¶). regardless, i‚Äôm not ok with this. dog can‚Äôt opt out and the landing could hurt him
Definition of ‚Äúwhite people shit‚Äù
What the fuck? Dogs can‚Äôt choose to skydive. They can‚Äôt opt in to that risk
Ah hell no. My dog would have wiggled his way to an early grave so damn fast
This is adorable!
But uh... is it just me, or is it kinda not a great idea to risk your dog's life when you decide to risk your own...?
I‚Äôm not sure about the ethics of paragliding with a dog‚Ä¶
They give that dog some cbd beforehand? Or is it just a really chill dog?
Meh i don't know if the dog is happy about this. This is too risky i won't do this with a dog. But if you say your dog had fun i believe you.
I don‚Äôt like this for some reason, Just because you enjoy flying doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean animals love it too .
Fuck you and your selfie stick. Why would you do this to an animal that can't even consent. Poor dog.
how does he land with the dog like that tho?
Why don't blind people go sky diving?

Scares the shit out of the dog.

Guess I can't use this joke any more.
This is super screwed up. It's not like you can explain to a dog hey let's jump from really high it'll be fun. There is no way to do this to a dog and not traumatize it.

The selfishness of people never ceases to surprise me
Buddy definitely had a few Scooby snacks but who doesn‚Äôt dream of flying when you‚Äôre really baked
Your luck dragon trusts you completely.
Thats so fucked. Just cause you can do it doesnt mean you should.
Everyone lived. Relax Karens. Would you prefer the owner died and the dog had to be sent to a shelter to more then likely die because people only want puppies? Imagine the stories this beautiful doggo can tell his grandkids now. That's a dog that would prefer to be nowhere other than between his masters legs, enjoying life and the bond they have.

I get it, you don't understand the desire to skydive. That's ok. It's not for everyone. But nothing about a dog's life is more important than it's bond with it's master. Everyone had a blast and their bond was even stronger afterwards.
Selfish.
The curled paws absolutely killed me
There is absolutely no way that dog wasn't losing his shit before the parachute opened
I wanted to be mad, but this dog is chill af.
Now I'm curious about landing. How do you not crush the dog?
How do you land without hurting the dog?
I don't like this.
This guy and everyone else involved is a dick
So what happened when they landed? Did the dog get crushed?
*Drugs dog before takeoff*
Hey what about when they land cause Ik u have to roll or something but it looks like he‚Äôs gonna land on the dog
That‚Äôs incredibly fucking dangerous. You really have absolutely no control if that dog starts to freak out for any reason
I wouldn‚Äôt do that with my dog. If I fuck up that‚Äôs on me, I wouldn‚Äôt risk it with my dog.
Seems a bit dangerous, camera with selfie stick , dog in harness ,
This seems incredibly cruel
It anyone else curious as to how they land with the dog getting hurt?
Animal cruelty? No?
I wonder how many dogs he lost before he found one that sat still enough
I‚Äôm sure this dog fully understands the situation and is consenting.
Dog looks okay with it but I‚Äôm
Not sure how I feel about this
This gives me crazy levels of anxiety to watch. What an asshole.
I get that the dog looks calm but can you imagine how scary it would have been for him the first time? There's no way a dog knows the difference between controlled gliding and falling. Fuck this dude lol
Not sure why people feel like they need to jump with their dogs. I guess for internet attention....
This is not awwww‚Ä¶
 Chillest dog ever
That dog was vibing the whole time
Is this the goodest boy of all time?
I have such strong and mixed feelings about this
This may very well be the coolest video and idea on the whole internet.
Don't agree with this at all.
Ah man, this is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all year
It‚Äôs 4am - I‚Äôve been awake only an hour and I already know this will be the best thing I‚Äôll see online all day if not all week
any one notice how the dog is just kinda like vibein like he‚Äôs cuddling with his hooman
Heart sinking into my stomach seeing all the praise for this post‚Ä¶ 

Even if the dog‚Äôs used to it - how could you know it wouldn‚Äôt absolutely terrify them and go horribly wrong the FIRST time? A surfboard is one thing because some dogs love water but strapping a dog into this contraption all with the express intent of doing it just for internet points?‚Ä¶

Also the dog‚Äôs complete lack of response to the man‚Äôs petting and rubbing plus the fact that the dog is only looking straight forward and not moving its legs the WHOLE video‚Ä¶ Have you ever seen a dog poke it‚Äôs head out of a window? They look around and move their head around to enjoy the breeze. I don‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions but there‚Äôs a CHANCE this dog is drugged based on its behavior. Makes me sick. 

The owner doesn‚Äôt seem to really be enjoying the experience either. He‚Äôs concerned about his dog petting it and trying to comfort it. He‚Äôs realizing it probably wasn‚Äôt a good idea. Something he should have thought of at any point in the long lead up to this travesty.

Honestly I‚Äôm shocked by the post and severely disappointed by the response.
I‚Äôve never seen nor heard such a thing!!
Dog looks as happy as can be though!
NEVERENDING STOREEEEEEEEEYYYY!!!!!!
Is he aware of what's going on?
When does the dog start dropping the shit bombs?
That dog is cooler than I am. Not a complaint on my part, just a fact. He's awesome.
Who‚Äôs dumber than a dog? Humans that‚Äôs who! Who‚Äôs a dumb boy? Who‚Äôs the dumb boy?
So fake!  This is green screen. You can see the strings on the guy.
Why tho
Love the level of trust dogs can have for their human. My cat would have clawed my eye balls out in the very beginning.
Why would you even do this? Seems like a great way to unnecessarily stress out and/or injure your dog. What does he do for the landing, and how does the dog not get squished?
The dogs probably scared shitless‚Ä¶
Can you photoshop a happy landing, too? Because we all know that dog suddenly turned into a corgi.
Hahaha that doggy tongue.
[deleted]
Holy shit, that‚Äôs insane. The dog is living the dream‚Ä¶
The doggy looks happy but is most likely terrified and very stressed :(
I'm so happy that there's a dog that gets to live this life.
You are going to land on this thing?
That‚Äôs one of the best flying mounts I‚Äôve ever seen.
That's cool. Really, really cool.
Well.... this is a first!!!
No need to crank the window down. Doggie‚Äôs in heaven!
I have mixed feelings about this...on the one hand, I don't want the dog to have a heart attack on account of its owner...on the other hand, that dude is treating his dog to the best life. Dog doesn't seem to be alarmed so I'll go with the latter.
I don‚Äôt like this. It‚Äôs cruel.
Cruel. This is done just for the owner to make a cool video, hardly as if the dog has some kind of life long dream to fly. Leave the animals alone, attention seeking idiots.
Please tell me you at some point you started singing never ending story.
I want to ride a flying dog!!!
I like how he‚Äôs holding your foot lol
I bet that landing was hella ruff
[Neverending Story](https://youtu.be/lHytjEj7B9g) üé∂
Turn around, look at what you see, yeah

In her face, the mirror of your dreams, whoa

Make believe I'm everywhere, hidden in the lines

Written on the pages is the answer to a Never Ending Story

Never Ending Story
If I hold my Chihuahua it has a panic attack
Never ending storyyyy
Lol that‚Äôs awesome
Feel like he drugged that dog? Can't tell if it's blurred out or terrified and paralyzed by fear. Doesn't feel cool to do to that dog and so many ways the landing could go wrong. Feels abusive.
That's not aww. What happens if they crash? Oh yeah poor pupper dies. This is wrong on so many levels.
White people are so fucked lol
It is so calm and enjoying the ride
Dogs are eternal. Girls are temporary
Bruh‚Ä¶only white ppl‚Ä¶
What breed of dog/dragon is this???
When I turn on the news, this is the type of wholesome shit I want to see
Is this Aspen?
My dog won‚Äôt even walk across bridges
My dog would never forgive me lol he‚Äôs still mad about the vet last month. Lmao
OMG that dog can die happy now. That must have such a great experience for them. They look so content
Why don't blind people go skydiving?



Scares the shit out of the dog.
And you have the bonus of a nice floofball to cushion your crash landing
That dog is *high*
Don't know if the dog is relaxed as F, or it has resorted to stop functioning.
Should played the "Never Ending Story Theme Song"
I think it is shitty to make a dog do that.
like it
That's awesome
Ya, it's not cool to make animals do high risk sports with you for internet points.
The amount of upvotes this got is only slightly surprising, but all of the awards??? How is this cute? Poor dog
that cloudo doggo in his natural habitat, the sky, when his tongues out tho hehehehe
Looks like heaven
More of this please.
This has just brightened up a shit day.
I love how the dog looks unfaced by the situation
That‚Äôs not a dog y‚Äôall he‚Äôs riding a heckin cloud!
Here before this gets to r/all
That dog is so chill.
The trust this dog has for his owner is unbelievable. He's not phased in the slightest!
Literally can‚Äôt stop watching and smiling at this.
Wrong soundtrack

That is possibly the coolest experience I‚Äôve seen in a very long time haha üëè sooo fun.
Instant I saw it I went to never ending story üòÇ
This made my night x
It‚Äôs going to be sad day for that guy when the dog passes. Because that 100% looks like that mans best friend.
OP....What did you do to Artax?
Now someone gonna try this and squish their pooch
Anyone else get a Never Ending Story memory from this?
Dogs is just enjoying that cool breeze.
This is not cool. The dog did not choose to put itself in a dangerous situation for fucking Reddit points. Not ok.

!RemindMe 5 days
I can't help wondering, under what circumstances did he figure out that his dog would enjoy this? I am laughing thinking of them starting out small, like jumping off a chair, then a deck, then a small hill and gradually building up to higher and longer rides. Also laughing thinking of some dumbass watching this video and thinking, "Oh, I bet my dog would love this too!" and just strapping the dog on and it freaks out mid-air.
I hope he made sure his good boy used a tree before doing this‚Ä¶
Aaaaatraaaaayyyuuuuu
The car window isn't gonna cut it anymore.
That dog is chill AF
My cat would lose its shit, I can almost promise you.
I'm  jealous, one of my dogs can only last about five minutes in the car before we have to pull over so he can take a shit.
I'm thinking how are they gonna land?
I want to see how he lands - is it like blind skydiving where the lead goes slack ?
They should make doggie goggles with those color blind lenses - let him get the full experience :)
Look at that man riding a lovely puffy cloud.

I was thinking never-ending story than i found out Falcor is Fuchur in english. :D
We want to see what landing looks like...
Imagine spreading his legs![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)
What a dog's life

My dog would've had a heart attack hahahha
This pupper is mighty brave!
To go where no dog has gone before!
That dog's brain has to be imploding
There better be quadruple reinforcement on that harness
que maximo e ameei a musica
Without the glider, that dog is basically your average MMO mount.
Thought this was the never ending story for a second..
Really? Africa is great and all but how are you not playing the Never Ending Story theme?!
Does this not greatly confuse the animal. Imagine someone kicked you out of a plane without the ability to communicate whats gonna happen before hand.

My Dog needs to be carried down our 8steps stair.
What's landing like with a setup like this? Landing always seems so violent with one person, how do you protect the pup?
What a cute calm floof. But I‚Äôd be terrified for them, not so much for myself.
>You're a little too heavy buddy!

>YEAH!
This should have Limahl's "Neverending Story" song instead....
Now imagine a chihuahua strapped in the same manner kicking its feet like it‚Äôs swimming
Epic mount
That dog looks so high man.

Love both the good luck dragon Falkor and your pupper!
That dog is probably scared out of his mind
!remindme 1 day
How do you land without crushing the dog‚Äôs legs?
How is pupper so chill?
I went skydiving and blew out my knee on the landing. That poor dog has no idea how to land safely and avoid injury. I'd be surprised if he wasn't injured on the landing. This is incredibly stupid.
I'm glad he looks chill, but this gives me bad vibes.
The dogs feet are longer than how far you can stretch your legs in that harness... what was the landing like?
üî•üî•üî•
Does the dog actually like this? He‚Äôs so calm I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs relaxing or frozen scared

Cloudboye is at home in the sky
Yeahhh!!
So Majestic
A flying dog . Whatever will humans think of next
And that dog is for sure on some drugs
I should be mad, but that‚Äôs the happiest a dog could ever travel.
He sooo happy üòÉ
Happy flying Sammie
I love Falcor!
Fly like an eagle Would of been dope lol
I feel like I'm not giving my dog sufficient opportunities rn
Thanks to his owner, this dog has successfully cracked how to get out of the car window and just enjoy that full bodied wind and smells overload that await, if only they could get out of the window. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve see a dog look quite as happy as this one does. It‚Äôs insane.

Yeaaaaaah! -Peter Griffin
How do you train a dog to be this chill?
give your dog thick socks next time?
This is the most beautiful video i‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs so heartwarming. Take my complimentary gold üèÖ
Falcor!!!!
How will the landing work?
Best video of 2021
Falkor!!!!!
''The legend of the fluffy flying dragon and his buddy''
That dog is terrified.
I wonder if the dog understands what's going on. Like, does he know they're really high up?
It all fun and games until your beloved pupper looks at you like Alan Rickman
!RemindMe 7 days
It's oppa üòÇ
To be inside that dogs head for just a few seconds.
So at first look I thought ‚Äú damn I bet that dog is Greek in out‚Äù then I saw the dogs face and he is just CHILLIN. I love it
That's the most awesome thing I've seen
Where is this?
[removed]
Anyone jealous of the dog?!
Is there a cat harness available for this? I know a fluffy dude who would love this
that cute fluffy unicorn
Dog poo bombs.
that pup is never going back to open car windows again! they just don't hit the same way anymore
Turn around. Look at what you seeeeEeeEeeEeeEee...
Need to replace this music with the music from never ending story
Telluride!?
I am so insanely jealous of that.
A what?
!remindme 7 days
That‚Äôs so awesome
Eversince he saw A Neverending Story as a boy... üêâ
That actually made my entire night! Sooo cool
So will he land on da poor floofy dwagon?
God damn it I love Reddit.
how are you going to land with the floof between your legs? like your legs crack when you land
That's Soo cool ü§©

This must be the ultimate version of sticking his head out the window while in a car
!remindme 1 week
I love this so much I want to eat it with a spoon.
Not only is this guy sky diving but also carrying a dog and somehow still have attention to hold a selfie stick (not even mounted)

Lol, someone's going to think a pterodactyl shit on them
How do they land safely?
Needs the how to train your dragon theme over top of it
Lol. Doggo is so chill about flying through the air.
That cloud looks like a dog!
Looks like some Chinese myth.
How do you land to ensure the dog doesn't get hurt?
I hope he lives on the first floor. That dog is going to think he can fly
Cute dog, but I will never understand doing activities like parasailing or ziplining with an animal.
The dog is thinking ‚Äúthis sucks. All I can smell is this dudes balls‚Äù
