She looks like a muppet
If it makes you feel better, I had a dog I named Cinderblock.
This dog looks like a stuffed animal.
I absolutely love that vacant opposite of cross eyed look
I have this belief that Cavaliers don't know how to be mean. 
This picture epitomizes that.
Her one brain cell bounces around her skull like a dvd screensaver. I can relate.

I would die for her.
Omg I‚Äôm dying laughing. Thank you. Dixie is a good girl!

Edit clarification
I have a soft spot for the derpier animals.
Poor little adorable dum dum
My Blenheim cavalier was the most amazing little boy. He wasn‚Äôt the sharpest crayon but he was the most loyal and bestest boy. Lost him in July and I miss him every day.
Smart dogs are overrated. They figure out how to open doors and steal chicken nuggets out of the toaster oven.
Man cavaliers are truly the most amazing dogs. My best mates buddy and Ben (sadly now passed) will always hold a special place in my heart. What they lack in actual intelligence they more than make up for in emotional intelligence and comedy.
Rowlf's cousin.
I had a Blenheim Cavalier and we always joked that she was pretty but dumb. She and her sister (another Blenheim) were just about the sweetest things ever, even if they barked more at me wearing my hair differently than they did at the stranger at the door.
"When you look this good, you don't have to know anything." - Philip J Fry
I love her
My wife wanted a King Cavalier for years..and this summer somebody dumped an older Shiz Tzu on our street. We adopted him and he has become her lap dog. He is so sweet she wants our next dogs to be the same breed.
As smart as the day is wide.
She's a good girl.
Sir, that's a muppet.
I aspire to have a brain as uncomplicated as Dixies
I have one of those too. You look at them and there isn't anything there. He may be dumber than a bucket of hair, but I love him and he's always a happy boy.
She is so cute. She reminds me of my cocker spaniel I had growing up named Tiffany. She was also not very bright. Ok that was an overstatement. She was cute. Funny thing is in middle school there was a mean girl with the same name. One day I got fed up with her BS and told her "My dog has the same name as you and she isn't that smart but is way smarter than you and 100 times better looking than you." I then showed her a photograph of my dog I kept in my purse since this was before smartphones. To be truthful my pup was supet adorable. She always got compliments. I left the girl with her mouth open like a fish out of water. Give your pupper cuddles and loves for me.
Look at that absolute *muppet!*
Those eyes. They look into my soul. Well one does, the other is probably seeing someone else‚Äôs soul.
Oh bless her heart
Motor's running, but noone is behind the wheel.

&#x200B;

The father of my 2nd dog had an even dumber look and he was dumb. Sometimes my dog gives me the same look as her father, but she isn't stupid, she knows what she is doing.
Awww, who da cutie uh WHO DA CUTIE? What an adorable little cutie, you just want to pick her up and give hugs. Thanks for sharing the pic.
Hey, so am I!
My friend had one of these dogs, unfortunately due to the massive amount of inbreeding in the breed the 95-99% of them experience a condition where their brain grows too big for the skull. It‚Äôs a sad slow process to watch.

Syringohydromyelia, also known as Chiari-type malformation
So she‚Äôs a genius?
 She looks like she barks backwards but also, I‚Äôd die for her! Thank you for the smile Dixie & op!
You don't have to smart when you are that cute.
I've seen this guy on the Muppet Show.
A master mind of seduction and mischief, she will get belly rubs and snacks no matter what
No thoughts just vibes
She looks stupidly smart... love her
I love this dog with my whole heart
Looks like the clown from "IT" lmao
I can see Einstein in those eyes
A genius then?
I bet she is a great cuddler
She also looks like she is friendly as could be. Please let her be friendly
This dog deserves all the love she gets ‚ù§
God why did i laughhhh
I would trust her with my life.
That face belongs on a cryptocurrency!
I LOVE HER!
She and her brother are cute haha
awww. melted <3
She may be a bit of a derp, but she look to be a sweet little girl!
And I love her.
has the derpiest smile on her face, i love it
So she‚Äôs a dang genius
But she's a good girl.
Dixie should run for Congress, bless her heart.
When your adorable & full of love & enthusiasm it doesn't matter one hill of beans if your dumb.
She may not be a smart dog, but she knows what love is.
Are her eyes..looking in different directions?
Her name is so perfect! So cute!
Awww. She looks happy. And what does knowing things get you anyway? Heartache!
Please tell her that I love her very much
How did wolves turn into "this"...
Inbreeding is a hell of a drug
Bork Bork
floof

f l o o f
She‚Äôs as cute as she looks.
she's cute
She is a genius. She knows all the knowledge there is to know. She just doesn‚Äôt know what it means and assumes the purpose of the universe is food.
awwwwww....
She's got my vote.
Brain cell be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just happy to be here‚Äù
You‚Äôre God damn genius Gump, must have an IQ of 160!
Wow this made my downer of a day much brighter. I laughed out loud.
Cute but stupid. Who needs to be smart when you're a loving, friendly dog?
One eye lookin‚Äô at you, one eye lookin‚Äô for you
We don‚Äôt love cavaliers for their intelligence we love them for their unrelentingly happy disposition. Dixie is just a prime example I imagine.
I have had a few Cavaliers over the years and they definitely have a wide range in intelligence. Some of them are very smart animals. Some of them forget that you are their owner from day to day.
I opened up the pic and the thought process was - 

*"surely it can't be that bad.   small dogs are keen dogs, there's no way....  oh.  Oh dear."*
She looks like a Muppet version of a dog.
I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs still smarter than most people‚Ä¶
Hey! I think I saw her on Sesame Street once!
Dixie just proves what we all know to be true: If you‚Äôre pretty, you don‚Äôt have to be smart!
Looks like a dog wearing a dog costume
So freaking cute haha

Not a thought behind those eyes üòÅ
Damn, that's a cute looking professor!
Ummmm she doesn‚Äôt look very smart‚Ä¶.no offense cause neither does my dog ü§£
We are actively breeding those dogs because we call them "cute" and people spend money on them.

The ancestors of this degenerative mutation of a dog was a wolf once.

This is like breeding midget people for personal entertainment and making then dumber and uglier because it is amusing to see something miserable.


Does no one else think that this is morally fucked up?
This is quite a rare doggy
This dog can read!?
She is just so happy to be there
Cute
This a Cavachon? I currently have a 3 month old Cavachon girl and could totally see her looking like this as an adult lol
Looks smart to me.
She looks like my old doctor.
She looks like a stuffed animal.
Smile reminds me of Jack Nicholson portraying Joker
Our cavalier has no sense of direction and only has three teeth left, all of which are on one side of his mouth (very wonky smile). I feel like he and Dixie would get along well haha
Awww he/she soo cutrr
She looks like she occasionally forgets her own name and I love her.
MA ITS THAT FUCKING DOG AGAIN
So she runs a large criminal organization on Tatooine?   This is canon now.
She look like the same face that my dog have
OOOO pretty girl
Doesn‚Äôt look smart but looks very lovable.
She looks like Private (one of the penguins) from the Madagascar movie and I want to be her friend
If you haven't read it and have a minute, Allie Brosh has an amazing, wet-your-pants bit in her book Hyperbole and a half about her dumb dog. Super short and super funny. Promise.

Please enjoy and give this baby lots of love from all of us here!
The name‚Äôs Dixie. Dixie Normus. 

Well, Ms. Normus, shall we shag now or shag later?
Um that's a cookie monster, not a dog
Must be one of the smartest dogs alive.
She looks like a stuffed toy!
As I've come to find, simple dogs are the happiest dogs.
Title made me laugh out loud, thanks for cheering me up!
IDK looks can be deceiving. She just stole my heart without even trying. Explain that sorcery!
Whatever the opposite of cross eyed is, that's what this dog is. And it's fricken adorable!!!
This came from a wolf....
That dog looks tough to sneak up on, if you know what I mean.
I find it interesting how some dog breeds can look like there isn't a whole lot going on up top, while others you can actually tell they're actually thinking and are quite intelligent.
Sooo she‚Äôs a genius?
the cutest, most flawless and smoothest brain inside that floofy head
Now that is one meme-able dog.

MFW anyone asks me international politics.
As long as she's happy.
God damn genius- im guessing
Aww her 2 brain cells are rattling around like ping-pong balls in a bucket. She cute though.
IQ of 32... But in dog years.
The dumb ones are my favorite.  All brain stem.
Bro that dog is so cute
This thing looks helpless
Did it just pee ?
Hiya Georgie
Mom had a Yorkie. Dumb as a brick but loyal and friendly to a fault to everyone. Shy around other dogs, and loved chasing rabbits she knew she'd never catch. Loved nothing more than belly rubs and sitting on laps.  

Good dog. Miss her.
I truly love her with all my heart!
Dixie is so cute. She looks like a stuffed toy.
hIyA gEoRgIe!
I would die for Dixie
Tell me whatever you want, that is not Dixie. That is Pennywise in dogform.
Is she looking at me or you?
Looks like she sounds like that *fat and sassy* lady.
This has been on the top of my feed the past few times I've opened reddit. I am absolutely ok with this.
She only has a couple brain cells, but damn it she‚Äôs doing her best.
Aww she's so adorable though
I hope she's as happy as she looks
So pretty smart, huh?
no offense, but she doesnt even look real
She is so precious, I could just die üòçüò´
Adorable!
So mad cute genius?
Why do I feel compelled to take a bullet for Dixie?
All of the neurons in her brain have been used in that precious smile
She's as smart as she needs to be and that's all that matters
Oh bless her doggy heart
That dog is 100% fucking stupid however it is also 100% the most loving dog you could ever come across
Every spaniel I've met is the epitome of "no thoughts, head empty". My parents have had two so far, so it's something we like at least...
I had a cocker spaniel namd lucky( found in a ditch in tge winter) poor bastard was so dumb he would knock himself out by running headfirst into trees chasing butterflies. He once tried to eat fishing lures, no bait just hooks and rattles, drank all the melted butter after a shrimp boil, ran head first into the bumper of our car when we got home( again unconscious) scared of his own farts,  they are bird dogs but he couldn't swim. That's the start of a really long list.
There‚Äôs a reason women prefer small dogs.
There‚Äôs a reason women prefer small dogs.
Cavvies! Aren't they pretty? Going to have to get by on their looks!
She's such a derp, I love her.
This made me laugh so, so hard on a day that‚Äôs been so, so shit. Thanks for sharing Dixie with us ‚òÄÔ∏è
I wanna kiss her empty noggin
Might get a tattoo of her
I didn't know Rowlf had a sister.
Sbe doesn‚Äôt look very....ohh.
Funny that I see this right when I open Reddit after losing my King Charles a couple of hours ago to lymphoma. Dixie‚Äôs face makes me laugh and reminds me of my little doofus. Thanks for sharing haha
I think she's a sweetheart
found my new comfort pic. awwwwwwwww
Ah yes, a being of infinite knowledge beyond mortal understanding.
I feel like this dog has no thoughts but also knows exactly how the world will end
Cookie Monster.
Now that is a muppet
It kinda looks like a plushie
She looks like a stuffed animal! ü§©ü•∞ü§óüòçü§™
I will defend this dog with my life. No harm or misfortune shall come to this pup. I give her my sword and shield. Dixie shall live a long and prosperous life and bring nations to their knees with her doopie doodle eyes, her wumpy dumpy waddles, and her floopy woopy ears.
You claim she's not that smart. But who is living the good life getting all the upvotes and who is having to work for his noms and get rid of his own poop?
/watch puppy do something silly

Silly puppy... It's okay, I still love you.
A simple picture of a living thing just sitting there has never made me laugh so hard.
HAHAHAHA ILY DIXIE
the way this title and pic actually made me laugh out loud. dixie is adorable. love her. thanks for the laugh op.
Does she run into walls? I'm concerned about her eyes.
How does it remember to breathe?
She looks like Rolf from the Muppet Show
She looks like she commited genocide and is faking a mental disability to avoid execution
That dog looks like it has 2 braincells and they both take turns
Why can‚Äôt I stop staring and laughing at this ‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm crying
Bless her dopey little heart. 12/10, would give her three treats.
She is precious and must be protected. Probably literally.
a genius then
You're just jealous 'cause Mom likes ***her*** best.
So earnest, what a face!!
I‚Äôd gather she‚Äôs as friendly as she looks too
I would die for her.
They say dogs look like their owners
She looks like a Muppet. Cute!
She looks like IT (penny wise)
You made me spit beer
I usually hate my slow internet.
Today, I don't, it allowed me to laugh hilariously when I saw the dog. I expected the title to be a joke, and that minute built up expectation X) 
She's cute as hell tho
cute chonky legs!!!
I bet she‚Äôs just the sweetest lil baby
Why tf dis got 124k upvotes???

What‚Äôs the IQ of adorableness?
Is that a King Charles cocker spaniel? 

I love that the whites of her eyes are looking at the camera.
üåíüëÖüåò
My parents dog had eyes like that‚Ä¶after the stroke.
That ain‚Äôt no dog

Adorable derp.
If you‚Äôre that cute, you don‚Äôt have to be smart üòÇ
There is no thoughts behind those eyes. Just a clapping monkey inside that head üòÇ
Yikes
I'm not sure why. 
But your short description of her, with her pic made me laugh so hard. ü§£ü§£ü§£
She looks like the kind of dog that would bark at their own fart. 

The goodest. #WeLoveDixie
Absolutely has the highest IQ I‚Äôve seen. For a pupper lol
Awwwww
What an adorable little derp face. Bet she's a great little cuddlebug!
# And the award for the derpiest looking dog goes too‚Ä¶
This actually looks creepy...
What kind of dog is this?!?! I want a dog but I cannot have one yet, I love this dog though. So adorable!! I would love to do research on it to see if they‚Äôre my kinda buddy.
Get creamed on bum loser
[deleted]
He a doggo
Is her job title receptionist by chance
They look like a dumbass fucking pug
Not cute
That is mean.  And, if true, sad.
The whole point of owning animals as pets is to feel superior, in a sense.
Bitch has got Down's!
I want that dogs life.
awwww. she's sooo cuteee
Lol she looks like a stuffed animal
Does Mr. Henson know you've found Scruffins?

She looks like John Carter's little sidekick! So precious!
She looks like a puppet choking on herself.
Thinking that is a descendant of a wolf, it reminds of homunculus. Then I am disturbed.
she looks like a stuffed animal.
She looks so happy though. Maybe ignorance is bliss after all
Dixie, I appreciate you. \[As my whippet cross tests our yard's fence like a determined velociraptor.\]
She looks like a stuffed animal
is that a Dog?

or pig?

Is this a cavalier king charles?
DERP
My dad married a woman named Dixie, and these two share an eerie resemblance.
CAreful op. You know how they say some owners resemble their dogs...
Ohhhhh my god.
I want to squeeze that little dog.

What a perfect face.
I love her
Get this pup a MENSA card

She‚Äôs beautiful tho!
So like Elmo smart!!
She looks like a spider
Poor Cretan
Very cute
Do you have any pictures from different angles? I told my wife this is the kind of dog I want, but my wife thinks this dog looks "derpy".

I told her it was just the angle, and I hope I'm right.
She's smart right? *right?*
So she's a genius...?
she has one eye on the treat and the other on her food bowl, love her!
If goofy was an animal
Still probably a lot smarter than most of the people I have to deal with in life‚Ä¶
I get it‚Äôs a puppy but like it kinda looks creepy
She must be the next Einstein then
So more intelligent than the average human?
I'm actually not convinced its not a stuffed animal
I‚Äôd like to think that dark spot under her is piss
I had a friend who owned one and he told me, "They're great family dogs but dumb as a bag of rocks"  lol

That said, I'd own one in a minute.  I think Dixie is adorable!
aww how cute! she deserves all the belly rubs
Bet she chews on sweaty socks
Hiya, Georgie!
This dog looks fucking hilarious
Looks like she stepped off the set for the Muppets.
"You are exactly as smart as you look" would be one of the most passive-aggressive things I've ever said.
I gotta be honest. This is the cutest dog I have ever seen. What‚Äôs her name?
But i love her with my whole heart
Dixie may not be the smartest, but she sure is adorable.
Awwwww so adorable!!!!
Best girl already!
Does she make cider ?
You cant fool me, thats pennywise.
ü§£ü§£ü§£
A right genius.
Simply exquisite pup, 5000/10 stars
Dixie is a saint, 12/10, thanks for sharing
Must be the smartest dog in the world then
[deleted]
While arguably adorable, is this nornal for this breed or is Dixie a wee bit *too* inbred somewhere in the pedigree?
Mean, but funny.
The last sentence got me
That is some Wallace & Gromit looking dog
Dixie is a super dog! she's keeping an eye on the front and the back door for you.
Dixie looks like she saying that you're an idiot for thinking I'm dumb when you pick up my crap and tell me I'm good when I pee and poop on your lawn
Looks like a muppet
Looks like a toad with fur. Cute dog.
Are you certain she is not a sentient plush toy?
What kind of dog is that?
Ferb! This one‚Äôs looking at both of us at the same time.
Reminds me of Loca, the Pug that Couldn't Feckin' Run

https://youtu.be/x2RJN9a_jdM
She looks like she spends her free time running into walls over and over.
No dog could be that dumb.
[I have a Pomeranian that looks like her twin. :) shes in the back left. ](https://imgurupload.org/files/54174002-326D-45D2-9931-77F0A6449254.jpeg)
Such a good girl!
So a genius?
She looks like she was drawn by an 8 year old and I love her.
I like this one
Stop being mean to muppet dog
I am intimidated by here smartness
I love Cavaliers, I really do. But they can really be as dumb as a box of rocks at times.

But great family pets.
Omg awwwwww

Does that mean she can talk? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)

Puppy mill dog?

She reminds me of a dog Mickey or Minnie mouse had

She can watch opposing corners of the same room!
My best friend growing up had 1 of these and he was the stupidest dog. Reminded me of the dumb hyena (Ed) from lion king üòÇ
She looks like a rejected muppet.

On dirait une peluche üß∏ ! Adorable !!
Damn, the graphics in the new Pixar movies are getting really good
‚ÄúHiya, Georgie‚Äù
What a muppet
I love Dixie with my entire heart and I would die for her if she so asked
what kind of breed is that?

thanks!
This looks exactly like my dog, just different colours.  King Charles x Pug?
She, like the terrifying hammerhead shark, has an expanded range of peripheral vision, indicating that she is infact a pinnacle predator. Don't be fooled!!
If she's as happy as she looks then she's probably the happiest dog this side of the universe.
Emotional genius
Well that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a stuffed animal.
She is such a sweet looking girl, awwww ü•∞
She looks like a poorly made Chinese knockoff of a stuffed animal lol
I don‚Äôt care how smart.. I love you Dixie!!!

Looks like a Minecraft dog , how they walleye‚Äôd

I legit thought this was a taxidermy gone wrong üòë
awwwww pls no doggie shame thx
Those inbreds are so cute
She looks like the bestest girl tho
The term; It's a good thing you're pretty comes to mind.
So I was talking to my wife Dixie the other day and she was saying you weren't a very good actor, and I agreed with her - now-now why-now why Colin, why would we both say that?
She is adorable, simple as that üíúü¶¥üá¨üáß
Me after i feel liquid after farting
Cute
Dixie must be protected at all costs.
Japanese chin?
Awww, she looks so special.
Bless her heart
Smarter than most people I know for sure
Derpsie
She has a low key evil smile
So mega smart. Got it
haha
Doesn't matter if she's smart - is she a good girl?

**YES**
Who is she looking at? 

Can it walk a straight line, or does it sniff for food on the ground all the time?

Somewhere off screen mom & dad are eating or holding treats.. (bet) 

ü§£
It is obviously a direct descendant of Patrick Star
I had a beautiful cavalier named Sita - stunningly beautiful, so photogenic. I always said she would need to marry well because she was as dumb as a box of rocks ‚Ä¶

Is she as sweet as she looks tho bc she looks like the sweetest girl ever. After my 2 girl dogs of course.

Her eyes really be like ‚¨ÖÔ∏èüëÅ üëÅ‚û°Ô∏èBrooooo I feel like she‚Äôs seeing everything around her from two different perspectives
r/whatswrongwithyourdog
She's got those eyes that are looking at yesterday and tomorrow at the same time.
So shes not smart
She is so cute! I love her!
"Don't mind me, I'm going to go poop on the carpet."
Aw
There is not one thought behind those eyes
This dog belongs in a soundgarden music video
She doesn‚Äôt have to be smart when she is that cute.
Smart as a rug
So she is the next Einstein?
My heart! What a sweet puppy.
So she has a phD in Astrophysics ü•∞
Hey at least your dog has the hidden ability of being able to see everyone in a room at once.
Are those googly eyes, Or is your dog part chameleon?
She‚Äôs brilliant!
Not a single thought it processing inside that head.
I cant understand if thats an insult or praise
Looks like elmo
Oh I love her
I used to have a Dixie too!  Sometimes she would drive the car.. miss the old girl though.. because my Dixie Wrecked..
I was giggling while opening the link, and it was better then I could have asked for. Thank you!
She looks like she‚Äôs a stuffed animal
Happy little one.ü§ü
On a scale of 1 to inbred, she seems to be leaning towards the inbred side...
This is the dumbest looking dog I've ever seen. I love her.
I'm sorry but that's not a dog it is a living puppet.
Just looking at this dog made me feel better. Thank you I needed that today.
She looks like an Economics Professor I had, so she looks very smart indeed
She looks smarter than I am.
Lucky
Wait is she really a Harvard graduate?
My grandmother also has a dog of same breed, they're absolutely the best. Derpy but cute!
What a derpy girl!
I love Dixie
*No thought, head empty*

What a cutie
You mean she's a vely vely smart girl????!!!
Hiiii Dixie, can you please explain the difference between a super volcano and a regular volcano?
‚ÄúI may not be a smart dog, but I know what love is.‚Äù‚ÄîDixie
This dog looks like a muppetüòÅ
My moms dogs have the same vacant look...lights are on but no one is home.  I blame it on too much inbreeding.
She looks like the canine version of Wendy the Slow Adult from Howard stern
Definitely looks like you would have to remind her, she never had balls.
She's trying her best!
So you‚Äôre saying she‚Äôs a goddamn genius?
I love Dixie dearly. ‚ù§
I guess Kermit and Ralph decided to have a designer baby
I'm a lot smarter than I look.  Everyone misunderestimates me.
I too have a Shih-tzu who's not the brightest bulb on the tree. 8 years old and she's never figured out how to do stairs. She just stares and whines and barks.

I tell her all the time, "It's a good thing you're so cute"
sir that‚Äôs a muppet
She's too lovable!
It‚Äôs like a dog fucked a muppet..
How do I ban subs
She looks brilliant, and don‚Äôt let anybody else tell you otherwise! Good girl!!!
Wow
So you‚Äôre telling she‚Äôs a fucking genius?
Which eye am I looking at to decide how smart she looks?
Inbreeding ftw.
Hurr durr
Good dog
Awwww. Don't you just love the dopey ones, that much more? But honestly, is the poor things eyes crossed?
Who‚Äôs so smart?!!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äùderp‚Äù
She cute tho
What breed?
Your dog looks like dilapidated retriever
OMG I love that little genius
we took wolves and turned them into this
But she looks like the fun, lovable kind of dumb.
Looks like if a animatronic dog was able to experience the side affects of cocaine and LSD
So do you play along and pretend that stuffed animal is a real dog too, for your moms sake?
She‚Äôs perfect.
I recommend getting this dig checked for eye cancer. Sorry, I know that is outside of the aww context.
She knows Quantum Physics?
Cavaliers have my heart
This dog looks like a Muppet. And I'm all for that.
That‚Äôs a stuffed animal yo
Ahhh so brilliant
She looks fine to me ¬∞üëÑ¬∞
Ah, good, she is a genius
She looks like a good dog
At least she is cute, better than me... dumb and ugly
She is so aDURRable.
She looks so cute and happy!
so very smart
üçû
Gives me Pennywise vibes
Your dog looks exactly like my stuffed animal I got 18 years ago
If only Cavaliers put any evolution points into intelligence or heart health. :-/ my grandmother always has a few, they are always so silly
Lmao King Charles spaniels are so sweet but yeah, so dumb. The way they‚Äôve been bred over time caused most of them to have neurological issues. Similar to doodles. Stop breeding dogs, y‚Äôall.
That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ saying a lot. Adorable though!
Awwww
The perfect post doesn‚Äôt exi‚Ä¶.
So, uh, not very.
Terrifying, how can you keep something like that around the house?
Adorable little girl ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Am doggo. No thought, head empty, only pant pant. Am gud girl." XD she's still adorable though
We had a dog named Dixie too!  We rescued her with the name.  We tried changing it, but for a good week she would look at us stupid as we tried to rename her Benny.  One day talking about her she heard the name Dixie and went nuts.  We decided that day we had to keep the name.
lovely doggy!!
How the fuck is this "aww?" That poor dog is hideous. You people are fake as fuck.
I think we just found the cousin to that dog from, ‚ÄúMitchells vs. the Machines.‚Äù
This dog‚Äôs derp is erp
I thought she peed on herself at first.
SOUTHERN MEN THE THUNDERS MUTTER
NORTHERN FLAGS IN SOUTH WINDS FLUTTER
That‚Äôs a perfect compliment
‚ÄúSmart she‚Äôs not. Adorable she is‚Äù
