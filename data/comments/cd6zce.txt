Legit the most adorable thing I'll see all day.

Awe! Thank you. I needed to see some sweetness all week.
Hahaha the dude is almost starting to cry look how his lower lip trembles oh now I’m crying too it’s so cute!
That's one affectionate bird
How fucking sweet is that bird? Someone do the math.
Hopper from stranger things!!
Both are so handsome
I just want to confess something. I don't think this is the right place to comment something like this, but I'll do it anyway. I've been feeling guilty about this for years.

When I was 12 or 13 years old, we had a bird just like this one. It would sit on my family's and mine shoulders, just being cute. But it shat everywhere and made annoyingly loud noise when it was in its cage. We didn't let it out much towards the end, because of the shitting. We stopped caring about him...

Then came summer, and it was nice outside, so we put the cage outside at day, and inside at night. One day, we went to relatives and didn't put the cage inside. We also didn't check the weather, which was a bad idea. There was a storm later which knocked down the cage and the bird managed to escape.

It escaped before, but always came back, but that was when we were still good for the bird. I still feel terrible about this and photos and videos of birds always remind me of him. I wish I was wiser, and had always been good to him. I can't imagine what he must have been through in the "wild". I hope he's in a better place now. I'm sorry if bored you with my story, or this isn't the right place for it. I'm also sorry for my bad English as it is not my first language. I'm also sorry about the bird, I really am...

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just needed to get this of my chest.
That is fuckin adorable
I just made some really unmanly sounds.
he loves dude's beard....dude blushed!😚
You can see him trying not to cry this is so wholesome
Awe😍😍🥰
Is that jim from stranger things?
The bird is cute. 

His reaction made my brovaries implode.
I love birds. Grew up with a few budgies and cockatiels and they are extremely intelligent and affectionate.

I taught one of the cockatiels to say “fuck off cunt” to my parents dismay. And then he learnt to mimic the phone, so at 1am you’d hear the “phone” ringing and then followed by a “FUCK off cunt”.

He really emphasised the “fuck” in that string of words. 

RIP mate miss ya
My birb passed away last month, he was such a sweet little guy who would gently nibble on my earlobe and snuggle up to my neck. To me he was sweet at least, he was a terror to anyone else writhing striking distance. I miss him.
Birds are so smart. It's crazy. It's a totally different type of intelligence than mammals have too. Their brains are wired so differently than ours. Such awesome.
They're both so adorable
The perfect guy doesn’t exi—
How cute! Kinda want a bird now.
"I can see all of the little microscopic inhabitants of your skin, I'll eat as many as I can . . . for love"
This is prime r/awww right here
We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals ― **Emmanuel Kant**
Human looks about to cry and honestly same
Widdle birdie loves 😍😍😍 and the human isn’t hard on the eyes either
I JUST saw a video of him on FB! Turned his family farm into an animal rescue! I plan on one day having land/money to do that as well! Seeing his video made me sooo happy♥️
So birds actually show affection? That’s so cute
This just tells me that we don't see enough birds on r/aww
I went out with a woman once who had a pet bird. She and I don't talk, but I think about that bird often. I think I've never had an animal warm up to me quicker.
So that’s what happened to Hopper?
Awhhhhh!! My parrot does a similar thing! I'll give her kisses and she either cuddles up to my neck or cheek. Or she will walk up to me and "kiss" my cheek by pecking me on the cheek and making a kiss noise and she does it over and over and over u too I give her another kiss XD they are too cute!!!
THIS JUST CURED MY CANCER
This is one of the biggest things I miss with having a bird. Assure from the noise and cage cleaning, they are very loving.
This is too precious.
That is probably the most darndest cutest thing I may have ever done did see in my little ol life
You can see the moment his brovaries give out.
We don’t deserve animals😭😭😭
My Bird died some days ago and this brings a smile at my face...all the nice memories and stuff
Even a /r/partyparrot needs a cuddle now and then.
what breed is that
You look like a younger version of hopper from stranger things
See my parrot did this and then proceeded to randomly STRIKE and bite me...
HOLD UP he looks "familiar" did he tell you to do Spanish or something like that?
This has to be the most beautiful thing I have seen in a long time. Way to make a grown man cry  😊❤
He’s fine af.
Priceless!!
I just thorgasmed
I love birds, but I can only admire them from a distance— I’ve never had a pet bird but I had one bite my finger just about clean off as a kid. I just don’t know how to read their beady little eyes?

I adore most of them but they scare the hell outta me too.
The expression he makes when the bird first snuggles back makes my heart melt. It's the equivalent feeling of when a guy is good with babies, you know? It's just heart warming.
My parrot died today and seeing this makes me happy sad ): beautiful bird
My ovaries 😍
Birb?
So this is where Hopper disappeared to
How come people cant just say “bird” or “human”
Look at that beak go!
Maybe ur beard hairs scratch him and he likes it a bit too!
Sweetest thing!!
OMG what a sweetheart! <3
You are BOTH adorable♡
I wish you could litter train birds, I want a shoulder pal but I don't want a poopy back
Can't stop watching this.
You look like a young hopper
My heart!!! His heart too 😭
Young David Harbour
dextor and thor
Hahaha, I know that expression he makes too well. I do it all the time with my pets.
Why do birds like biting your hair? I had a parrot on my shoulder for a few minutes yesterday, and it bit my hair, over and over. Sometimes ripping the hair out
He looks like he's about to cry. I don't blame him though, I would too if a borb did that to me.
Adorable
My budgie does this 💕
Bird up ☝
Best bromance of all time
Those birds are sweet until their not. Devil birds imo...
He looks so happy
Jesus. My heart just melted.
I love everything about this. Thank you.
WATCH OUT THERE’S A DRONE ON YOUR SHOULDER
I can even hear him say "awwww"
What kind of bird is this?
My bird hates me he bit my finger but I still love him ❤️😂
Birds are honestly the best, mine falls asleep in the crook of my hand and I love it.
I'm smiling so much it hurts! I visited  barnsanctuary.org and will definitely make plans to visit. I would love to  volunteer weekly but I reside in Massachusetts where I volunteer at other local animal shelters. Your a good man 😊👍❤️
This makes me smile, thank you.
What a nice end to the week. Thank you
The affection parrots show towards you is amazing.  Its this little tiny fluffy feathered thingy making sweet sounds to tell you it loves you and the expression of its little eyes is full of love.
Even when they scream and bitch to you, even those moments are adorable.

Parrots are fucking amazing.
That bird fixed the dude's hair. Right when the guy's eyebrow lifts, the bird tucks a strand of hair behind the guy's ear. That bird is the dude's wingman.
Thanks for sharing this!
That is just darling.
I just love birds so much 😭
It really looks like the parrot genuinely loves him. I wonder if we underestimate just how sentient our pets are.
my three year green cheek canure passed away three days ago. I would give anything in the world to get him back. This is a beautiful moment.
That's Dan McKernan from Barn Sanctuary. Their Instagram account has some amazing videos.
Sweetest facial expression from them both.
you just made everybody on reddit want a bird
Can we please just sticky this to the top of r/all forever?
I just made the CRAZIEST squealing noise. thank you so much for this
I can’t quit this post
I wish my bird showed affection like this.  He prefers to regurgitate on me.
Snugs: check
Preen the beard: check
Comb back that one strand of hair: check

Conclusion: Human would be hopeless without birb
I have a friend who is afraid of birds, so I make it my life’s mission to send her cute bird gifs and videos. 


This one tops them all. Thank you.
This guy looks like a younger David Harbour the cop from stranger things.
Cutest thing I've seen all day. He is so precious! Birds are so unique as companions. This one seems so loving and awwweesomme!
this made my day! the little birdie is so adorbs...
I'm jealous of this guy's beard genes.

The bird is pretty cool as well.
Reddit has singlehandedly made me fall in love with birds.
"You be good, see you tomorrow. I love you"

RIP Alex

F
This guy is so fucking cute. The bird too.
I just got the last shred of manliness ripped outta me from the noise I just made
I need one too bad my cat would viciously attack it. 😩
Hopper is a birb person!
Awww... cutest thing! I love the face rub!
Oh my, gah.
Now that is love. So sweet.
the guy looks like he's about to cry at one point .... aww
That is one of the cutest things I've ever seen. The look of pure contenment and trust on the bird's face when he nuzzles back is precious.
Hot. Man. 😍
My bird used to bite me painfully in the ear.
Aww, super cute birb

Also guy looks like Thor and Hopper (Stranger Things) had a baby
Hopper?
I’m pretty sure we just witnessed this guys heart melting
Thank you so much for that
Uh...could I like maybe borrow some karma? I think you have enough
I think nobody said this but the hooman’s reaction was pretty genuine and adorable too.   Love overload from the birb.towards the Hooman.
Isn't he the guy from stranger things
I don’t like birds.. but this makes me want one.  Now!
You guys are adorable... just saying
Young Jim Hopper from stranger things 😂
You can see the moment the bird melts his heart
Pretty sure he was trying to eat the hooman
This guy loves the birb as much as the birb loves him! What a sweet duo. Thank you for the lovely uplift for the day ❤️❤️❤️
Never seen this before. This made my day
That beard is it's personal comb

You'll do well to keep it nice for em
Why do you look like hopper?
Fuck off with the baby talk. It's ridiculous.
Best reaction to the birb-y snuggles. Right in the feels.
I'm not the biggest pigeon fan but that's super sweet!
Bird

Human
I really want a bird, that’s so cute.
The guy looks like Dexter
Oh. my. gosh... <3
smol dinosaur and man are Friends
This is fuckin adorbs!
I can't hear anything. Dang, this looks super cute.
birds aren't real.
That kawaii blush by the dude, its adorable.
*human
Instant downvote for those who use "hooman."
He protecc

But most importantly




He loves you bacc

Omg i think he nearly cried!
My blue crown is a lover too

This makes me so happy inside. Thank you
Jim Hoppers and his trusty sidekick.
My future pets will be a good boi and a smol bird
If Hopper had a son
So sweet!
parrots kinda freak me out a bit, but this is really cute.
Awwwww
This is the most adorable thing
Sheriff Hopper,  of Hawkins, Indiana👮🏼‍♂️
My conure likes to clean my ears. Like she gets in there. Best q tip ever.
This is so sweet❤️i have a pet pigeon and if i did this he’d bite my lip.
Oh my goodness... that is the sweetest thing...
What kind of bird is this? Looks like a Senegal but the coloring seems off...any local bird people know?
You look like a young Hopper
This is just so adorable <3 I watched it 4 times
Why can't mine love me like this. All the Tsundere... smh me jealous
Was expecting a trained response where the bird nibbles in imitation of a kiss.

Got something much much sweeter.
Awwww 🤗🤗🤗🤗
I love this so much!!
I can’t deal with so much cuteness! Send help.
My lil kitty loves when I give her face kisses (◠‿◠✿)
r/partyparrot
Tom Brady and David Harbour fused!
Barb look like Ari
Imma fucking cry. Why can't we all be this good to each other?
Awwwwwww
Avian bird flu comes to mind watching this.
I love them both so much
He's comin right at us!!!!
So sweet!!! Adorable.
I had a Quaker parrot be he died as soon as I got him
I love that it matches his hat.
I need a woman who loves me as much as this bird loves this dude.
Oh my god. This is the cutest shit I have ever seen 😍
This is too much. Darling.
If I had ovaries, they'd be exploding right now
Calm down, you love birds
He gonna make a grown man cry :')
I kind of freaked out a little bit when it was pecking near his eye.
You look like a young Chief Hopper
Welcome to the WORST show on television!
Two seconds later, it pecked his eyes out.
Hopper?
You must be a wonderful human!
Birds are incredibly loving creatures. Except crows. Don’t fuck with motherfucking crows.
I had a Quaker parrot, when I was younger,  that was affectionate like this. He was my best friend through highschool. I would keep him out of his cage from the time I got home from school until bedtime. I miss that little fucker. RIP Peekaboo.
He even fixed his hair i can't
Technically /r/brushybrushy
“Awww shucks” the bird, probably
What a dear little bird.
Our cruisers can't repel cuteness of that magnitude!
This is the most precious thing ever omg
'While I'm here, I'ma groom your feathers a little.'
My galah does this. Apparently our scruffy faces are good for scritching.
Dang it...my dog doesn’t do this.
I’d say birds are on the same level of man’s-best-friendliness as dogs
Dusky?
AWW YEAH THAT'S THE STUFF!
It'd be pretty tough to take a pirate seriously if his bird was doing this. Like, are you really going to "hang my bowels from the rafters of the ship" cause the bird doesn't seem to think you have it in you.
🥰😍 What a sweet little parakeet.🦜
I remember trying to do this with my bird when I first managed to hold him. I now have a big ass scar down my cheek.
Lovely🥰
Lovely🥰
Is this why pirates had parrots?
That almost brought a tear to his eye.
You both made the universe smile ❤️
I thought it was Jim Hopper from Stranger Things at first. Double take.
I had a blue one that would do the same thing but except she would rub her beak against my nose. So cute.🥺
The level of Awww on his face was just adorable
Kinda looks like David Harbour
Aww ;0; he loves you
Animals are so heartwarming
the universal "my pet just did something way too cute" face
D'AWWWWWW
You’re both so sweet !!
So cut😊
Hopper, is that you?
You look familiar. Well, peace.
I love his reaction.
Why can't I watch it? Wont load for me
Eee! Another dusky conure! I have one, and this one looks just like mine. 💚
I had a Dusky conure just like this and his favorite thing in the world was doing this. He could hone in on any imperfection like a bump or tiny scab and try to preen it. Guys if you have a conure don’t give him fabric based sleep huts or fleece blankets. He had those since he was hatched. At 10 he developed a stomach blockage due to ingesting fibers from his hut and blanket. $2k vet bill and dead bird.
**JAQUES? IS THAT YOU??**
CRYYIJGBGBBGBG
Are you David Harbour’s long lost love child?
Totally adorable!
I totally see why pirates had parrots.
PRECIOUS just PRECIOUS.!
Cutest thing I’ve ever seen aww.
I knew Hopper survived
I had a sun conure who did this. They're very affectionate birds.
Awwww
Just watched birdbox and I can’t handle birds right now,sorry
Okay. That’s just adorable
Oh my gosh I miss my Quaker parrot!! They’re so darn funny and sweet! My little guy used to say “hey come here, come on...gimme a kiss” and make smooch noises at me until I’d come over to pick him up.
Aaaaw, I‘d love to be that ~~bird~~ guy right now 🥰
Wow he looks like young Hopper from stranger things.
Reminds me of Hopper
Awwww!  When did Hopper get a bird, though?
Sweeet!
u/littlecj04
I had a quaker parrot that did this. I loved that bird.
Protect him at all costs. Such a sweetie.
aweeee
Too fuckin cute
I didn't know birds could turn into cats
This is literally the sweetest thing ever.
The way that man reacts is so cute
I love animals. Dogs and cats usually warm right up to me and I become best buds in seconds. Birds, however, always see me as bird satan. I don’t know why. Maybe I give off a vibe or scent they hate. No matter how nice or non threatening I am, they’ll go apeshit around me. 

I love birdies, wish they didn’t hate me so much 😑
I knew Jim Hopper wasn't dead!
😍😍😍
My heart just melted
Awwww!
such a cool bird. he never would shit on your shoulder.
My sun conue bites my ear, other than that i love the guy
Hopper is living his best life
Like a young Hopper.
I love how he thought about it for a second, then was like okayyyyy yes I love you too
I would cry
Had a conyer growing up. Theyll love on you but it can switch to attack mode at the drop of a hat.
Is this a young Jim Hopper?
Looks like a Senegal, I miss mine, he was an awesome friend. I named him Groucho, since when he got wet he would get these huge brows that reminded me of Groucho Marx. 

Thanks for the memory
best friend forever
Just a couple of sweeties being in love 😍
Awwwwwww 😍
So adorable I just can't stand it.

Oh, there's a bird in the frame, too!
Bird - hey don't fucking spit on me!

*Rubs spot back on owners face*

Haha! Now feal my rath as I pull your thin feathers off!!
That is one well cared for and loved birdie!
That bird "loves" him, no doubt.
CUTENESS OVERLOAD!! 🤯🤯😁😁💕💕
Bird nibbles should be a spa treatment. Very relaxing.
I'm just curious. Why don't these birds flight away?
Aww that is so sweet!!
It’s a so cute!!!
That reaction.  😩😍
Ded
Dusky conure?
I love this ❤
Aww❤
*r u b h e a d*
You look like Jim Hopper
Love it!
You made my day
Being preened by a small parrot is great.
I’m pretty sure he is just wiping his kisses off.

My kids have perfected this move.
Hey, I'm Vince!
So sweet!
Cute uwu
Is that hopper?
He is about to cry
I had to give this some coins 😍😍 so cute
[elephant fresh](https://youtu.be/C6wOiTJZT-Y)
Hopper, is that you?
Nice
I wish I was that bird
where do you find this kind of love??
Stranger wings
The look on the mans face, you can pinpoint the exact second his heart melts
That is so sweet
He didn't bite 😱😂
Daweeeeeee! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Your a good man
Don’t know who’s cuter, the birb or him!
Gosh so nice to see the emorion of tht birb😘
😍
My dad used to have a conure like this one.  He used to like picking apart my hemp necklaces (back when they were relatively cool).
That's true romance, you see birb tucking loose hair behind ear at the end?
Adorable!
That is fucking cute!
Wholesome 👍
Dude looks like Ryan Haywood and Jim Hopper had a baby.
My heart just melted... and by the look of his face so did this guys! This is sooo unbelievably cute
That’s true love!!
I love how he just takes a split second after you kiss him and is like “alright, we’re doing this now?” and then starts rubbing his head on your cheek
Making me miss my jenda conure.. aaaaa so fucking cute
De-liced onto his face.  Adorable
Hal, I miss you
Omg 😻
How sweet!! You made my day.
Are you sure that's not a cat?
They're sassy af but they're such sweethearts. ❤
Him and I made the same face! Ugh too cute
r/birdsarentreal
the girls of the world do what? they melt
I wanna be you 😢
Hopper?
Awe, I miss my bird now.
Aww how sweet
omg 😭 I simply cannot
Wholesome AF
Awwww I had a bird like that , Henry. Biggest mush ever.  So cute.. this made my day 🤘
So cute 😭
Congrats on all of the trim slay.
Anyone else’s significant other do this frequently? Asking for a friend
Awe.
What a pretty bird!
🥰
Cuuuute
..........maybe...  Nicholas Tesla wasn't as crazy as I thought.
If this conure is like my Tiel that bird loves her man more than life itself. They're good birds.
Blue crowned conure?
This kinda stuff makes me want a bird. Then I think about how annoying they must be and change my mind
Is that a young Hopper from Stranger Things?
A local guy in my home town walks the streets with his bird.. everyone knows him.
That guy looks like my old dealer
Used to have a conure who would do this. Super affectionate birds. Very awesome haha. Guy literally looks like he might cry from that snuggle haha.
Pets are better than EVERYONE
My parrot does this to me and it is one of the best feelings in the world
That is the cutest thing I've ever seen 😍😍
Your Swedish. Yes i know im god.
I always wondered if pirates wore eye patches from a parrot attack?
R/birbmasterrace
Nice
AWWWHHH 😍 hes so cute!!....the bird. I totally meant the bird.
"No, Marge. He's *grooming* me!"
Yup, he’s an attractive man.
An actual Disney princess
Hopper?
I want to marry a man who loves birds. Not any other kind of pet. Specifically birds.
This guy is a blonde Hopper from “Stranger Things”
He loves that damn bird!
Anyone else thinks he looks like Jim Hopper from Stranger Things?
Oh how precious!  I would love a bird like that ❤️❤️❤️
He looks like Chris Pratt...
I loved it when my bird would pick at my hair. Always felt so nice.
Ohhh I’m so blown away by both of them . Such a cutie pie what a adorable little bird 😘
Adroable
Too bad animals are nicer than people
WHOLESOME
I'm jealous.  I had two love birds who would have made me deaf in that ear and then proceed to bite the hell out of it.
They loved each other a lot and tolerated me.
This is what love looks like 💚
Super extra adorable.
I thought he/she was also going to pluck your eyebrow a mere second there.
He looks like he's gonna cry, this is so sweet 😍😢
I love birds
Young Hopper and El

That has got to feel. So cute.
That man was about to cry lol
You must have a lot of bugs in your face right there
The guy looks so happy when the bird nudges him!!! So cute.
And all he can think abt is "I'm a fucking Disney princeeeeesss". That's just adorable.
True love
When did Jim Hopper get a bird?
Love your bird loving you.
I didn’t know Dale Earnhardt Jr had a bird
Cute til it takes your eyeballs for the laugh.
"No I don't love you, I just have an itch, and your stubble makes for a good scratcher."
❤️ love this!
The look once *the bird rubs his face on him...it's like he could burst with happiness. So sweet.
my heart is melting watching his heart melt
It's eating the little things you can't see.
Lowkey looks like Hopper
Nice Jim Hopper
This makes me so unreasonably happy <3
I wonder how that feels. I know the softness of my cat and the floof of a doggo, but i wonder how it compares.
This makes me wonder if there was a breed of dinosaur that would have made a great pet.
Can anyone please tell me, will these little birds poo on you if you have them on your shoulder like that? do they just go in their cage or can they poo on your shoulder often.
All the awwwwwwws
True love!!
Is that you Hopper?
Oh! I love it!
You're so loved!
"Did you just kiss me?? Disgusting!" *tries in vain to wipe kisses off*
Yo we're twins
She tucked his hair behind his ear. That’s true love.
I fucking love birbs but I have a cat that I also love 
:(
I LOVE YOU, I GROOOM YOU, KIISSSES!! Xoxox adorbs birdie💜
 I'm not crying, you're crying. 😭😍
The epitome of awwwww
I'd do the same thing as that birdie.
Goddammit take my upvote
Awwwww
Awww 😍❤️😭
No your crying
Oh my gosh this is amazing.  Now I want a bird.
And smoochy boochy to you too!
And he 'pins' his pupils so they're really small...
bird looks like its grooming you for ticks or something, very cute
A D O R A B L E !!!!  I want one!
I want a pet bird. What species are best for friendships like this?
*Random need for a bird intensifies*
awwww, so adorable :3
Anyone thinks he looks like a cleaner David Harbour?
birds arent real
Can
Awww! I love this! 🥰 My Sun Conure Ninja likes to groom my eyelashes and rubs his face and beak on my face, then nibble my ears..tickles a lot, then you just wait for the CHOMP on the earlobe..😬
I'm saving this shit
What bird is that?
So... Now I want a bird
What a sweet birb ❤️❤️❤️
>!Cute birb!<
Isn’t he supposed to be saving Hawkins from aliens and Russians?
Young Jim Hopper is that you?
What is he doin? Is he actually given him lovins or is this like a bird grooming type thing?
Here we see video of patient 0 when the bird flu jumped to humans and wiped out 30% of the global population.
Love seeing stuff like this
I miss my budgie..
Ohhhh there goes my heart. Thank you, OP.
R u from Netflix show Stranger Things?
Awwwww! So adorable 💕💕💕
Damn, over 100 thousand internet points!

 All the birds I work with are assholes. I'm glad to see there are nice ones

oh my god your birb loves you so much ❤️😭

on an unrelated note, i’m totally single with 3 birds.
I’ve never wanted to be a bird before now. 😍😘
So darling!!
Doesn't get any better than this. Pure affection.
His face literally spells “Awwwwww”
best thing ive seen today
I would literally cry.
Well that's adorable!
Could someone give me some info about this bird? What's the species name? I'd love some company in my lonely apartment but I know some parrots can outlive their owners and I'm not sure I'm ok with that commitment
Aehhhh cute
That is absolute affection
Omg bird tucks human’s hair behind his ear! So loving :)
This is like Pretty Pastel Please and Archie. If Archie was less screechy and less letmeputmyfeetinyoureyes
This guy low key looks like chad smith
Anyone know what bird that is?
Jim Halpert - Gone native. The film of the book
That is lovely to see ❤️
The best thing I've seen today!
My bf sent me this last night and I couldn't contain the squeel of cuteness.
AWWWW!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍💜

THE most adorable thing on the net. Pure emotion ♡
This is from 9 days ago u/herowolff
Need sound 😭❤️
Hopper?
Oh, my birb.
awwww
aw
So
Who is this guy, he is HOT
this is my new favourite post
Thank you birb
Drones are learning empathy?
Cutest thing I’ve seen on Reddit.
Birb’s hooman is a looker too! 😏
"How dare you kiss me in these lands, HoOmAn? Okay, I love you too."
I kind of expected the outcome yet I was suprised!
I didn't know hopper had a birb.
This made my year. Adorable.
Never had an animal more obsessed with me than a quaker parrot
Gives ya the feels. Animals know and I’m sure the beard felt good for the birb ☺️
That birb stole my heart. So sweet. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I luv birbs. Had a cockatiel when I was a kid. They're so smart and aware. I'd love to have another but they deserve more time than I can offer currently
His face of pure joy when his birb loves on him right back....adorable!

I don't know if he is single or not, but after this video, the girls on here should snatch this boy right up!
I don't know what this mouth shit is, but this is how we say I love you in birb.
Lucky birb
I love birbs
Can confirm, that is a lovable hooman
I wish my birb loves me that much. Look at the joy of that mans face.
Man, it does really seem like he was returning the affection. I didnt know birbs did that
I love you... birb.
I ain’t ever gonna stop loving you.... birb.
birbs r the best
I thought we said we were done saying hooman. Fuckin /r/cringe
r/upvotebecauseboy
I now want to have a pet birb🤗
The fk is a hooman. Why are so many reddit people incapable of spelling lmao. Doggo, pupper.... the fks wrong with you idiots.
It looks like he was about to cry! That's adorable!
I'm caught between how adorable this is and how much I hate that people clip the wings of birds to sell them, and thereby deny the birds the freedom of flight.

It's just my opinion but birds should not be pets. Denying them the freedom of flight is cruel.

But I at least this one's happy... right? *insert shrug of uncertainty*
Who knew? Birbs show love? This is the sweetest
Lol I JUST came back from a post on one of the Arrowverse subreddits, so with that on the mind, the first thought when I saw this guy was "Holy shit that's Stephen Amell! He has a cute parakeet or whatever that is!"

I was wrong, that's not Stephen Amell unfortunately
Man theyre making birds seem more real and real... 

I almost believe a drone could love in this one.

obligatory /s
Lol that birb is like “ohh you so handsome, here let me fix you up”
I cried a little , am i gay? Or just suicidal ?
People who say birb make me sick
What is a "Hooman" that is cringey
This hoomans face staring at me feels weird.
young david harbour ?
Birb gave 3000x more luvies
Birbs are some of the greatest pets to have. Every day after I get back from work, my birb can hear me walking up the steps to my apartment and will start getting restless just out of excitement to see me and play. So wholesome OP ❤️
Love this birb and love your genuine reaction💓😭
Song birb
Oh God. How absolutely gorgeous are you? Oh and the birb too of course.....seriously there’s no better love or affection than that you give and receive from your Feathered or Fur  Babies, is there. Doesn’t it just make you melt.😍😍
😍I hate birds but I love this.
You can see the exact moment when hooman heart melts
What brand of birb is this? Cockatiel?
I love it when the birb goes "daamn dude,  I love you too"
Nuzzle1, nuzzle2,  nuzzle3... 
*Infinite  pecks!*
F.Y.I I own this exact breed, and they're not affectionate like at all, almost NEVER.

They are in fact however incredibly easily agitated and willing to bite for no reason.
I want to like it, but you remind me too much of an ex both physically and his weird connection with his bird.
Love you too.


Hmmm, i wonder if I can eat you.....
How do adult "hoomans" still think they sound cute or original doing this dumb meme baby talk? The bird is smarter than you.

Please don't type like a fool. Grow up.
My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stakeಠ_ಠ. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway.( ✖ _ ✖ )
Use your big boy words.
Not gonna lie, I never understood what Birb meant for a long time. I always thought it had something to do with Trailer Park Boys because that's how everyone pronounces "Barb".
hate to shit on this, but don't birds have very primitive basically dinosaur brains and are basically incapable of affection like this?

isn't the bird probably just enjoying the feel of the guy's beard?

edit: I'm wrong and stupid and should die.

I would feel so weird and awful keeping an animal who can soar above the sky in small cage inside of a house. 

That said the bird is cute and seems to have really embraced Stockholm syndrome.
Cute video. Chill with the cringe baby talk for animals
Birds are not capable of         “Love”
Birds aren't very manly pets. They're just good for target practice. You need a good hound by your side.
Oh look. Another no content post by a bearded hipster gets defaulted to the front page.

Next week on Reddit: 

Kittens popping out of hipster beards... Tune in.
