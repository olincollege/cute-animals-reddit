That lookback is like "see, I taught him that."
This is OC.

“Zuo Xia” means sit in Mandarin
What a good helper!
Love the older dog (proudly?) looking back at the camera after the little one succeeds! 😸
Surely the big dog got a treat next right?
This is the most feelgood vid I have seen all week. Thanks!
Oh my goodness!  I'd be in a permanent state of cuteness overload meltdown watching these two together!  

The good boi's pride is adorable once the pup finally gets it!  ❤  What a lucky puppy this one is!
sitting dog: "you seein this sh\*t?... he ate MY treat!"
"See, I told you I could show the new kid"
“Boop my nose oh wise elder”🙌🐶🐕
WHERE'S MINE? I HELPED. MUCH BETRAYAL. WOW.
Been thinking of getting a puppy, but decided to get an older shelter dog first to help train the pup. Growing up we always had 2 dogs and the older one would always help train the younger
That dog is giving paw with the expectation of a treat. Doesn't get one and looks back like WTF. lol That's probably what's happening here.
Spent the whole video worried you were going to end up being naked.
u/savevideo
My family dog de bordeaux tries to teach my 2 pugs how to give paw but it never works
Beautiful dogs man 😭😭😭
Looks like a Doge..
lookback like “where’s my treat? i did all the work”
Such a good boy!
In the end looking at the camera like “You sure you got that?”
I need to know that the big dog got a treat too.
\[looks back\] "See what I did here."
If you do the verbal and physical cue at the same time they learn alot slower, verbal cue first, physical second. Treat or marker has also to be given with in 1 second or they learn alot slower
omg that good boy look in the camera :)))
Shibas are the best. I love this
It's cute and all, but the older dog is no doubt trying to shake since sitting isn't getting it a treat.  I'm guessing sit is frequently followed by shake with the older dog.
Wow amazing
"Listen to the Boss Boi. He gives good snacks"
I love Shibas so much I could die. His proud look at the end too :3
Lol! The way he looks back.
“See I told you”
So proud
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!! OMG MY MEERA DID THE SAME THING FOR THE NEIGHBOR PUP!!! She helped her learn to walk on a leash and to paw the door to go out for potty! So awesome!
"Ok now put your butt on the ground for a snack, i said your bu- there you go."
The way the big one looks back and is like “ Yeah, did you see that, yep I told him to do that!” Is so cool!
The big goodest boy deserves a treat too! 🤗
The "this guy" look at the end
What breed are they?
Ahhhhh so sweet!
Doge
I hope older doge gets to enjoy a treat as well
“Yo, you see that? That was all me =]”
Damn, that's adorable.
The older dog turning and looking at the camera like "I think he's getting it".
I see yeah, I got this. This will be ok.
"I told you he's smart"
Train a dog to sit, he'll for a treat

Train a dog to teach a dog to sit....
This is so cute
I love how the bigger dog just booped the smaller dog on the nose so he can sit
I love how the older one looks at the camera, they look so proud
Hes like," hey I got him to sit wheres my treat?!"
"i did good right??"
My pup joe did this for our new puppy. I wouldn't hand out treats until everyone was sitting and he got tired of waiting haha.
The David Blaine stare after he gets him to sit
The look back like "wheres my treat now"
Older dog- See what I did there?
Doge Coin Doggo is smart! 😆
"Hey bro, sit down and you get a num num"
Good lil helper!
Good parenting??
So cute
Good doge
Why doesn't the big one get a treat too? 😹 He should get 2!
The big guy is so proud
Did that dog just Jim Face to the camera at the end?
Doggo looks back like “y’all get that? Got it? Yes? That was me. “
The look back, “i done good!”

Yes. Yes, you did.
He boop the snoot!
i had worse teachers in HS.     

those are 2 beautiful dogs.
My older dogs were a great help in house-training the young pups. It made it so much smoother when the young dogs could watch the older ones go outside to do their business and copy them. It's nice.

"Here, kid, let me show you the ropes."
#GOOD BOYSsssssss
Oh my God. I wish my Shiba was that chill
They're both so cute!  Give the teacher a treat too, please.
Dogecoin.. is that you???
Big brother be looking like "i dont get paid for this shit"
Shibes are the best kind of dogs 🐕
Aww! That so wholesome. I am currently retaking a Chinese class, so I too am teaching my lil pup commands in mandarin
He’s like, “it’s quicker if I teach you”
Being a Shiba parent, all I can see is the older dog being like “listen up you tiny shit, outta my way so I can get that treat! **bop”
“See what I did there?”
Lol "You see that? I made that happen"
What an angle. I thought the dude was in the *nude*
That's so cute, we got a 2nd aussie recently. Watching the 1 year old play gently with our 12 week old puppy, let him win in tug of war, etc has been really sweet.
It was the look back that did it for me.
That is one Professional Good Boy. 😲🤯😍
THE WAY HE LOOKED AT THE CAMERA AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH
Dogs teaching dogs to seat?! I can’t even teach my dog to stand without falling over.

This makes me happy
You only need to train one dog then that dog will teach all the other dogs.  Ez pz
This is so cute!!!
*looks back at camera*

"Am gemius"
The look: hey where snacko for teacher??
Awesome.
“You fool, sit so we can get treats!”

“See...  wait <looks back> I get one too, right?”
Getting a puppy while you still have an older dog is such a great idea. New puppy will try to emulate older puppy and older puppy will always try to play with new puppy. Well done and they are both adorable.
I have a white shiba that I rescued when she was 8. She's 14 now. I wish I got to experience the puppy phase.
Good Doge
Good boi teaching little boi to also be good boi :)
“Bruh, come on.  We don’t get the treat ‘til you do the thing”
When he turned back to the camera I knee-jerk said good boy
That look back, "I raised that boy."
I can't handle this it's too cute
Bigger doggo- “yea, I did that”
Instructions unclear... invested all my money in Dogecoin
awwwwwww
This is why it's a good idea to get a younger dog (cats too) while your older dog is still doing most of their normal stuff. The older dog will help a lot with training the younger one. This won't work if you have a reactive dog that's not good with other animals, in that case just let them live the rest of their lives in peace.
That gentle paw and guidance.  What a gentle soul.  ❤️
Big pupper: Yo behave we get snacks

Little one: oh okay
To the moon!
Dog looked back and was like "Yeah, I just did that."
Doge knows, doge share wisdom
Hell yeah
Give him some Dogecoin
🚀🚀🌑 💎🐾 GOOD DOGE!

Good dad
The way he/she turns around smiling is so great.
Videos that end perfectly.
All I could think of is Doge Coin and Mini Doge Coin 🪙
Give doggo dogecoin!
That look at the end :)
The big one looks like doge lol
Shiba inu?
Wow😍
That's super adorable.
he booped the snoot and looked at you like *I did dis*...
What kind of dog is the big pup? He/she looks a lot like ours, who is a mix and we're not sure exactly what she is! Such a cutie.
I want a shiba so badly
he’s like lol where’s my treat tho?
Is your dog named Jim Halpert? The resemblance is uncanny.
And he looks so pleased with himself.
I really miss my Shiba...
That’s awesome
passing on the knowledge
Awww and the bigger doggo looks so proud. Look what I did 😍
HEs like you better sit down. smart dog... I want one!
Meanwhile my dog literally just spazzes out until you give him a treat
Damn u kinda sexy doe 😳
Doge 😂😍
Its Doge!
So proud!
I really love animals affectionate.
Where’s my treat though?!
See, I did it!!!
This is just so adorable
Sheba’s no less! Awesome!
Cute and smart😊
Love the paw boop to sit.  The looking back is priceless.  See I got him to sit!  I did it!  ❤️❤️❤️
Older dog: "He's slow, you know, but he's got a good heart."
DOGE!
"You're embarrassing me in front of the wizards"
Wow,you have a clever 🐕 there. That saves you having to train the young one.
OMG !!!!

I Am In Love 
I will love them ... It's so cute ever 🤓😍😍😍😍.❤️.❤️. 

Dogs is really something amazing and soo cute 



Love Them 😝❤️😍❤️
Very clever
cute
BS he’s asking for the treat
I had cute cat which we have been taking care for months. Suddenly it got sick and died, don't know what happened. But the good news is she gave us cute dughter befor she left. Now we are taking care of him.
The Doge was like, yea now gimme mine.
Doge
The dog is probably like “that idiot took like 3 minutes to sit while I sat instantly, AND HE GOT THE TREAT”

*looks back

“YOU SEEING THIS BULLSHIT”
We humans push down the butt to make a dog sit, notice how the dog swipes down in front of the nose.  Will definitely try that.
Such wow.
Dogecoin 🚀
I love this video so much! Thanks for sharing.
u/farmercurtis
Get down dude, you’re gonna love it. Trust me.
Why are you naked?
“He gets a treat and I don’t?!? BULLSHIT”
That cream shiba could literally be my dogs cousin.
Older dog is so proud and I of him!
Hate to be the one to say that the big dog is just also giving it's paw trying to get the treat. It's not teaching the little dog to sit
Big pup: No, you have to sit, do it like this.

Small pup: I want the snack

Big pup: but you have to sit. Sit. Sit.

Small pup: Okay, I sit.

Hooman: Good boy, here's snack.

Big pup looks back to other hooman: See, what I did. We are good boi's.
Is your dog David Blaine?
Wait till Elon Musk watched this!
Everyone else: "aww cute dog"
Me: why isn't he wearing a shirt?
[deleted]
why is this guy only in his underwear?
Shibe
My dog is dumb as hell, but he also does this when he’s sitting besides another dog and treats are being handed out. It’s less training, and more “point this other dogs food hole away from the feed man”
That is adorable!
What a smart dog!!
Ma he did it!! We can keep it 😂
Shheeeeebbbbbssss ❤️❤️❤️
🤩🤩

Big dogo needs a treat!!!
How good are dogs at learning through immitation? It would make sense to me if a dog more readily identified patterns through observing other dogs rather keeping track of it's own movements.
Those are such handsome dogs, what breed are they?
u/savevideo
Shiba inu very intelligent , healthy and long lived and a wonderful companion.
So a downward nose push is the command to sit in dog language?
Soooooo cute 😭😭
The older dog looks back like “ya like that huh?”
So cute!
What a good big sibling!

What a good big brother... but don’t forget to give him a treat too. He so deserves it! ❤️
Oh huh.  This is what our dog trainer did to teach our pup to sit: a little downward boop along their nose.
All me - doggo.
This brightened up my day! 💕
The look back is "how come I didn't get a treat?"
I like how the older dog looks at the camera at the end like " did you get that"
That might be the cutest shit I’ve ever seen.
Mother dog knows the drill.
Felt more like "give me not him"
That look back is so fuckin sly

Camera person must've randomly said, "Supdawg." because that dogs facial expressions said, "What's up, dawg?".
“Look ma, I teached him!”
So stinkin cute!
Also my dogs do this a lot for my foster dogs. It's. Awesome.
Where is his treat? !
I have an adult lab and a younger adult lab shepherd mix. The mix will start to lose his mind and makes silly shepherd rawr noises and flop into her and nibble her shoulder if his sister is being too lazy to do a trick. He knows he has to wait until they both do it.
Is that actually dog language for another dog to tell a dog to sit? If I tap a dog on the nose that way will he understand sit?
Is anyone gonna mention the guy is in his underwear?

The look back like, you see what I did...?

Repost!
Use a fist. Palm to the nose. You can literally push on their nose to force a sit.
