Here's the larger 49 second video where the orange kitten jumps into the ring.
For god's sake tag him in already! You're going to die in there!
did you get a little folding chair to throw in there?
Please don't let them climb on top of a cage. One of them is sure to get thrown off into the announcers table.
ROYALE RUMBLE!!!
"Ladies and Gentlemen, now introducing the GORGEOUS KITTIES OF WRESTLING!!"
Oh my! The Ginger Gentleman has now snuck into the arena and is interfering in the match! Why is the referee allowing this!? He's got Captain Fantastic by the leg and is biting his Achilles tendon! This is just the worst, lowest display of bad sportsmanship in all my years announcing wrestling! Who will stop this!? When will the referee notice!?
Mah God, he broke him in half!
These kittens could've been real Wrestlemania wrestlers.  They have the moves and more importantly, the back fur.
this is the most adorable thing ever!
Already more entertaining than the past 5 years of WWE.
Where's the ref? The kitty is clearly attacking the tail when not tagged in.
BY GAWD
HE'S DEAD! SOMEONE STOP THE DAMN MATCH!
I want to hear the narration of this match so bad!
BAW GOD! 

THAT KITTEN HAS A FAMILY!
Put Jim Ross's voice over this
My cats have been playing with one of these since 1998,  when Scar  threw Mufasa off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
r/AnimalTextGifs here ya go.
I would like to buy a kitten for $2.
Finally; REAL wrestling üôÇ
If you're op be sure to watch them whilst it's out, heard bad stories about tensioned strings and cats.
This is the type of wrestling I‚Äôd actually get into.
WATCH OUT WATCH OUT WATCH OUT!!!
You need to get another kitten in there for a tag team!
Seriously, this made my day. Thank you!
Catslyvania....

...I'll go now
Can someone put some WWE commentary over this?
WHISKERS IS GOING TO WRESTLEMANIA!!!!
This will be burried, but make sure you always supervise them around that. They can swallow an elastic or strangle themselves.
 Neighborhood kittens strangled themselves in our soccer net growing up. It was terrible.
Sting?
But don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
If ginger kitty left over the top rope he's being a bit of a heel ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Ginger cat being a textbook heel manager with that outside interference
Stone Cold Steve Awwwwstin
A lot better than a Baron Corbin match
u/vredditshare
How is this not a thing already
ECW! ECW!
u/vredditshare
BAH GAAWWD HE HAD A FAMILY!
The best use of thrift store junk is to make things for your kids and/or pets. I don't get people buying new all the time. I guess it's a status thing...

Great work, that's awesome!
First licensed program for /r/pan right here.
This is more entertaining than that crap that passes as wrestling.
Bah gawd that cat has a family!
Someone needs to dub a wrestling announcer over this
Please put this to JR commentary
WHO WILL WIN? GENERAL MITTENS OR POM POM THE SLAYER?
Can someone more talented than me, do a voice over transcribing the fight like WWE. Please. I need it.
Where do people find this cool stuff at their thrift stores? My local shops just have ugly clothes, dusty furniture, and old board games with missing pieces.
Guys don‚Äôt believe them wrestling is big fake
Someone needs to add WWE commentary  to this.
Tonigth we are going to witness the most anticipated match in the history of  professional wrestling, for the fluffiestweigt championship tittle of the world, procastination fans are you ready?, for the thousand in attendence and the millions watching from around the world, from the living room of some random guy in the internet, ladies and gentleman, lets get ready to rumble!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please.  PLEASE.  Someone edit in JR doing ringside commentary for this.
I'm just here waiting on u/shittymorph
Yeah I can see one of those kittens getting its neck caught in the ropes and twisting around in panic and suffocating if they're left unsupervised. Please make sure you put that thing where they can't get at it when you're not there to supervise.
"Lemme at 'em, lemme at 'em!!"
And white tail is the King of Royal Tumble.
This is exactly why the internet was invented.
Someone needs to add a Jim Ross sound track to this...
If that kitten gets on the top rope he‚Äôll be unstoppable
The kitten in the back is fighting its own wars
If someone added in the audio from any WWE event it would probably match up perfectly!
KITTYMANIA IS RUNNING WILD BROTHER!
This was the day that snowball threw fluffy fifteen centimeters off the top of the ring as the audience cheered.
Shawn Meowchaels or pawtista or mr. Purrfect or purrt angle or finn prowler. Theres more I'm sure.
u/vredditDownloader
MR MITTENS WE AGREED YOU KEEP IT IN THE RING. YOU COULDNT KEEP IT IN THE RING BROTHER SO SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE CIVIC CENTER....
Two kittens enter. One kitten leaves
I would watch a livestream of this.
"Ladies and gentlemen...LET'S GET READY TO RUMBULLLLLLLLLLLLE!"
My six year old daughter had been daydreaming about making this happen. Thank you for fulfilling her birthday wish!
I would pay to watch this live.
Can we get an entire channel with animals playing sports? We can call it ESPNmew
u/MPKallday
Can someone dub an announcer?
I could watch this all day
OH MY GAWD HE GIVE'S EM THE PAW!
What the hell is texas tornado doing out the ring. Straight up getting counted out.
GIVE HIM THE CHAIR!!
Yes, I am entertained
r/thriftstorehauls
Tap me in, TAP ME IN
"Tag me in! TAG ME INNNNNN!!"
I don't believe that ginger cat has a referee licence...
Get them a Tiny Folding Chair asap
Please tell us their names are Cena, Hogan, etc.
This is the cutest damn thing ever! The pound should give away mini wrestling rings to anyone adopting two kittens. All the kitties would have homes!
As amazing as this is, it could be at least 10x better with commentary
You should included some tiny folding chairs!
Ba Gawd! Somebody stop the damn match! Jr.
Better than WWE
It's fake.
I want to see this shit glued to the front page for like a week people
Best match I seen in years
Now you NEED a small chair.
u made kittens fricking wrestle . u monster .
This needs audio of JR screaming.
That orange kitty is playing dirty. Chewings on the tail and leg of the other wrestle-kitty before being tagged in. Where's the ref?!?
Terrible ref I mean you see the cat is on the ropes
Best thing I‚Äôve seen all day!
Would order the main event on pay-per-view. Please make this happen.
ƒπ
AND HIS NAME IS KITTY CENA
God as my witness that kitty is split in half! ... and is also cute
The kittens alone are priceless = infinity

Infinity + 2 = infinity

Math checks out
I would love to see someone dub WWE announcing over this
I misread this and thought you found $2 kittens at a thrift store
Kits imitate what they see on TV.
Lol I love the orange cat trying his/her hardest to help
Brother, whatcha gonna do when kittymania runs wild on you!?
..Something something mancat off hell in a cell and plumeted 2 inch deep..
This is so fake, their not even hitting each other.
Just a heads up to only have it out when your around, they can easily get twisted up in it a choke, my cat was playing with a gift bag and put head through the handle and did a roll and it wrapped around his neck and I had to get him out.
Needs music, open this in a new tab:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxQgZkWZtBE#t=10s
Cat wrestling is fake
that could go very very wrong if you leave it unattended. :( please be safe for kitties
Wrestlemeownia?
When my cat had kittens they played in my sons toy wrestling ring too. It was so much fun to watch. We would do announcers skits with them. Enjoy.
I don't even have cats anymore and yet I'm looking on Amazon and sure enough there's the Wrestlemania ring.
Awwwwww
You loved G.L.O.W., now we've brought you F.R.O.W. (Fuzzy Rascals of Wrestling)!
Super cute but I would only allow them to play in it while being supervise tbh.  

If kitty puts his head between top and middle rope and happens to tumble forward he could get caught with its lil neck twisted in the ropes.
[deleted]
awesomeness!
Dont leave the kitty's unattended with this toy the string could wrap around its neck and suffocate it
I'd throw that right into the trash, possible strangling hazard.
This is too cute for the Internet
HECK IN A CELL!

You are easily amused.

As am I.
There can be only one!
can this be a web series
This is very entertaining
Cat fight and a hissy fit.
Today for SALE!

Three kitten! two white, one Ginger (all mind condition)

And I give you a mini Squared Circle!

2$ at my thrift store!

Take it or leave it.
Amazing.
This is the best thing ever!!!
Looks like the ginger one is trying to get his team mate to sub him in. (Sorry totally incorrect wrestling terminology but you get what I mean hopefully)
Mine prefer to constantly ambush each other
3rd man in!!
The brown kitten ‚Äútag men in bro, c‚Äômon!‚Äù.

The Real WWF: World Wrestling Felines
Now do hell in a cell
Other cat ran away ... there is a clear winner
cat fight
Someone needs to dub this with wrestling commentary
Perfect fit
Needs more TLC
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!
The Ref can't handle these two.
Could earn a lot of money if this was livestreamed to twitch.
Put this on the next rpan!
I would pay $34.95 to watch this.
I'd pay $9.95 to sit and watch this!  Can we get a PPV event going?
Someone needs to put an over the top commentary over it
I want the WWE commentary to play over this
I could watch that for hours üòÜ.
The cat is against the ropes. Open your eyes ref!!
Hhh vs Mr. Ass
Someone stop the match, already! Dear God there are bodies everywhere! King, I've never seen anything like this! What a slobberknocker!
Priceless...wrestling garb on the kitties would be too much!
ksi VS logan paul
That's some nice jiu jitsu skills from the kitty at the bottom

I'd say blue belt atleast
i like how the orange cat is having it's own battle witcthe tail
We need WWE Soundeffects! Now!
This should be a Pay Per View event!
If we fits we wrestle.  Very cool !
I'm not sure you could have CGI'd that better.
Thank you for blessing us all with this.
I'm amazed they don't mangle each other.  Kittens wrestle rough!
I think you just made my wife's day. Thanks for carrying my water for a day; I'm...so tired.
Manager is clearly cheating.

I started humming "Gonna Fly Now" in my head but with "Meow meow meow meow meow meow meowüé∂".

Awesome idea.
BAW GAWD
I can hear Mean Gene speed talking about turnbuckles :)
one up top be like "Tag me! Tag me! ooooh TAIL!"
It's Cat Zingano!
Was the orange one looking for a chair/ladder
Mah clawd!
ITS ME, WHISKERS! 

IT WAS ME, ALL ALONG!
Just needs commentary
OOOOOH, THE HOOMANITY!!!
Catty little kittens
Are you ready to PRRRUMBLE?!?!
All white kitty does not respect the rope break
That is the best $2 you ever spent. =)
The new CWE
Hysterical!
Wrestle Meownia
Video ended too soon I was waiting for the cat to stand on the turnbuckle and smash back some beers
That thrift store find takes it from "awww they're playing!" to "nooo they're fighting!"
This is amazing, thank you for this
Now hit them with a table
I like the spazzy one not giving a fuck in the background
‚ÄúThe Claw will get you!!‚Äù
The orange one is just happy to be in the room
It‚Äôs not priceless, it was $2
The only cat gif worth watching
You just need to find a Mean Gene Okerlund doll to post up outside the ring.
The next season of GLOW is looking good.
Has crossover potential with /r/ThriftStoreHauls.
More entertaining than the WWE
This match looks like a "Barn-burning slobber knocker!"
If JR narrated this, my life would be complete.
This has some N64 WWE wrestling game look to it and I kinda really love it.
OFF THE TOP ROPES!!!
"Oh, this would be perfect for the kittens to battle in!"
This is amazing
WrestleManiage a trois
DEVON......... Get the tables!!!
Didn't go over the top rope, they're fine.
Please someone with talent do a "real" ringside commentary of this.
C'mon! Make the tag!
That sport was made for cats...
LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE AT THE FIRST ANNUAL KITTEN WRESTLING FREE FOR ALL!
u/shittymorph I was looking for a comment from you!
Orange manager kitty with the interference
Can‚Äôt upvote enough!
Where‚Äôs Jim Ross to narrate this?
you need to get a cat size white/black referee shirt for the brown cat
As god as my witness, he‚Äôs broken in half!
This is the only kind of wrestling I can get into.
I think you've accidentally just started a new sport
KO. The brown one says so!
Was wishing one would pounce off the turnbuckle, but awesome gif either way.
ITS A FUCKING BLOOD BATH! CALL IT OFF, REF!!!!!!
My favorite is the orange one outside the ring, biting feet and tails.
Quick! Someone put real wrestling commentary over this!
Which network picks this up first?
Aww its Wrestle Meow-nia
They turk err jerb‚Äôs!
Get a cat tree and reenact Mankind vs. Undertaker!
He‚Äôs goin for the guillotine
Amazing fluffy I wish I had those beauties
Can somebody edit this and add WWF sound bits! I can already here The King commentating!! Lol
watch it again for the little guy in the back!
Best use of $2 I've ever seen
Actually seems like $2 to me.
In nineteen ninety eight the Fluffy threw Mittens off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.
I want to see AussieManReviews commentate this
SHOULDERS ARE DOWN! 1...2...AND A KICK OUT OUT AT 2 AND A HALF! MY GOD WHAT DOES FLUFFY HAVE TO DO TO END THIS MATCH?

INTERFERENCE ON THE OUTSIDE FROM MR SNUFFLES, DISTRACTING THE REFEREE, AND OH MY GOD WAS THAT A CLAW TO THE FACE FROM WHISKERS? REFEREE DIDN‚ÄôT SEE IT! THAT‚ÄôS SHOULD BE A DISQUALIFICATION!
ITS A CAT ROYAL RUMBLE.
AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE IS BROKEN IN HALF!!
He didn‚Äôt tag!!!   Orange never got tagged!!!
WHATCHA GONNA DO BROTHER‚ÄîWHEN CATAMANIA RUNS WILD ON YOUUUU
And his name is JOOOOOHN KITTYYYYY
Still more entertaining than a UFC match.
No selling that offense from Ginger. Terrible work rate but the gimmick is just too over with me. 4/5 stars, no Tokyo Dome.
And his name is JOHN CENA !

This needs to be on after monday night raw. Like the puppy bowl during the superbowl
Referee cat in the back is distracted by the ropes.. WE NEED A REFEREE!!!!
The best thing I‚Äôve seen on Reddit.
Where can I get one?!
Priceless is correct. Look at the cuteness of these two perfectly wrestling against the ropes, and the little orange boy in the background obviously trying to pick a side because being the odd one out he‚Äôs not sure if he should join the winner still in the ring, help the losing side falling out, or take on the ever dangerous rope rings that will ultimately always be the last ones standing in the ring. But don't let these adorable wrestlers distract you from the fact that in [1998](https://youtu.be/9hMp65SzyTU) , The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
Set out chairs and invite some friends over. NO CAT JUGGLING! /s 
A pat scrap in the ring is just fine.
Thank you
u/VredditDownloader
all wrestling is fake, except here. Because kittens...
u/VredditDownloader
Video stopped just before the lower wrestler pulled  a miniature folding scratch post out from under the ring.
If OP is not sitting there commentating while this is happening, it‚Äôs a really missed opportunity
That orange cat is gonna come in last minute after everyone forgot he hasn‚Äôt gotten thrown over and be the winner.

Bah gawd
Where is the ref? Rope means break!

"OH MY GOD!"
It's this on now Live
Wow GLOW season 3 looks good
/u/vredditshare
So cute!
Someone please record commentary over this. This is the main event and it deserves more.
So do you just place the ring in the center of the room and the kittens just naturally gravitate to it?
The ref‚Äôs having some trouble getting into the ring to break up this beat down
"OH MY GOOOD! OH MY GOOOD! HE'S GOT HIM CORNERED! THIS IS HISTORY BEING MADE RIGHT HERE!"
Laughing\*\*leettttss get ready to rumble!
And all you need is JR commentary, 'Good gawd almighty that kitten might be broken in half!!'
I love the little orange one trying to find out what the strings are
Fuck you. Take your upvote.
You are a genius.
AS¬†GOD¬†AS MY WITNESS, HE IS BROKEN IN HALF!

The orange kitten has learned that the true enemy is the situation.
The best is the one holding on to the ropes while they punch Each other
More wrestling than the first season of GLOW.
That‚Äôs so cool
Now this is a Battle Royale I can get behind.
Quake Arena..  kitten edition.
Honestly, I would watch this.
This is why I love the internet!
This would be 10x greater with Jim Ross commentating.

Adorable kittos
Is this on pay per view?
Hes gotta go over the top!
Someone needs to take this and cut in audio from WWE
There is no reason this shouldn't be an entire YouTube channel
Is Mankind going to have to throw someone over the top belt into a table?
Can we just make sure no kitty gets strangled please?

Please please please make this an ongoing series; I need more!
That is awesome!!!
Just needs some commentary and some sound effects and it's all set!
Those cheap finds can really be hit or miss for cats.  I remember many years ago that my then-neighbors were moving so they held some yard sales to get rid of stuff that would otherwise be thrown out.  I was new to having a pet so I didn't know what exactly Socks, my cat, would be interested in.  I bought some assorted shiny objects and some soft, furry ones in the hopes that he would find some of them interesting.  As it turns out, the only thing he seemed to care about was the small box I used to bring all those knicknacks over.  I miss that cat.  I adopted him back in nineteen ninety eight when the underkitten threw catkind off h–µll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.

Cute! However, please don't let them play on it unsupervised. It looks like they could easily get tangled in those ropes. When I was a little kid I woke up one morning to find two of our kittens hung themselves playing in loose fabric hanging from a lawn chair. I would hate for that to happen to these cute kittens.
Oh sure everyone loves this. But when I put 47 of them in a cage I got arrested. Kitty Thunderdome had potential!
I'd pay to see a show
White kitty gets a DQ in this match, other kitty clearly got a textbook rope break so you gotta break that hold, the refs gonna DQ you there every time
LET'S GET READY TO PURRRRRUMBLE.

Someone needs to find the perfect wrestling commentary that fits.

It exists for sure... Just gotta find it.

Tiny metal folding chairs?
Almost as good as a box.
I have kittens they do this on their little bed, but this makes it 10x better!

"Its a slobberknocker, just end the damn match already!"

I'd watch this alongside a season of Puppy Bowl.

The orange kitten is the cutest here. How is no one noticing?
I need to find some of these...
It‚Äôs perfect

What a bunch of animals
He's going to pounce on him from the top rope!
Looks to me like the aggressor is trying to lock in the mandible paw.
This will compete with the Puppy Bowl for best sporting event.
Came here for kitten hell in the cell damn it!!
Interference by the orange blazer.
Oh this is tough..... get in there buddy and help ya friend out hahaha
This is better than watching the ‚Äúreal‚Äù thing
Can someone with a manly voice commentate over this like its a real fight?
All hail the new wcw champions
 We need arbitrary back stories on each wrestler and why each dislikes the other.
I‚Äôd pay pay-per-view for this.
My cat ate the shit out of those ropes.
Someone needs to add WWF audio to this right now.
Glad to see wrestling has gone back to the Attitude era. So brutal
That orange cat is a member of the Bullet Club.
TAG ME IN!
Hes holding the ropes. Disqualify the guy holding the submission.
WWE supah slam!!
And..... She's out the ring
Looks like the ref is biased.  Last i checked a leg in the ropes means match is halted and fighters retreat to there corners.  It‚Äôs like the ref is not even watching. MAYHEM!!!
Mini Sledge hammer
He's had enough! You already kicked him out, now you reach out and punch him too.
This is easily one of the cutest things that I‚Äôve seen in the past week. üòä
Literally every cat ever.
TOPE' MEWISIDA!
That is an illegal pin. Ref should have stopped it after the rope break.
They are so very sweet.

Some WWF commentary dubbed over this would be sweet!
Siamese kittens!

And thus, the World Wrestling Kitten foundation was formed.

This isn't the entertainment we deserve, but it's the entertainment we need
Oh God,  I can hear the excitement of the fans.  What a fantastic fight!
This is the best thing I've seen all week.
The kitten outside of the ring is the manager!!!
Meow-a-mania is runnin‚Äô wild on you, BROTHERRRRR!!!!
‚ÄúTag me!! Tag me!!‚Äù
I could watch a whole series of this if someone did commentating and added effects and music. 

Hell, make up story lines. "Mittens the Great faces off against Snowball and What's THIS?!? ITS CHEETARA WITH THE CHAIR!!!"
Thrift stores don't sell cats!!
