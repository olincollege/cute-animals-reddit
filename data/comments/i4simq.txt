I think he wants a cracker on trade.
It's [Yoll the Owl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5W82toaHs8). The channel itself is dedicated to owls in general, run by a Russian woman.  


The better ones are in which Yoll delivers letters but after a 5 minute struggle finally lets go of the letter, only it to be spam.
You didn't pay him!
Oi, pay him or he'll bite you
It's 2020

It's probably a Howler
I feel like he was looking into my soul
P.S the bird bites
Your letter has arrived.. Why hasn't mine?
Am I the only one think that owl is looks like it wants a tips
GIVE HIM/HER SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE YOU MONSTER!!11
Blathers has a side hustle... he gets paid in stamps I think
Pizza delivery guy when he knows you ain't tipping himüíÄ
That was a hoot.
Let him in

That‚Äôs a chunky owl, and it‚Äôs adorable
How does one obtain an owl?
r/paythedamnowl
But why the Muggle stamps?
This gets reposted way too much, pun intended.

&#x200B;

Edit: The pun is post, as in postal.
WHY ISN'T THIS A NORMAL THING?
They did put enough stamps on, then
Dursleys must be throwing mine away.
"yOu aRe eXpeLLeD"
That‚Äôs a superb owl.
Opens letter‚Äù you have been rejected you filthy mudblood ‚Äú
"owl be back!"
Imagine giving gold to a repost
Pet the damn owl!
I know what you did last semester
I have an idea for a movie. It stars McCauley Culkin as a foul-mouthed, washed up, middle-aged barista who's Hogwarts letter arrives over 30 years late as the result of an incident involving Ted Turner and a time-turner. Now, due to the vagaries of wizarding law, he's guaranteed a magical education whether Dumbledore likes it or not.

Mostly, it would just be middle-aged Culkin shouting inappropriate things at children and misusing his magical abilities to score wizard drugs.

Also, he bangs a ghost.
Always been a huge fan of Harry Potter n it's magical world.
Legit thought this was that dumb promo for that Harry Potter game
I think some house elf is intercepting my mail
it's cute but now i can't sleep (those eyes)
Just gonna leave him out there? Invite him in for some coffee
This is a much more terrifying interaction than I pictured.
what the. how. ?
This is a repost
Congrats. What house do you hope to be sorted into?
Are those the eyebrows?
"Look man, I'm just as surprised as you are, I swear..."
That raptor seemed to expect a tip.
OP gone through a lot effort
You‚Äôre a wizard, Harry.
"You're a wizard Harry. Harry, you're a wizard." 
"But I'm just Harry."
Not gonna upvote because it‚Äôs a repost, but that‚Äôs not going to stop me from enjoying it
r/petthedamnowl
There is either too many or not nearly enough stamps on that envelope.
Ur a wizzard harry.
Does this is know that it's a federal crime to tamper with other people's mail?

Hmmmmmm?!?! üßê
What no tip?
Yer a woman, Hairy!
I have so many questions.
*You‚Äôre a wizard*
What a good boy. Just waiting for a treat.
Never happen to me. Bye.
He didn‚Äôt seem too thrilled on letting the letter go Harry. Must be something important ü§î
When I was 13, I found a small owl in the big open trash can in my parents' garage. My mom had caught it in the grille of her car driving down the road. I have jokingly referred to this as the reason I received no formal education in sorcery.
Ullooh da pattha
I need a Hogwarts lifeüòç

I wish I could get 74k useless karma from a 2 year old repost.

Whooo do you think I am?
Bro that ho looks scary asf
You're past due on your credit card payment Harry
Chonkie mail owl.
That was his letter tho, he's the one going to Hogwarts, how dare you take that away from him?
Forgot to tip him a feild mouse
I love how he looks a little more mad when the letter was taken from him
I am beyond jealous.
This is the best thing I have ever seen lol and I‚Äôm not even a Harry Potter fan
Why did you have to pay postage?
Awwwwüíñ
I need sound
Oh hell no , u aint even gonna invite me for a cup of tea when i carried ur heavy ass letter to ur house ..
With all those stamps it looks like it was sent from the Weasley‚Äôs not Hogwarts
looks so serious
You didn‚Äôt even give it a tip?! Monster...
U didn't pay her, I don't believe the poor owl :o
That's just unbelieveable...
Have u ever thought of the struggle they go through just to deliver a single letter?!?

I am disappointed and disgusted :(
Jk of course, nice vid
Owl: Maintain eye contact and hold on to the letter to show dominance.
Whaaaaa
Looks like the owl is a little jealous :)
YOLL!
He's look at you like, "Bro, no tip?"
Owl looks so angry
Too bad Hogwarts is only going to be virtual this year.
You need to tip the owl in mice.
(shuts the window) the owl like uh I guess I'll just wait here.....
What, no tip?
"Wow! Am I going to Hogwarts?!"

*"No, you're being evicted, good day!"*
Almost 32 and still waiting on my letter :(
this is why Gen Z makes fun of us
No treat for the travels?! How rude
He looks offended you won't invite him inside
Need the obnoxious version of the Harry Potter jingle and its perfect.
... we regret to inform you that your application to Hogwarts has been denied ...
It's for who who!
Owl: where's my tip?
At least pay the owl, owls have a hard time too. Maybe a head pat?
You forgot to pay him!!!!
Aww what a sweetie... Wouldn't he prefer a mouse instead though?
So what is the backstory to this video anyway
It‚Äôs customary to tip your delivery people, just saying.
He had that *gawd ask me to get in hooman* face
Gonna need some context here
Unfortunately mine wasn't admission to Hogwarts, it was just a lab result that confirmed my hog has warts.
Ummm excuse me, delivery is far from free, pay the owl! **PAY THE OWL!**
I made a hogwarts letter for my little sister on her eleventh birthday... she was so frickin happy. My life was complete after seeing that
You owe him 5 Knuts
This is Yoll from the same name YouTube channel, check it out, a lot of cute animals videos there.
Dude is seriously mad dogging you.
As that was happening I heard the tinkly theme tune in my head.
"No tip?  Avada Kedavra bitch!"
Hoooty Hoooooo Deliveryyyy
‚ÄúDear Muggle.

We are in receipt of your application and regret to inform you that unless you want to be a grumpy cat owning night watchmen, there is no room for you at Hogwarts.‚Äù

What?  We never see the rejection letters.
Let him in. LET HIM INNN
Don‚Äòt leave him outside ü•∫
This is way too awesome
Owls are just cats with wings
Dudes waiting for a tip
He seemed like he didn't want to give it up at first. absolutely love it!
Give him a knut
Cute...but that prolonged eye contact was a little unsettling. Reminds me of my sex life.
Where is his tip?!
Unlike Harry Potter owls, these owls require mice as postage charges.
Such a shame you'll have to attend online classes. Heard Hogwarts it's actually pretty nice this time of the year.
Awww
Look at those talons üò¶
You didn‚Äôt tip!
You're not even gonna offer it a cup of tea?!
A mouse is the trade here human!
Well obviously you‚Äôre not ronald weasley üòÇ
You‚Äôre a wizard Harry!
‚ÄúWhom is that from?‚Äù
‚ÄúWho‚Äù says the owl.
First you made me hold it, then you take it away?!? What's wrong with you, Marvin?!
Well, this explains why my letter never showed up
Yer a whizzer 'arrry
Here's your Howler.
Omg I want an owl!!
i do not like how soul-seeking those eyes are
Those eyes üëÄ
Literally so cute and big omgoodness

Don't be shy,let him in ü•∫
Dang no treat?
Yol the Eagle Owl!
So on a whim a few days ago, I decided to start watching the Harry Potter series start to finish.

Man - those movies *were* as good as I remember.  Crazy how they just sort of caught lightning in a bottle with those movies.
I hope you instantly re-opened the window and thanked the owl properly
It wants your dog or cat (muggle pets) if anything....
you better give that good boy a treat! right now!
What the hell are you doing, you‚Äôre supposed to give it a treat!
I want an owl soooooo bad! <3
Totally adorable, how did they train it??üíï
Owls will be forever tainted to me because of Snyder's "Court of Owls" run on Batman.

Them fuckers are spooky now.
What, no owl treat?
Mmm that years old repost flavor
Ye're a wizard Harry
Give him a Knut!
Letter: 

You're NOT a wizard sorry. Feel free to pet the owl. Seriously it will help

Not enough stamps.
Oh what the hell
Is that Yoll!?

I would give the owl a cracker and maybe head pats
Owl deserves pets. Give him the pets or else...

Give him 5 knuts! I think he brought you the Daily Prophet
*stares owlingly*

*slowly grabs package*

**staring intensifies**
That stare tho üò±
Uhm, you know you gotta pay him some wizard currency right
*Kaepora Gaebora intensifies*
Lucky! Mine was one that Voldemort destroyed... :(

"I want to watch you open it."
He's so nervous on his first day of the job
Was I the only one who heard the theme play in their head? https://youtu.be/Htaj3o3JD8I
Why would you close the window on him, at least invite him in for a snack or something
Hey buddy, how about a frozen mouse for the effort!?
so funny)
this owl's owner actually has a yt channel named Yoll, check it out
Why do I hear the celesta?
What no tip ?
Yo its yoll. So adorable.
Excuse me I believe you forgot his tip!
Rude of you not to tip em a few knuts.
Good boi doin a good job
All of my dreams in one little video
The way he was hesitant to let go and then stayed and stared, he was clearly saying ‚Äúhey asshole wheres my pay!? I aint workin for nothin out heeeea!‚Äù
...no tip?
Lol, a meme has been born
What no reward? And we wonder how we got Errol...
You didnt give him a tip?
Brown Hedwig gave a more than harder peck of the finger prior to Harry closing the door. He knew she was pissed but didn‚Äôt care, got his letter. ‚ÄúTo the Owlery you bitch,‚Äù he muttered.
hedgewick is that you :o
I would like an owl to greet me outside my window. Ive seen so many on here! How do I ask an owl do this?!??
No post on Sundays!
YOLLLLL! I love this owl. Literally the only russian videos on youtube i give a ... HOOT... about. üòé
Guess whooo got into Hogwarts!
‚ÄúYou have been chosen to start a new school for witchcraft and wizardry...‚Äù
Lemme get this straight. You opened your window and set the thing outside with a letter, just to film how you open the window again? Aight
You best tip that boi a mouse.
Why didn‚Äôt they tip the owl for his hard work?
Yer a wizard amber.
This is old, VERY OLD video...this owl named YOLL' she lived in Russia
Can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt tip him for working in these trying times
r/oddlyterrifying
Watch out for those stairs
God, I wish. Hogwarts, take me away!
That is most definitely a rejection letter.
IM A WIZARD HARRY!



Harry: A what?
What a hoot
Where his tip, ya stinge
Yup no way to win a staring contest
What? No tip?
Owl: im watching you...git
I love this so much. Made my day.  

r/Superbowl would love this too.
Owl is like where is my worm
Give that man a nice plump rat for his troubles! PETER GET IN HERE!!!
P.S. 
The owl bites.
No tip? Hedwig would‚Äôve bit!
Is this like a random owl or is it a pet or an owl you befriended?
His faceü§£ü§£ü§£was like "why are we doing this again"
You didn‚Äôt give him a treat. What‚Äôs wrong with you?!
Your job application to Hooters has been accepted!
This Owl is Yoll!!!
Why would it need stamps if it came by owl mail?
The stare "Don't you dare close the door on me."
No this is a different letter. She trained her owl to grab the mail. Just a bird running on cat software I guess
Invite him in, be polite!
This Owl is kept in captivity.
Please uovote and tag mods to inform that.

https://youtu.be/Gxm7MHSr3TA
Crazy how the owl remains eye contact.
You didn't pet him or give him a treat to show appreciation?
Owls are terrifying
Uhu! It‚Äôs Yoll!
Awww this is so cute
The music was playing in my head the moment I saw him!
His eyebrows make him look very distinguished
Yoll ü§©
Nah, more likely sent by the weasleys with that number of stamps on the envelope
"No tip?!"
You‚Äôre a Harry wizard!
he wants paying you knut
Is that Yoll?
No tip?  Terrible customer.
that owl looks so intimidating
You didn‚Äôt have to go through the whole Magic to Muggle Mail hassle?

Cool
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being audited by the IRS Harry.‚Äù
I have so many questions üòÇ
r/petthedamnowl
I was immediately offended that the owl wasn't given a treat in exchange
You got it? You sure? Ok. 

Hey! Yo where‚Äôs my tip?
This gets re-shared a lot 

...and I'm always here for it. Take my upvote.
It‚Äôs time !!!!!!!
Pay him
Wow, I didn‚Äôt realise Hogwarts‚Äô letters would be delivered so passive aggressively!
So that's it? No invitation to come in? Not even a fucking cup of water? Damn it's just hard to be a decent hardworking owl nowadays
So like...no tip? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.... us owls are on minimum wage fyi üôÑ
https://thumbs.gfycat.com/OffensivePeskyCivet-size_restricted.gif
this is so cute, is it real?

That‚Äôs Yoll. The very reason I want an owl now..
Naww...thet's not creepy. Not in the least. (Slolwy reaches for the gun safe combo)
#PAY HIM
Ooh and it‚Äôs a thick envelope!
Hey, it's Yoll!
You forgot the owl treat offering!
Well give him a lettuce or something! I don‚Äôt know! Poor owl delivery guy!
I don‚Äôt think he wants you to go.
Where‚Äôs my money
That owl looks so confused
AND YOU DIDNT GIVE HIM A TREAT?! 
r/feedthedamnowl
Hang on... wasnt this flying around  the Internet years ago???? Pah..
Too good
Owls are so cute
I love how this owl looks like living incarnation of "Are we done?"
Give him a Knut!
He goes from wide eye and happy to help to why aren‚Äôt you feeding me for this bitch really quick lmfao
No snack for a tip? No Knut? I feel like all your future letters will either be chewed up, soaking wet, covered in poop or partially charred.
It's You'll the Eurasian eagle owl, the owner is Russian has a YouTube channel
Your a wizard OP
omg the eyes give it food or let it in ... but DO SOMETHING
‚ÄúThis bitch‚Äù
Give this owl a knut!
How was your weekend? "Not bad, I'm seeing a bird. She's not much to look at but big hooter and holds my package".
Yoll!
Look everyone! Weasley‚Äôs got himself a Howler!
A massive owl (I think they‚Äôre barn owls...) and its partner live in a tree in my back yard. I don‚Äôt know why but I consider that a point of pride and tell everyone that we have ‚Äúpet owls‚Äù and if you sit on the deck in the back yard at night long enough you can hear them making their owl noises. The big one has to be like 2.5-3 feet tall. It‚Äôs a big ass bird.  We also have falcons that like to come chill sometimes. And the occasional bald eagle sighting, cause as Donald Glover said, this is America.
Lucky!! I‚Äôm still waiting for mine, lol
It's the irs
Give him 5 knuts
Which house did the sorting hat send you to?
How are you gonna not tip for his services? Hes got mouths to feed, this isn't a game.
‚ÄúYer a Wizzerd Arry....‚Äù
Owls are such beautiful creatures
You're supposed to tip a few knuts
You're supposed to tip a few knuts
You‚Äôre supposed to give them a treat! Damn muggleborns
Last time, he needed a dead rat head and nose boop before he'd release the parcel...
What-a goodo boy!!
You didnt tip. Dude. Always tip.
The owl's like, gimme a treat or something.
You didnt tip. Dude. Always tip.
That stare though.
Got a new mailman today. He's creepy AF! He won't quit staring at me!
It‚Äôs the Justin Gaethje of owls
Did he have any more ?
A**hole didn't even pay him for his service! Lol
Let him in, he seems very polite.

No receive, only send.

Owls are so freaking cool
GIVE! OWL! TREAT!!
That is one derpy looking owl. He looks like a Frank.
How dare u shut the window without trying to give him some pets bruh
YOOOOOO FUCKING COOL
It's a rejection letter.
I‚Äôve been on reddit 10 minutes and this place is really magical like how do you even get an owl to deliver your dark web acid
Where‚Äôs the food!
Not even a pat on the head? ü•∫
"You're a wizard... Motherfucker."
-The Owl
Owl: Tips are appreciated
Person: But are the required
Owl: The are appreciated
Person: *Closes window*
I want one
Beautiful creature. What‚Äôs the story behind this owl delivering the mail?
After all these years...
I think the owl needs some serious explanation on how u got a letter from Hogwarts!!?
SMH I always tip for delivery
That‚Äôs terrifying
Owl: The fucker just stole my letter and didn't give me nuffin back! Can you belive that?
You couldn‚Äôt at least give him something for his trouble.
Who is the letter from? Who! No seriously who is it from? Who who!!!! Not sorry
If I had a dollar for every time I‚Äôve seen this owl deliver a letter from Hogwarts, I could finally afford tuition to go to Hogwarts
Ive been waiting for this moment for my entire life.
I hope I put on enough stamps
Poot little fella..
Some next level eye contact.
That's Yoll the owl
Better give him that 5 star review
Gotta tag r/harrypotter (hopefully i tagged correctly)
I was waiting for then to open it and it be a rejection letter based on that owl's face.
*wink*
Based on my expert parental audiology analysis and the owl‚Äôs anti-sharing behavior, I have determined this owl is in its Terrible Twos
Pay him!
He wants paying for delivering the paper. Look in the pockets!
This is every child's dream... and adult's too probably.
r/petthedamnowl
This has really made me smile despite lockdown blues,
The transaction clearly wasn‚Äôt complete on the chickens end.
Bruh....let him in!...it's hot outside
Didn‚Äôt even tip the Owl. No wonder he looks disappointed.
What the flak bro least invite owl inside ask for water shoe some manners.
The title says Hogwarts letter but his eyes say court summoning
No tip for the post-owl? Hoo do you think you are?!
I am so freaking jealous right now!
U
*closes window on owl*
Owl: "what no tip???"
"hey, where's my tip"
u/chowchowbeagle
I want this not to be fake
You didn't even pay him, you monster.
Give the owl a gift
Ha! Amazing!
That was terrible. You didn't even offer tea!
meanie you stole it from him
This is beautiful!
What house are you gonna be sorted into?
Bass boosted harry Potter theme? No?
Did you really close the window on this little guy? Damn, harshhhh
Still waiting for mine
WHAT?!?! NO TIP!?!?
Is this a real thing now? ‚ÄòCause I need to know.
He'll start pecking if he doesn't get paid
This seems like an incredibly intricate stunt to pull off for a joke:

1) Get pet owl and letter

2) Place owl outside

3) Get owl to eat letter

4) Close window

5) Start video

6) Open window

7) Take letter

8) Close window

9) End video

10) Open window

11) Take Owl

12) Close Window

The sheer complexity of this makes me think therefore that a far more simple solution is the actual one. That owl is actually from either Hogwarts, or the post office. The two most magical places on earth.
Well that was a hoot! Congrats on your acceptance... which house did you get sorted into?
Why is this so friggin Funny...ü¶âü§£
r/petthedamnowl ?
That owl be like ‚Äúyo, where‚Äôs my delivery tip?‚Äù tho.
You‚Äôve got mail.
Did you pay him his five sickles?
You never paid him!
At least pat him on the head.
Does anybody know what species of owl that is?
Give him a knut!

Feed the owl on delivery.
Thank you, owl slave.
Stop posting this.
You hurt all his feels!
"Send your cutest delivery boy."
Must of took a while cause your supposed to get it when your 11 unless...
Really?! Just gonna close the window on it like that without giving it a treat? Rude.
The tune automatically played in my head
TAKE ME WITH YOU
Oh, so this the Russian lady with the hot owl that lives in her house?! I love watching her videos even though I know zero Russian.
You must give him something!!
Yoll! My favourite owl! I love her and the YouTube channel and the other animals featured on it. Murloc, Iva, Gnus, Yuinya, Yt, Chuchundry, Blinets and most recently, Trun and Vshtyr the owlets. They‚Äôre honestly my main source of happiness rn ‚ù§Ô∏è
Look how calm she is as well
All this needs is the Harry Potter theme playing and it would be perfect
Wow they didn‚Äôt even tip the owl!
"Oh, no. It's fine. I didn't want to come in or anything."
Ok, this owl looks so cute. Just ‚ÄúNo, this is mine... ok you can have it. Imma keep staring at you though‚Äù
I know that's just how owls be, but those eyes and facial expression, they creepy.  Even the nicest owls, I swear they're the demons that'll be coming to pick up my soul in the middle of the night.

Unfortunately thats anonymous mail and needs to be returned to sender lol
This is Yoll! His owner puts out videos of him every few days, mostly of him just doing owl things.
Let him in
he wasn‚Äôt sure if he wanted to give it to you lol
This didn‚Äôt even register as a unique sight to me at first. Harry Potter is deep in my head.
This is the "I saw exactly what you did five minutes ago"look.
>And finally, to the left.
Waiting for a tip.
He was still holding onto it because you didn‚Äôt sign it off. How rude of you!

The owl was such a gentleman to a brute like you :(
Let him in
Should have at least speared a grape. Not cool bruh.
Why has no one dubbed hedwigs theme over this?
You are a wizard Harry
You better give him his treat
Definitely should have given the owl a treat. Maybe next time he brings cash.

I love how the owl tries to hang onto it like a dog playing fetch. What a good boy!
His demeanor changed greatly when he saw he wasn‚Äôt getting a tip
REPOST THIS GUY STOLE IT.. at least i hope so so i dont look like a jerk. I saw it on a Daily Dose Of Internet vidro a long time ago
Damn, waiting for the cameraman to give a treat but he just closes the window ):
Why would the letter have stamps on it?
It's an invitation to a reunion at Carl Poofy Pants Fairy High School.

Aren't you supposed to keep the owl?
Idk why but seeing you close the window on him made me laugh

Why did you not pet him for his troubles
That owl is ridiculously cute.

Why'd you not pet the owl

Well that was an awesome and amazing thing to happen, this has to be one of the best posts I've seen on the internet to date.

And I've seen a guy talk about a famous idiot with way too much good luck.
He is so floofy!!!

It's Yoll the Eagle Owl!
Holy cow. I did _not know_ that owls frowning was voluntary. I knew that they can mess around with their feathers to look scary, but it's not the same thing as a facial expression. 

You know all those videos and photos where you are looking at an owl looking at you with a scowl on his face like he ate something sour? Like, why are you all up in my business, you just made me miss my meal? He is *pulling that face* saying exactly what it looks like he's saying.

Watch this owl go from, "Oh, hey! Hey there!" to
