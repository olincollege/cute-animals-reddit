I'd pay for that hug rn. 
Do you have to be more careful when you first pet a blind dog, Like no to startle it? 
id like to formally request at least another 4 hours of you petting your dog please and thank you
I just lost one of my greys last week and this brought a shit load of joy to my heart. 
The way he lifts his leg is beyond adorable.
Thank you so much to everyone giving coins! Did not expect this to get so popular. 
I have other videos of him doing zoomies at the park and crashing into me, and also staring at a wall like it’s a window which I might also post. 

Edit: [as requested ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zoomies/comments/asmh6b/blind_longboy_destroys_everything_in_his_path/?st=JSD0J22P&sh=eb966ac5) 

What a sweet heart. Would never stop loving her. 
i love you, friend

so  very much

please Never end

your loving touch!

my world is dark

but when you're near

you light a spark -

i have no fear

you are my light 

n i have found

your love shines bright

when you're around












He's a sightless sighthound. H\*cking special. 15/10 would take on long walks and tell about all the squirrels. 
This is love at its purest.

Also, love the shirt.
Aw, what a sweetie.  I think if I ever decided to get a specific breed of dog, a greyhound would be in order, I have yet to hear anything bad about these guys.
I'm always glad to see that there are people who are willing and able to care for special needs pets.
Hold me close tiny prancer.
I love the hug he gives you! Warms my heart!
I honestly can't upvote this enough. 
I have that shirt!
It's naturally difficult with blind pets but it must be even more difficult with a greyhound (ofc considering yours has that neverending energy like many of them do). How do you exercise him?
((( Where's the line to get a hug from him? )))
What a precious boy!!! My sighty loves hugs too and for a sighthound she misses alot lol, I call her T rex because when you stay still she cant see you lol
How actively do the greyhound rescue organization work to lobby for the outlaw of this 'sport'.  Seems like the best way to rescue these dogs would be to eliminate the source of their abuse.
Best dogs ever. I miss mine dearly  http://imgur.com/2PgzcwJ
I swear greyhounds are just female deer. 
Greyhounds are so sweet ! Makes me wish I was at home petting my greyhound instead of working.
Nice we have the same toddler gate
My greyhound, Chief, is his twin! This makes me v happy
Oh, my vizsla hugs me just like that!
Why am I crying in the club rn 😭
Your greyhound is beautiful. ♥️
I know this doesn’t relate to your greyhound, but I clicked on your profile and read your 4 year-old post in r/anxiety on reaching out to others. It really moved me- thanks for your kindness and soul. Hope your doing well. 
I also have a sightless ‘sighthound’ and he loves cuddles too. Give your boy one from us please! 
Thanks for still loving him. Some people would just give him up 
Why do people keep saying dogs dont like hugs??
This pup has better fashion sense than I do, and I'm not blind. 
He is so precious! I'm glad he has a good person to care for him. 
Beautiful doggy!
God I want to hug it so bad
What an absolutely beautiful dog! 
I fucking love this   
Always found the pajama onesies the most adorable accessory of greyhounds.
Having had a family scottish terrier who was blind since birth I can say they just know where you are based on sound and smell. It gets heightened like mad. They have a constructed neural map of what you are and what you’re doing based on the senses they register. 

This is such a good boi!!
The smile on his face warms my cold, dead heart.
Oh man, I had a really crappy day and this warmed my grinchy heart right up. So precious.
I LOVE greyhounds. THIS melts my heart. Good, sweet doggo. 
This is stinking cute, I've watched it sixteen times. Your dog is besthound
Blind dogs may not see the physical world, but they still have the ability to "look" into our soul. Anyone who has/had a blind dog knows what I mean.
Our neighbors adopted a retired racing greyhound. It was the sweetest dog!  I had no idea. 
Thanks for posting. We lost one of our greys to osteo last October. He used to jump up and put both front paws on my shoulders and wait for me to rub his back.

Every single day when I got home, he'd meet me, ready for his hug. 

Miss him every single day. 

Thanks again for the post... and the good feels. 

Give your pup some scritches for me.
You Are THE bomb! Jus sayin.  and so is your pupper!!! Thanks for posting.  Made  me smile 😃 
So dumb they say dogs don't like being hugged or kissed. Fake news! All my dogs ever have loved their hugs and kisses. Your dog is so sweet
 ❤ him.

Fun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit. Enjoy
So cute~

/r/longboyes would appreciate this a lot
This dog obviously isn’t a greyhound. Greyhounds are grey, and this dog is brown. This...is a brownhound.
Everyone needs hugs 
I love greyhounds so much!
They are my favorite breed.

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! I miss puppy hugs!
My heart cannot take how much love is in this picture!
What a good boy!
Does he look out the window with a fan blowing in his face to reinact car?
Have to ask, How old??
I love greyhounds. My favourite type of dog.
He's a sweetie!  I have a blind dog too!
The message is clear: I love you too and don't stop petting me
/r/greyhounds would definitely love this!
Adorable dog and sweet shirt! LOZ 💛
Oh wow that's sweet. Also, those jammies. 
Greyhounds are just a lovely breed of pooches! 😃
Good for u also love the shirt 
Beautiful hound! I had two ex racers myself. Currently have a greyhound mix. Such gentle and quiet beasts!
Aww, man. Give that good boy a hug from me. 
The way (s)he licks her lips right when you start.

"Awwwwww YEAH thems some scritches coming yes I will hug in reciprocation I know we practiced this."
I can watch this all day
He may be blind in the eyes not blind to love and kindness. 
That dog showed more affection in that gif than my cat has in his whole stupid life. Why won’t you cuddle you monster?
"Yes, I DO love you hooman, see the leg-grab is proof, am not just standing here tolerating you."
My dog does that leg grab thing, but only when I'm going down the stairs.

Is it weird I want to hug your dog?
I have that same shirt!!!!!!! Also, nice dog.
Do greyhounds get cold easily? I see a lot of them wearing hoodies like this 
Nice triforce T-shirt from target! And what lovely doggo.
santas little helper 
You know you are a great guy when a blind dog knows who you are and huges you
I want to hug him! Give him all the love for me! 💕
Touch is the absolute best thing for a blind dog. We used to have a blind, deaf and partially paralyzed BMD that came into my old place of work and he just craved it like you wouldn’t believe. As soon as he felt you sit down on his bed his head would pop up and his tail would start going. With all those issues that poor fella was still was still such a happy dude.  I feel like most people would be miserable and dwell. Such wonderful creatures. 

That is really adorable how he hugs you!
Omg this makes me so happy. Lost my boy 6 years ago to osteosarcoma. Greyhounds are so sweet.
Found the zelda player
Wtf, why'd you make him blind?

JK, enjoy your time.  That's something I'm proud of after the cat died.  I was really good to her for the last few years.  She really opened up and became social.
You don’t have to have eyesight to feel the pure cuteness emanating from this video
My doggo hugs like that too ♡♡♡
I love a dog hug!! I love when they rest their heads on my shoulder or lean on me. I’m going to hug my dog now 
Greyhounds are the best
The way the doggo pulls you closer... that’s a whole lotta love. 
This is wholesome. No, not just wholesome, wholeMANY. I love this.
So beautiful and pure.    
Aww. What a sweetie 
💕🥰 
I love them too.

Sighthounds FTW!
Those are nice jammies!
Greyhounds really are the best. 
Long boi
Greyhounds are so beautiful.
I love his jammies. 
do very touching.  love him/ her forever please❤️❤️
What an absolute sweetheart! Love the jammies 
I've had many breeds of dogs including a retired racing greyhound. Greyhounds are pure love. He's beautiful. 
Aww bless his little soul 
That’s a good boy.
Well this is the best thing I've seen today.
That lovely son of a bitch
Is that a little doggie outfit? It looks like it even has a belt
This is a HUG.
 All other videos are just dogs humping their owners
is eye surgery to give him sight available?
Heckin sweetie
We don’t deserve dogs.
I'd like to think that blind doggos would be just as happy as any other doggo, long as they still have their human, and food :) 
Awww 😍
Honest question, this is the 5th greyhound that I see on a post that is blind, are they more prone to be blind?
What a sweet doggo
His paw around the leg is like saying "gimme some luv hooman"
💕💕💕💕💕💕
Aw bless his heart
Awww! Huggys!
I need a snuggie for all my pets
Aw. Maris learned one handed afffection
Awwww
Greyhounds are the best. 
aw :(
💕💕💕💕💕🐶
GOOD BOI
aww good boy
This warms my heart, cute baby!
I’ve seen more blind greyhounds, in both real life and on reddit, than almost any other dog breed. Is there something about those breed that makes them more susceptible for something like this?
Oh my god that hug. I aww'd outloud. My heart, oh my heart. That precious puppy.
Great dog!
I literally said “awww” out loud once I saw the pooch wrap his leg around the owner’s leg. Damn heart warming.
Good dog, good owner.
/r/specialaww would love him as well. 🙂
Wholesome as fuck
Cermit: Absolute unit style
Of course he does!  He's so adorable!

&#x200B;
Awh ❤️

Santos L Halper
Nile’s dog :)
My dog does that to me and it melts my heart.

Who wouldn’t love a hug?
Damn greyhounds are tall af
I love him.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Aww shit dawg, this is too much.  💗
A millions up votes!
Very sweet. 
How cute! What’s his name?
Why is it that grey hounds look fake when they hold still? (This guy is still cute though)
Omg cuteness overload. You're such a good person for adopting that cutie. He clearly loves you so much.
Awwww! Sweet pupper!
For the most part, who doesn't love hugs?
good pupper !
Don’t cry, don’t cry... shit is awesome bro, dap. Naw that’s just allergies. I’m allergic to love, I mean dogs... shut up, I have to go because of the dust in my eyes, I mean allergies. 
Such a Beauty .
I have a part whippet and she loves hugs. 
Everybody loves hugs ♥
L O N G B O I

He’s perfect
What a pet 
I love him
Big cermet
It's nice to know blind animals get more action than me
This is the cutest thing!!!!
This is love 
Poor dog be blind. No good. Bad medicine. 
How about you show some love and actually get down and give an actual hug. 
It should be illegal to stop hugging this sweet boy!
I’ve been with a blind dog this week and it is without a doubt the most heartbreaking thing, seeing him bump into things and the most heartwarming thing having him snuggle 
Is this the same dog that tried to fit in and play with the other dogs???

Such a cute dog
Do the Greyhound breeds all have a thing for hugging like this? I have an Italian Greyhound aka Cermet who gives the best little hugs.
Does no one else notice the doggo snuggie?!
This beautiful pup deserves all the hugs. :)
There is a blind dog at the daycare/kennel I work at, when I come in he has no idea what is going on and what the commotion is all about, but as soon as he smells me he starts jumping all over me and is so heart warming :) 
Plis protec this good boy forever.
Oh my heart...
Awww! Does he have cataracts? I'm sorry to hear about the whole blind thing, he looks like he's in good hands! :)
Dude I have that same shirt
That's happiness.
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all day! 😄😄😄
Dogs are the best people
Love the sweater! My current foster greyhound is a little zebra this winter
ugh my heart!! This is the cutest thing ive ever seen
He doesn't seem blind. 
I will need to see more of your dog, thx.
Please tell me his name is Link, like your shirt 😍♥️💕 I'm jk, but this is too cute!
For some reason I read the title as grey blindhound and spent a minute wondering why it wasn't grey and what a blindhound was
Just like i tell the kindergarten kids i work with, hugs are always free man and ur never to old for em. 
He also has a wonderful outfit!

Hug him for me? 💖 
Hey i got the same shirt 😂
I’m not crying, you’re crying. 
What a sweetie! 
Why do you have a deer in your house?
I love that initial lick of excitement as he goes into "ahh yessss" mode.
What kind of training do you have to be his seeing eye human?
What a sweetheart!
That Giraffe is wearing clothes
Im melting right here. Sweet boye
Awwwwwwwwwww
Oh man, he looks like our hound.

He passed last year after his rear half stopped working.
You are a service human
What a cuddly little boi
So sweet! 💗
Beautiful 
Thought you said "blond boyfriend".
Was hugging my dog who turned one two days ago while watching this, audible aww. Needed this. 
I need sound 
My doxy is blind and deaf, but he still knows what food, and love is haha
Adorable 💜🐾
So, how did he go blind?
omg I have had greys for 10 yrs and my heart...
I misread hugs as lungs, and confusedly agreed 
They are truly wonderful animals.
I used to have a greyhound, but it was taken away :(
Wholesome 
Wow I LOVE HIM
My heart! This is so precious and loving. 
Aw my dog does that too. 
This is so sweet. 
So pure 
 So sweet! 
This greyhound has more style than me. 
Sooo cute my sisters dog is blind 2. ; )
Aww! So cute!
Wholesome <3
Awwww, that’s great.
This melts my heart
Love the cozy jammies
Love this
So cute!
AS HE SHOULD!
Oh god, my heart
[deleted]
Wait, that hound isn’t grey! 🤔
I mean.... Why wouldn't he?
He just likes Zelda
Why wouldn't he?
Aww, that’s so sweet!
That leg grab at the end gets to me. I feel so conflicted when I see these animals. It is beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time.
My dogs does the exact same THING, except he wants to hump my leg
Oh god, I can't handle it when they hug back 
I really want to adopt a greyhound here in Florida since greyhound racing was recently banned. How demanding are they as dogs? I’ve heard they need to be walk quite often
I think my internal organs just collapsed by how cute that is
Goodest of boys
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen 😭 
I love how dogs just do a lick whenever...just whenever...like when you start petting or just, y'know, at random times. the cuteness makes me chuckle out loud
Awe that’s so precious! ❤️🐶🐾
Adorbs!
all the hugs 😊
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
He’s lovely
the first thing on r/aww that actually made me say “Aww” out loud
Why do dogs go blind?
I’ll get in the longest line every just to hug him.
My heart has officially melted.
How precious! ✨✨✨❤️❤️❤️❤️
So cute!
Amazing 
This made me audibly cry in my Uber.... good job.
Sweet pup!
Best time on 500m?
I’m not crying you are
the moment when he touch the dog is pure cuteness
OMG that’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen
Awe such a cute boy. Our almost 10 year old grey was diagnosed with cataracts this past winter. We are preparing for the blindness to set in. 
Seems like I’ve seen multiple blind greyhounds on Reddit. Is it genetic or just coincidence?
Best hearts on earth
My two greys say hello! 

Wonderful dogs.
This hound isn’t gray!
Very cute, but just asking why is it that so many greyhounds are blind?
I want to hug that pup! Adorable. 
Oh wow my heart. This is so sweet. 
Love the bathrobe.  He looks so dapper.
Bless you for loving him.
The leg part is amazing.  
Nice Legend of Zelda shirt.
I sort of want to hug your dog now.
Men have died for less
He's a Good Boi!! 
This makes me want a greyhound soooo much more. Eventually I’ll have a job with hours that are better for owning a dog. 
I love him
Aw so precious! I would hug any day
50mph blind rocket, cannot see this ever ending badly :D 
okay, your dog wears a zozosuit.
Me hugging my tall friends 
Nice
Very sweet ❤️
Grey's are the best. Sadly my grey Laddie passed away from bone cancer at age 10 about 4 years ago. 
The world greatest huggers! I really like your dog and I'm missing mine extra now....They look alike, a lot!
Dags, do ya like dags? 


Sweet 🧥 jacket 
He is a great friend to you... All the best to you both... Just asking, What happened to his eyes... Did you went to a doctor with him... Of course, you would have. But what did he tell you?
15/10 goodboy 
Love his dressing gown.
Aw I love his little sweater! Nice and cozy.

Thank God he can't see that shirt you hve him in. 
[deleted]
Your greyhound is not Blind. I'm watching a dog that has fully functioning eyes.
For fucks sake, put the poor thing down already.
Lol
How does being blind make him any different huh? My BlInD DoG!!11!! hE hAs AIdS PleAase UpVoTe!!!
