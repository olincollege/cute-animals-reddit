Congrats, he’s selected you for the next round!  See you next week on ABC.
Yeah, mine started like this, bringing home leaves like some kind of vegan warrior. It ended with vole guts smeared up the walls.
Worked at a research station developing shrimp mariculture and they had a HUGE grey tom that went by the name of Graphite (I know, science).  He OWNED the place, and the other cats and dogs stayed the hell out of his way.  He'd bring employees or visitors he liked gifts as well, oftentimes ground squirrel or lizard.  I got two squirrels in one day, I guess I was on his well-liked list.
Do not fall for this cat's wily charms (as charismatic and gentlemanly as he may be) he only wants more treats
I got a dead rat once from my dog.  Near my bed when I woke up in the morning. It was still sort of soft and eatable, so a true gift.  I reacted as expected, and poor Sally Mae looked so dejected.  My dad was horrified when I told him (what I had done).  He said, "But you gave her a cookie, didn't you!"
Sometimes our cat will bring us dead birds.  We don't really encourage this but it's the thought that counts.
So! The cat locks up the dog in the bathroom and tries to distract you with a flower...he’s sneakier than I thought!
That is one handsome cat
And they say chivalry is dead. This cat says nope!
My mom and dad, 4 years after looking their beloved cat, finally decided it was time to adopt another cat. They instead found a sister and brother. The brother, Cosmo, took to getting flowers and dropping them at my moms feet. The sister, Coco, never did this. Cosmo unfortunately was hit by a car and died when he was a about a year old. The day after he died, coco brought my mom a flower. Cats know.
Dude has more game than 90% of the guys I know. Respect
Why were you filming tho, jw
He must be a true gentleman walking around on an inflatable mattress!!
Now you must eat the flower
And I wake up to the cat pissing in my bed
Many flowers are poisonous to cats. Looks like a rose which is okay. Be sure to look them up before you let your cat around them. Stargazer lilies almost killed my cat and cost >$1000.
One might ask where did he find that ⚰️ carnation from ?  🧐
'He wow is me every day'

*Nice*
Mine just brings me balled up receipts that he finds in the trash.
Wait until he brings in a bat in the middle of the night. We’ll see how much you’ll be wowed lol

Can i have ur cat
Do cats do things like this for each other?

Yesterday reddit had a cat bringing bottle caps to a human
That is so sweet. My cat will most probably bring me a dead bug,dead mouse or something gross but dead. He thinks he is bear grylls or something even though he is a pedigree persian.
M’ew lady

Now feed me
[deleted]
I need me some insulin for this.
Ugh I hate when people brag about what their partners do for them🙄
He is so precious and handsome!
Aww that's a Lisianthus it symbolizes a lifelong bond and appreciation
“Here’s a flower, now you feed me twice hoooman!”
Russian Blue?
Mine brought a dead pigeon once
*wows
the power of plastic
Meanwhile our cat recently brought home a live snake and dropped it beside our bed.
I love all the posts about teaching dogs to fetch a beer from the fridge. They always degrade into "when the beer is gone the dog just starts bringing random stuff from the fridge for treats" or "I have the keys to the castle, I will eat $200 worth of groceries in the eight seconds you aren't looking".

Cats at least think they are doing you a favor.
And you just happened to be recording?
Lol goddamn people, "if you didn't film it, it didn't happen!" *Films it* "you filmed it so it must be fake"....
The way this video was filmed makes me think that this cat is like mine (plays fetch) and OP just threw a flower across the room and filmed the retrieval.
That little paw nudge to make sure you know it’s for you is beautiful.
He’s so cute
my cat brought me a dead bird...
A soul has unfinished business....
My cat used to bring me presents. It was mostly unpaid bills.
My old cat used to bring me live snakes.
And, luckily this is lisianthus, one of my favorite flowers, and relatively safe for cats! Good boi!
Lawd they romantic
Wonder how long it’ll take me to train my cat to do that 🥰
What a distinguished gentleman
I think the cat has the luck to marry this romantic cat
Lisianthus. What a connoisseur
That’s love right there
He does this because he thinks you're a terrible hunter, so he needs to share his kills with you. Try to act impressed, that flower didn't go down without a fight.
Just wait until you see what he did with the rest of the bouquet.
“Here mom, since you can’t get any yourself” lol
This cat is clearly a Human trapped in a cats body
🥰 🤗 what a beautiful boy! 😍
Wasn't there a GoPro video of a cat who brought home the fallen dentures of a woman?  I'm not sure if anything can top that.
Aww he's so adorable
Precious
Handsome boi
This looks just like my cat. He's half Russian blue and also a hopeless romantic.
That’s so sweet. Mine brings gloves from all around the neighborhood and an occasional dish sponge.
He reminds me of a cat my ex and I had together.  His name was Wesley and I adored that little guy.
You have one of the good ones. Mine only brings me live rats that she lets go in the house to "play" with.
My cat brings me neighbours underpants for some reason. It's the thought that counts.
He’s lovely
mine likes to attack a piece of drywall for 20 minutes nonstop then take a nap, almost as cool as this !
Imagine getting gentleman-zoned
Was watching Midsommer Murders and they had a Russian Blue named Killmousky.
My cats used to bring dead carcasses of the mice they killed as an offering to me.  This is much more pleasant
I only ever got beheaded bunnies.
Does he make a howling sound while he brings the gift?  Mine does.
Grey cats are so darn pretty. The softness and greyness just go so well together.
Gray cats are so wonderful.  My sweet Merlin, also known as the best cat who ever lived, is gray and white.
What a sweetie!
Good to see chivalry is still a thing
His eyes are genuine, ring that fucker.

Kitty presents can be the best!! However when I was younger and stupider we had a cat door. Our 1 cat used to bring us in birds she caught. But not dead birds, she would carefully bring them in alive for us and let them go.
More like meows you every day bruh
Ah yes a cat of culture
My cat does this but the flower looks and smells like dead mice
But the real question is "do you have a broken vase and water all over the kitchen floor"? Lol
There is no apostrophe in “wows”.
Mr. steal-yo-girl is smooth.
Nice of him, and nice of you to not call him stalker afterwards 🙂
My cat just brings in live birds and let's them loose in our house. She even has this little smirk like she's fucking laughing at us.
wows\*
Omg so it's getting pretty serious between you two 🤭
This actually indicates his mild acknowledgement of you in his life. If a cat is signaling true affection he will bring you a disgusting dead bird.
r/whyweretheyfilming
Owner tossed the flower. The cat fetched it. Hence why there’s a video. Your cat did not go out and pick a flower for you.
I always considered myself a dog person.  That was until I got a cat.  The cat was 18 months old and was a wonderful pet.  He was with me for 13 years.

I am now a cat person.
Your tactics confuse and frighten me sir, but if you want a flower instead of a rat, I will oblige.
Wow... So Cute Cat with rose.
Mr. Steal Your Girl, showing everybody whos been lazy they need to step up their game.

Filmed ? Fake
Wow crazy you just happen to have your camera rolling as soon as he happen to stroll into the house for flower in his mouth. This totally isn’t fake or anything. You’re totally not fishing for Carmel online. No one ever does that.
Awe
"Coincidentally I was filming at that exact time although I had no idea because this was not staged at all"
What a gentleman
Look at those eyes! This cat is so....sentient and aware. It looks like a human trapped in a cat's bosy to me lol
And you just so happened to catch it on camera. Wonder how long it took to train the cat for treats.
And you just happened to be filming...
Playing fetch with a plastic flower, while recording, then edit.
Conveniently recording. Cat didn't got out to a garden a pick this specifically to please you. You're merely playing fetch with him
Throws fake flower, records cat bringing it back, posts online and pretends he brought it in for her.
Anddd that's the cutest thing I've seen all week.
how did you know to start recording? was it because you threw his gift away and knew he'd bring it back?
Why were you filming?
Have my award
Russian Blue’s are the best.
Just happened to be recording hey, how fortunate.
Lol, you just happened to be recording? Let's be honest, you threw the flower.
Not to be a party pooper, but I dont believe this is genuine
That is a toy that you threw and the cat brought back to throw again.
Instant love. He should be the next The Batchelor.
Missed the opportunity to say "Meows me everyday". We must learn from our mistakes.
I think you mean, “he meows you every day”
look

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
They are amazing in every way! Love kitties. 🥰
Awww! My cat tries to eat my flowers.  :(
Fuck off no, there is no way that Cat brought you such a perfect flower.d

I cannot even get a slug ppt o look gme in the eye without vomiting, how do you all have beautiful animals bring you gifts every day?b
I'm not jealous. Those are plastic. Plus he has a thorny dick and mine's way smoother. Also I don't have to hold things with my mouth because I have hands. I'm not worrying about anything for now. Feeling pretty good about where I am in all this. Plastic flower, pffft.
[deleted]
Amazing that you just happened to be filming at the very moment
Amazing how your cat can pull the flower when the tip is cut w scissors. How does your cat use scissors with out an opposable thumbs
I had a 2nd floor apartment with a balcony where I had a garden. When leaves would fall off my cat would bring them to me. He seemed very pleased to do this.
Not a mouse?

be honest, this is one of those days where its not a dead bird, mouse or squirrel?
What a lovely cat you have, what breed is he?
Just wait til he brings you the stripped skeleton of a gopher. Still pretty much intact except for the head.

This is usually a clue that the rat fucker knocked over a vase.
I think my cold black shriveled up heart would melt if a cat did that for me.
This was planted.
As long as it is not a poisonous to cats flower, that is so sweet.  ♡♡♡
I know it was you Fredo. You broke my heart
I like how he made sure it still looked pretty with his little paw
How very kind of him !
Wows you every day?? Or Meows you everyday!!
In other news, you also have a smashed vase and wet mess in another room.
That face is too cute
*Tips fedora* Mew’lady.
YOu might want to kiss that cat, might turn into a prince
Yeah mine just stepped into my bedroom with poop on her foot. Never thrown a cat out that fast. Room smelled like poop for over an hour.
Give this good sir a treat for the sake of everyone watching this
More like he mewows you every day
That’s what real love looks like
My boy just brings us fatherless sticks. They're fatherless because he plucked all the feathers out. 😸
Russian blues are the best. My first kitty ever when I was a kid was a blue. So smart yet so chill.
We had a cat that would do this, and it evolved into playing "fetch" - throw the flower and he'd bring it back...he'd do it for hours.
He "killed" it for you.  😊❤😻
Un Chat charmeur ça me rappelle "Le Chat Potté".
Nice
He thinks it’s a half-eaten bird carcass
Careful with that, some flowers are extremely toxic to cats like Lillies.
as beautiful of a gesture as it is, something tells me the cat wants food in return.
More like he meows you everyday. 


Bye.
That is the cat in the Ghibli ! In cat kingdom movie !
Careful it starts with flowers then turns into half eaten dead mice
Bet this handsome boy
My sister's cat likes to bring in live animals and release them. Lizards, snakes, mice, birds, the occasional cicada.

My cat is too dumb to even catch the animals sis' cat brought in.
Awe.  That’s way better than the dead sparrow I got yesterday.
Ours brings half eaten mice and bird chicks ... fantastic start of the day
my cat brought me the decorative  frog from a planter covered in potting soil. in my bed.
Oh my god he is so cute

Our cat brings all of his favorite toys into our bedroom one by one at night when we go to sleep. We wakeup covered in toys and it’s adorable. Sometimes he will bring his toy mouse (his favorite) onto the bed and quietly play while constantly checking to make sure we are asleep
Thanks for making the rest of us look back!

Your cat might be obsessed with you. Next it will be a decapitated rodent head!
Only thing my cat ever brings is mice =(  Which is good since shes an inside cat, but less cute. She gets good wet food n treats n stuff though when she does bring mice.
Cat~ I also pooped in the flower pot.

My kitty only brings me zip ties. Then expects me to return the favor by tossing them. If I don't, even if it's because I'm sleeping, he bites my fingers, as if to remind me of my job.

My cat looks exactly like that. Single most affectionate creature I've ever encountered. She 20 years old and barely hanging on but I think she's sticking around to take care of me.

I guess that he's your 💝,or you're his?
I rescued a kitten who looks exactly like this boy from my work a month ago, hes grown a bit now but hes extremely cuddly and affectionate. Took me almost a week to get him friendly as he was clearly abandoned when he arrived at work with a ginger kitten with him...My MIL is certain its a purebred breed but Im just happy to have a nice cat!
Plot twist: there's a cemetery a block away.
I miss my cat.
Mine bring me roaches when I'm sleeping... 2 alive 1 dead up until now. The dead one he put it in my hand, one of the live ones the female brought it under the bed sheets (and it walked all over me). The last one I'm pretty sure it was the male again and dumped it on my eye... Oh and the female brought a gecko once but luckily it was unharmed and I could rescue it.

I've had them for 7.5 years and they started doing this shit now T________T
Aw mine does the same except it’s the branches of my pine tree, which he knows he’s not supposed to touch “but it’s just so fun”. At least he can’t get into our spider plants anymore, we had to put them up cause they’re mildly hallucinogenic to cats and so he’d go to town on them if given the chance.
My kitten brought me a perfect leaf, a perfect feather and a perfect stick all in her mouth at once and dropped them at my feet. We still have them framed on the wall.
I love the way he taps it after laying it next to you, as if he’s reassuring you it’s for you! Then looks up for a second confirmation. You got a smarty there for sure! I’d say a keeper! 💕
It's Daisy the flower bringer.

I had a bag of lollipops in my basement office and my cat would go down there and grab a lollipop to give me almost every day no matter where I was in the house. He'd drop one on or near me... He's a good boy.
Looks just like my Lil bean
My cat brings me mouse heads. Just the heads. I’ll find the body a few days later usually. He likes to simulate the French Revolution I suppose. Remove the head, gift it to your human, hide the body.
Funny lol 🤣🤣
A very handsome cat.
WARNING! 🛑 That could be a mouse shaped rose! Or a rose shaped mouse! They're a crafty bunch, those cats. My sweetie, Ramon  used to snag the little bells off my Christmas tree and trot down the hall to my bedroom to deliver one to me..ding-ding-dinging all the way. Never stopped cracking me up! I left them out on the coffee table all year round...For his and my amusement! Your baby is gorgeous  and you deserve every ⚘
Haha that’s so cute!
He was feline romantic.
He meows you every day
Omg it’s too precious love him
My cat brought me a bird and a mouse once, then another time just the head of a bird and that’s when I had to sit him down and have the talk.
He wooing you

I have one that could be his twin sister except she has socks and faint tabby markings on her head and tail
Awwwww
My cat comes to me for pets, bites me, then runs off and pukes on the floor. Pretty much the same thing.
What a sweetheart
He is adorable!
awwwwwww🥺🥺🥺 I want a furry companion who does this
Awe this melted my heart
This is his apology for destroying the flowers in the other room haha
An awful lot of flowers are highly toxic to cats, did you check to make sure this one was one of the safe ones?

I know a lot of decorational flowers that you wouldn't think of as being toxic are harmful to pets, like Lilies and Daffodils.

Hope kitty didn't get into anything harmful but if I was you I'd be careful since he's being known to get into flowers.
r/dustkitties
Mine brought me a dead mole so pretty much the same. He’s caught 3 this week.
