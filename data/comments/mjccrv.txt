Congrats, he‚Äôs selected you for the next round!  See you next week on ABC.
Yeah, mine started like this, bringing home leaves like some kind of vegan warrior. It ended with vole guts smeared up the walls.
Worked at a research station developing shrimp mariculture and they had a HUGE grey tom that went by the name of Graphite (I know, science).  He OWNED the place, and the other cats and dogs stayed the hell out of his way.  He'd bring employees or visitors he liked gifts as well, oftentimes ground squirrel or lizard.  I got two squirrels in one day, I guess I was on his well-liked list.
Do not fall for this cat's wily charms (as charismatic and gentlemanly as he may be) he only wants more treats
I got a dead rat once from my dog.  Near my bed when I woke up in the morning. It was still sort of soft and eatable, so a true gift.  I reacted as expected, and poor Sally Mae looked so dejected.  My dad was horrified when I told him (what I had done).  He said, "But you gave her a cookie, didn't you!"
Sometimes our cat will bring us dead birds.  We don't really encourage this but it's the thought that counts.
So! The cat locks up the dog in the bathroom and tries to distract you with a flower...he‚Äôs sneakier than I thought!
That is one handsome cat
And they say chivalry is dead. This cat says nope!
My mom and dad, 4 years after looking their beloved cat, finally decided it was time to adopt another cat. They instead found a sister and brother. The brother, Cosmo, took to getting flowers and dropping them at my moms feet. The sister, Coco, never did this. Cosmo unfortunately was hit by a car and died when he was a about a year old. The day after he died, coco brought my mom a flower. Cats know.
Dude has more game than 90% of the guys I know. Respect
Why were you filming tho, jw
He must be a true gentleman walking around on an inflatable mattress!!
Now you must eat the flower
And I wake up to the cat pissing in my bed
Many flowers are poisonous to cats. Looks like a rose which is okay. Be sure to look them up before you let your cat around them. Stargazer lilies almost killed my cat and cost >$1000.
One might ask where did he find that ‚ö∞Ô∏è carnation from ?  üßê
'He wow is me every day'

Mine just brings me balled up receipts that he finds in the trash.

Do cats do things like this for each other?

Yesterday reddit had a cat bringing bottle caps to a human
That is so sweet. My cat will most probably bring me a dead bug,dead mouse or something gross but dead. He thinks he is bear grylls or something even though he is a pedigree persian.

Meanwhile our cat recently brought home a live snake and dropped it beside our bed.
I love all the posts about teaching dogs to fetch a beer from the fridge. They always degrade into "when the beer is gone the dog just starts bringing random stuff from the fridge for treats" or "I have the keys to the castle, I will eat $200 worth of groceries in the eight seconds you aren't looking".

Cats at least think they are doing you a favor.
And you just happened to be recording?
Lol goddamn people, "if you didn't film it, it didn't happen!" *Films it* "you filmed it so it must be fake"....
The way this video was filmed makes me think that this cat is like mine (plays fetch) and OP just threw a flower across the room and filmed the retrieval.
That little paw nudge to make sure you know it‚Äôs for you is beautiful.
He‚Äôs so cute
my cat brought me a dead bird...
A soul has unfinished business....
My cat used to bring me presents. It was mostly unpaid bills.
My old cat used to bring me live snakes.
And, luckily this is lisianthus, one of my favorite flowers, and relatively safe for cats! Good boi!
Lawd they romantic
Wonder how long it‚Äôll take me to train my cat to do that ü•∞
What a distinguished gentleman
I think the cat has the luck to marry this romantic cat
Lisianthus. What a connoisseur
That‚Äôs love right there
He does this because he thinks you're a terrible hunter, so he needs to share his kills with you. Try to act impressed, that flower didn't go down without a fight.
Just wait until you see what he did with the rest of the bouquet.
‚ÄúHere mom, since you can‚Äôt get any yourself‚Äù lol

This looks just like my cat. He's half Russian blue and also a hopeless romantic.
That‚Äôs so sweet. Mine brings gloves from all around the neighborhood and an occasional dish sponge.
He reminds me of a cat my ex and I had together.  His name was Wesley and I adored that little guy.
You have one of the good ones. Mine only brings me live rats that she lets go in the house to "play" with.
My cat brings me neighbours underpants for some reason. It's the thought that counts.
He‚Äôs lovely
mine likes to attack a piece of drywall for 20 minutes nonstop then take a nap, almost as cool as this !
Imagine getting gentleman-zoned
Was watching Midsommer Murders and they had a Russian Blue named Killmousky.
My cats used to bring dead carcasses of the mice they killed as an offering to me.  This is much more pleasant
I only ever got beheaded bunnies.
Does he make a howling sound while he brings the gift?  Mine does.
Grey cats are so darn pretty. The softness and greyness just go so well together.
Gray cats are so wonderful.  My sweet Merlin, also known as the best cat who ever lived, is gray and white.

Kitty presents can be the best!! However when I was younger and stupider we had a cat door. Our 1 cat used to bring us in birds she caught. But not dead birds, she would carefully bring them in alive for us and let them go.

This actually indicates his mild acknowledgement of you in his life. If a cat is signaling true affection he will bring you a disgusting dead bird.
r/whyweretheyfilming
Owner tossed the flower. The cat fetched it. Hence why there‚Äôs a video. Your cat did not go out and pick a flower for you.
I always considered myself a dog person.  That was until I got a cat.  The cat was 18 months old and was a wonderful pet.  He was with me for 13 years.

I am now a cat person.
Your tactics confuse and frighten me sir, but if you want a flower instead of a rat, I will oblige.
Wow... So Cute Cat with rose.

Look at those eyes! This cat is so....sentient and aware. It looks like a human trapped in a cat's bosy to me lol
And you just so happened to catch it on camera. Wonder how long it took to train the cat for treats.
And you just happened to be filming...
Playing fetch with a plastic flower, while recording, then edit.
Conveniently recording. Cat didn't got out to a garden a pick this specifically to please you. You're merely playing fetch with him
Throws fake flower, records cat bringing it back, posts online and pretends he brought it in for her.
Anddd that's the cutest thing I've seen all week.
how did you know to start recording? was it because you threw his gift away and knew he'd bring it back?
Why were you filming?
Have my award
Russian Blue‚Äôs are the best.
Just happened to be recording hey, how fortunate.
Lol, you just happened to be recording? Let's be honest, you threw the flower.
Not to be a party pooper, but I dont believe this is genuine
That is a toy that you threw and the cat brought back to throw again.
Instant love. He should be the next The Batchelor.

I'm not jealous. Those are plastic. Plus he has a thorny dick and mine's way smoother. Also I don't have to hold things with my mouth because I have hands. I'm not worrying about anything for now. Feeling pretty good about where I am in all this. Plastic flower, pffft.

Amazing that you just happened to be filming at the very moment
Amazing how your cat can pull the flower when the tip is cut w scissors. How does your cat use scissors with out an opposable thumbs

Plot twist: there's a cemetery a block away.
I miss my cat.
Mine bring me roaches when I'm sleeping... 2 alive 1 dead up until now. The dead one he put it in my hand, one of the live ones the female brought it under the bed sheets (and it walked all over me). The last one I'm pretty sure it was the male again and dumped it on my eye... Oh and the female brought a gecko once but luckily it was unharmed and I could rescue it.

I've had them for 7.5 years and they started doing this shit now T________T
Aw mine does the same except it‚Äôs the branches of my pine tree, which he knows he‚Äôs not supposed to touch ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs just so fun‚Äù. At least he can‚Äôt get into our spider plants anymore, we had to put them up cause they‚Äôre mildly hallucinogenic to cats and so he‚Äôd go to town on them if given the chance.
My kitten brought me a perfect leaf, a perfect feather and a perfect stick all in her mouth at once and dropped them at my feet. We still have them framed on the wall.
I love the way he taps it after laying it next to you, as if he‚Äôs reassuring you it‚Äôs for you! Then looks up for a second confirmation. You got a smarty there for sure! I‚Äôd say a keeper! üíï

An awful lot of flowers are highly toxic to cats, did you check to make sure this one was one of the safe ones?

I know a lot of decorational flowers that you wouldn't think of as being toxic are harmful to pets, like Lilies and Daffodils.

Hope kitty didn't get into anything harmful but if I was you I'd be careful since he's being known to get into flowers.
