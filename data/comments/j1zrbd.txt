I need this to become a montage of bigger and bigger hats as OP brushes the cat over time
I am doing this to my German Shepherd, except I will be able to make him a pair of pants,  hoodie and hat
The bugged eyes of the cat made me laugh at the beginning were it just stared at its owner and the comb.

I appreciate the style and creativity. 10/10
The volume of that music almost made me evacuate my bowels
Man, Covid is going to birth some wierd art movements isn't it.
"I used the cat to clothe the cat"
God help those who watched it with sound on.
Hey, what is that nifty shaving tool you’re using there?
Purrlock Holmes
imagine wearing your own discarded chest hairs as a hat
TIL: Cats have wool and not fur, as previously understood by biologists.
This is the content that gets me out of bed in the morning
First Hat: Okay this is kind of cute human 

Second Hat: I like this hat way more human

Third Hat: Human, this is becoming a bit much

Fourth Hat: whatever
Ok serious question—how do you make the hats?
"Oh God not again"
"I mean *meow*"
Such a beautiful cat! And awesome hats haha
I applaud the fashion sense of your relish looking cat!
He’s going to have hat hair now
The Cat In The Hat
But when I do this with a human they call me weird 😏
I feel like cats are always thinking.... “wtf”
what type of kitty is this 🥺👉👈
Whats the song?
Well that just sounds like hair with extra steps
Imagine wearing your skin-hat
This is a beautiful cat, what is the breed?
Just thinking about using your own hair to make hats. That's gross.
As a non cat owner I find it slightly disgusting the cat is wearing its own fur (hair?)
ah yes, skin hats
Happy to know I’m not the only one who does this...
I like the third hat best!
Purrrrrfect
Cannot express how much I love this and how jealous I am of the felting skills
So the cat is wearing a hat made out of its own fur? Now that's what I call bigbrain
How clever and creative of you, nice!
love it so cute cats have so much hair lol
Imagine if someone took you skin and made you wear it as a hat lmao

Superb Work!  I love the Baker Boy style :D
Such a gorgeous cat
Stylish boi
This is cute and all but isn’t this essentially just like shaving off ur body hair and wearing it on ur head lol
Is that a shaver? Or another type of fixed blade tool? If so any link. I want it.
I now feel jealous and like I wasted all of my dogs haircuts. She’s almost 15... should could have had two dozen hats. DAMMIT!
This is the best thing I've seen in my whole entire life!

This cat is amazing, I love his/her expressions of surprise when you pull out the shedding comb, that is the face of experience lmao
The cat's SO done with your shit

You are a genius. Oh and your cat is adorable too 😅
The Pickel-Haube at the end is the best, but they're all good hats

Omg I have a furminator for my cats too I've been making wool balls now I'm upping my game
That's a well preened cat.

When you showed up the razor and then the look was in your cat's eyes ...omg I can't stop laughing !!

I like how the cat winked at you my cat winks at me
I feel like this person would try and sell those hats on Etsy or something.

Missed opportunity for "cat in the hat"

How did you do this? I’m going to be brushing out two rabbits this week and would like to do this!
This is like making a shirt out of your own dead skin, weird but cool.
Imagine making a hat out of dead human skin
This reminds me of that cartoon of a farm, with a sheep with a lot of wool, and all the other animals are cold, so a crow leads the sheep through a bush of brambles, that shear the sheep, and then the crown makes clothes for all the animals out of the sheared wool.
Thanks for including not quite enough of the lyrics to figure out what's being said or who's saying it or what the song is supposed to be.
What is the song name?
I used the cats to make the hats
"wool"
What is this song? I know it’s Pink Elephants but I *have* to find this version.

This kitty has a kinda perpetual sadness look about it , only corrected by the wearing of these fur hats....js

Imagine going to your barber; they cut your hair, collect it and then pile it all on top of your head.
Have you you sent this to the furminator people? They would probably at least give you a free one!
Damn i would make mustaches for myself, never thought to make my cat a hat! Onward and Upward my friends!
An efficient guide to wearing yourself, if you’re human, try this:

Step 1- cut off all your skin
Step 2- realise you’re a dumbass
Step 3- maki it into a hat
Step 4- put the hat on the raw body you have only with remainders of head hair left
Step 5- wow. You made it here?! I’d expect you’d be dead by now.

Adorable!  My first dog as a kid was a Siberian Husky and one year my mom had a local crafter turn her shedded fur into yarn and make me a toboggan. I still wear it 25 years later. It is a cherished item for me which always makes me think of that beautiful pupper after she is long gone.
That music scared me so bad
