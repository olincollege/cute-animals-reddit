I now want a sitting pit.
Wow the camouflage is awesome.  Would totally trip over that bear and get eaten.
Bear is having some Deep Thoughts. Like heavy duty bear issues to contemplate.
Bears have no business being as friend-shaped as they are.
Awww I love her big bear butt! I just want to cuddle her and hope it doesn't hurt too much when she kills me for being so stupid.
I‚Äôm a little jealous, that looks like a wonderful way to spend the day.  In a sitting pit watching ducks.
Despite him being a wild animal, you just kind of want to sit next to him with your arm around him and watch the ducks too.
Must be a German bear
Such cute little ears but so deadly
If dangerous? Why fluffy? ü§®
Wow, thanks for all your upvotes, kind strangers!

Little backstory on the video: This was filmed in a place called the ‚Äûbear forest‚Äú in Northern Germany. It is a sanctuary where bears that have been held in bad conditions come after being rescued by an organization called Four Paws. 

Four Paws has sanctuaries for rescued animals in eleven countries worldwide. If you like what they are doing and want to support, this is [their website. ](https://www.four-paws.org/)
TIL bears dig sitting pits!
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time...
I've never seen a bear do this, thanks for sharing!

Question: Is that thin-looking wire fence all that separates you from the big fuzzy bear?
Big fat dog
Bears are the only animals other than people who have been observed countless times admiring a pretty view. Sunsets, a pretty meadow, ducks :), etc!!
Same mood, bear. Same mood.
Well this is just wonderful.
Do bears eat ducks? Lions like to lounge on the hills above when their dinner likes to graze, to keep an eye on them for when it‚Äôs time to go catch one.
Fun Fact: When laying down to rest, Alaskan brown bears dig ‚Äúbelly holes‚Äù to accommodate their food-filled bellies‚Äîthe bigger the belly, the bigger the hole!
Tony Soprano would be proud

If only we could all chill and watch ducks. I envy you, bear. <3
I always wonder why nature made Grizzlies and Black bears meat eaters. theyre so cute I want to cuddle them. Forbidden snuggles.
My dog dug a sitting pit once when we were out camping. It was similarly adorbs.
Ducks are friends not food..
Sometimes I wish my life was that easy.
This again proves that most mamals are sentient
I too, enjoy a view whilst taking a shit
A few years ago my dog got ahold of my weed and ate it all. She proceeded to dig a hole in the shade, lay in it for several hours, then come in and eat an entire bowl of food then nap the rest of the day.


This reminds me of that because shes a chow mix so one of her nicknames is bear dog.


She also ate an entire tub of Vaseline. We called the vet and they told us to tip a capsule of peroxide down her throat so she'd puke it up. We did that, but she never got sick and never had greasy poops either.


Also once she jumped out my mom's second story window. Mom was painting her windowsill and walked away to do something. Reba climbed up on the roof and jumped to freedom. My ex chased after her and cornered her on a porch.


Shes 14 now and going blind and deaf. She's got diabetes and sometimes falls over because her back legs dont work as well. I know shes nearing the end, but she can still support herself and eats like a chunky monkey. I love my Reba Roo.
just want to jump on its back hug it and then pass out
I could watch this bear, watch those ducks, all day!
‚ÄúI just think they‚Äôre neat‚Äù
That is some serious camouflage too, nice work Yogi üëè
god i identify with bears so much.
I did not read that as *sitting* pit at first.
This makes me sad somehow. I think animals in captivity make me sad :/

Was recently reading how bears have been observed with just sitting and taking in good views, sunsets, etc, for no purpose other than, simply admiring them, in theory. I‚Äômma say this only boosts that theory. And yeah, need me a sitting pit
I am pretty sure that bear is building a duck hunting pit blind.
Pretty scary how well that bear blends in with the dirt.

"Oh this looks like a nice spot for a picnic by the pond...."
Don't sit on the furry boulder!
Nice ambush spot. Blends in pretty well!
Bears are literally gigantic untaimed dogs
Only the bear necessity.
Bearcliner
Awwwww
That camouflage is amazing. Nature is so, so cool.
Wait till he realizes he can keep digging and escape under that fence.
This video needs to be longer, it's so relaxing and serene.
That‚Äôs awesome. Minus the captivity. 

Never mind. Read OP‚Äôs comment. It‚Äôs a sanctuary so good type of captivity
he's having a nice ASMR
Watching them fatten up for the annual Turducken feast with the family.
I like how the duck can tell that the bear is in "lazy mode" and is safe.
Mindfulness meditation.
I know plenty of bears have a difficult life trying to get enough food to not die but fuck when I look at my thumbs and think of my brain andy job I'm like "Wow I am proof that evolution is stupid sometimes"
That‚Äôs so cool
We built the internet to watch a video of a bear watching ducks.
Or a pouncing pit, just saying
Like a glove
Perfect camouflage
He blends in with the sand
That‚Äôs called camouflage üò¨
I think most bears are smart and peaceful. like pigs.  When they look at you, they don't want to eat you, or fight... they might want to be left alone... maybe to find some food... and they want to keep you far away from their family....  but, they probably eat as much green stuff and berries as anything else.  They might see your dog as potential food, but not you.
Do bears normally dig sitting pits? S/he looks camouflaged so you can lie to me, and I‚Äôll believe it.

God made bears.

And then God made them too dangerous to cuddle.

Will the bear go after the ducky or just watch? What state do you have bears in the yard?
This video is kind of scary! She pretty much disappears! If you weren‚Äôt paying attention, you could end up walking right up on a bear!
He was trying to camouflage and blend in to catch his prey.
The bear's fur matched the dirt so well its perfect camo.

Never realized how cami a bear is. They‚Äôre so easy to spot when they‚Äôre walking around. This fool went fucking predator in his chill pit.

More like to take a nap to me
Some animals do that just before killing their prey 

They wait for the right moment
Watching them thinking about duck stew
This looks like it's at a zoo. Bears in captivity routinely do this. As well as walk in circles constantly because they are stressed. It might look cute, but its sadly not. Not saying zoos are bad either, they do have their place, especially when looking after injured animals. However giving them more space would be more ideal then the tiny pens they are given. Also not destroying and encroaching upon their habitat would be the most ideal option.
This is so fucking sad
:)
Am I the only one saddened that this bear is reduced to having to dig a pit to watch ducks to enjoy the restrictive life it was forced into?
If you've ever been detained before. You start to realize just how good you had it in terms of entertainment. 

Watching bugs crawl around on a floor is something that I do not think I had enjoyed since I was a very young kid.
Lovely
Wow, that camera man must have someone looking out for them. Speaking as a B.S. (bear studies) major, this is what we call a "terror trench". Bears only dig these when they're severely malnourished, and too exhausted to actively hunt. If the bear had seen the camera man, it would have been on him like white on rice.
that do cute!!
what if he is using the bathroom

Smh I should of been a bear and not a human. Here I am at the office and this bear is living life.
Okay Tony Soprano
This was a simple need
I want to be a bear
How did you get this footage of me? I'd be outraged if I wasn't so content watching these ducks.
Just to clear up some misconception, this Northern Mallard Bear is not actually digging a 'sitting pit' but rather digging a whole in which it will lay it's eggs. 

Once she has intubated the eggs she will cover it with dirt and the bearlings will eventually dig themselves out by listening for the sound of ducks outside.
I know it's cute, and that bear is probably there for a reason, but it just makes me feel like it would be happier running through the woods.
"if ducks think I'm ground maybe they'll walk into my mouth."

-that bear, probably
That looks like a good nap.

if this was reversed and title didn't reveal bear i probably wouldn't have even noticed it at first.
I bet that bear would start some shit if another predator showed up to try and feed on those ducks. Unless this is in a zoo.

Nah, that bear is just planning for when the perfect moment is to go get dinner
How do you know that it's a female, did you do a genitalia check? If so, I'd love to know how many limbs you have now.
I read somewhere recently about bears being observed in the wild staking viewpoints to sit and gaze at the sunrise/sunset or a beautiful vista for long periods of time. I appreciate bears a little more than I did before reading about that.

Bears are one of a few species that do things like this- I can't remember the exact study but they were often observed sitting calmly and observing something- a vantage point over a valley, a river, a canyon, for no reason that could be determined other than they liked what they were looking at and they wanted to vibe for a while

plot twist; he's finding a new place to lays his eggs and wait for a ripe snake to cultivate them creating this awful cycle of bears being snakes and snakes somehow being bears

Bears love to dig! At a zoo i worked at we updated the exhibit to be on 12ft of dirt they could dig in and this was pretty much all they did. They would just dig huge holes and take a nap in them, wake up and find a new spot and do it over again
Killer speed bump.
The fact that it dug a hole that deep with sheer strength already tells you not to mess with it.
My dog does this too, it is interesting but also irritating since there is now a giant hole.

I wish bears weren‚Äôt so murdery. I‚Äôd love to cuddle up with that guy.
It's just not fair that they look so cuddly
I fits, I sits: Bear Edition
Ugh, stop it. "Favorite duckies", like you would know.
this just in, bears are big dog-cats.
Karma is real. And with more and more people on this planet we will see more and more animals who are reincarnated humans. It's just science.
Ah hey pal I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs deep enough to hibernate in! Just sayin
Apple iPIT
I swear bears are dogs cousins
Probably depressed out of its fucking mind
Buddha Bear living his best life with the duckies!
And again.. I proclaim, if murderous, why fluffy??
bears are the most adorable beasts on the planet.
LOL about the "Bear" connotations in comments. I recall in my racing lobby there's a guy who went by the handle "Bear" and was quite proud of it. That is until he was informed by some in the lobby of the general association. After that he wanted to change it. Was so funny.
Aww he's bird watching
test
That pun is unbearable.
Cute
Sitting pit or camouflaged ambush point? O.o
repost
I ‚ù§Ô∏è bear
That's dope. Just bird watching. Simple and effective
This was very informative, lol.  Seriously, I had no idea bears did that.
Those type Animals are always dangerous
Now i want a bear....
Do you think Kim Kardashian has a sitting pit in her bed?
I fell into the pit.
I love her. I so wish I could snuggle a creature so beautiful.
That looks comfortable and relaxing.
i like how theres a tiny wire fence keeping the bear in, like that's going to stop a bear that wants to leave lol

Hard life to bear.
chillin
If I sits, I rips.
I feel like this is more of a camo pit. Hoping one of those ducks strays a little too close.
That beat built themselves a duck blind.
Cute
