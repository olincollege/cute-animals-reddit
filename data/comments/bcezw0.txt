From chunk to hunk.

He eats 1/2 cup of diet food per day in about 4 rations. We used to leave out a bowl for the whole day, but he would eat all the food in one sitting. He also eats his brothers food, so we have them eat in separate rooms. 

For exercise we try to play with him daily. We’d sometimes throw food across the room, It got him running lol. I think exercise makes a big difference 

It took about a year, and he is now at a healthy weight for his size. But he’s still obsessed with food 😂

 I know it looks like his eyes changed color, but it’s just the picture
He's wearing black so I never noticed he was chonky. It's so slimming...
Ahhh mannn I wish I could lose 6 pounds by having someone cut my food intake and make me run...
YAS!! I love fat kitties, but I love healthy kitties more. Owners did a great job!
I can practically hear the meowing for food
r/progresspics
I have a male tabby who started at that weight and is now down to about 17.5 pounds.

I think about 14 is a good weight for him too. He’s a big guy, but I know full well he’s still quite fat!

He wasn’t eating his diet food and was losing weight a bit too quickly, so I switched him back to  regular food and leave his dish out in the morning for about and hour and same when I’m home from work. It’s put away at night.

He’s still losing, so I think I’ll stick to that.

I have a female tabby who was a bit underweight, so he had to watch her get regular food and wet food while he was eating his diet food... I swear he’d glare at her while she was eating!

He’s a big softie, so he’d never try and steal her food either, just glare.
still got the same look like " why aren't you feeding me right meow?"
I wish our cat that has gone from 20 to 13 looked this good, but no, somehow he's still a giant fat fuck. No idea how he does it. He eats the same amount as your boy, but in 2 sittings instead of 4.
GEEZ. Imagine losing 30% of your weight as a human! That's pretty dang impressive for a cute kitty cat! Well done, good owner.
Please make a two frame gif so it looks like he is pulsing
***great job getting his weight down!*** Its can be so hard sometimes! I have two boys that like to be piglets but I have really cracked down on their diet and they are also losing weight! your boy looks handsome either way ;)

This guy looks JUST like my Bailey. Black with white chest spot. I call him Father Bailey because it’s like a priest collar. Very similar story, I used to leave food and he would graze all day, he got up to 18lbs before I decided to make a change. Now he’s down to about 11, and much better. A lot easier on me when he sits on my chest, too. :) 

Good on you for loving him so!
Different weight, same expectant head-tilt.
Vet here:  Fantastic job.  This is very difficult to achieve (especially with cats) and is one of the big struggles I have with many of my feline patients.
Chonkn't
Those unhealthy pets people seem to love over at r/AbsoluteUnit should take note
2 things I learned that I need to try here : Start eating in seperate room from husband, and throw food for exercising. 

Thank you OP! 
😅😅👍
I was gonna say this is a repost, and I guess it is, but OP is the original poster from a week ago.

That sweet, sweet karma is truly addictive I guess.
You just extended his life and it will be a much better quality. Great job!
This is really encouraging to see, my grandma has a chihuahua who is very overweight, he’s down one pound since we started (3 months ago) I hope he can get there
My black cat is on a similar journey, 21 pounds to 14.5 now. My guy still has some extra flaps and folds, and he hates being on a diet, but he is living a healthier life.
This weight loss success is the most I've ever been motivated by a cat.
From thicc to slicc
This is the best thing I've ever seen
Now THESE are the cat posts that deserve upvotes, not the ones with pictures of obese cats that are often praised and highly upvoted.  Whenever I see a picture of an obese cat posted, I immediately just feel bad for the cat.
You posted the same a week ago
that's a serious bit of chonk right there, nice to see him slim :)
I wish I’d transform like that after loosing 6 pounds. Sm
My fat ass cat went from 20 pounds to 21 pounds
He still looks at you in the exact same way! I love this!
Oh lawd he comin....

Down in size! Congrats on getting your cat healthy!
Did you teach him to pose for photos? :D

He has the same head-tilt pose in both pics
He looks just like my little guys! https://imgur.com/zKJw4IQ

30% of his body mass. Equivalent to a 200lb man losing 60 lb. Wait that's worrying not inspirational.
Thank you for one of my favorite posts ever - the pics, the background, the comments - fab from start to finish!
He's doing the kato diet
Did he do the Catogenic diet? Heard great things.
Not-so-chonky boy! Yay! He is beautiful!

What are you doing with my cat? 

Seriously he looks just like my boy who also eats like your guy. He's 17lbs right now.
He's a mere shadow of himself! :)

Is his name Shadow, by any chance?
Hmm that's a decent sale I guess. I'll give you 12 and you got a deal.
This is good work, chubby kitties are cute but can have hard times.
Very good boy
who's a little chubby boy!
I like how the cat is in the exact same position in both of these pictures, lol. 

Also, I think thats the feeding time look
He's like me after Christmas! (I wish 😭)

thats adorable!!
My cat looks exactly like this! Even with the little white bib! :')
I see so many black cats with that white dot. is this specific to black cats? is there a reason for this?
The Kato diet works wonders.
I'm trying to accomplish this with one of my cats who is 15 lb - fat for her size. It's hard, she cries like crazy if she doesn't get her "fill". I'm switching to wet food twice a day and using one of those ball things that dispense dry food when played with.
My black cat is 20 pounds and it has been so hard for making him lose weight. He goes to the food bowl by habit
Omg that head tilt! Gorgeous cat before and after.
This is a post I can get behind! Great work OP. Making sure your animals are healthy is important.

All my black cats are/were obsessed with food
Veternarians hate him for using this one simple fat burning trick that they don't want you to know about!
Repost from like a week ago...why?
That’s 30% of his body weight!! For context: that’s like going from 150 lbs to 105 lbs. I am inspired.
Did he ever get annoying? My cat is overweight mostly because when her bowl is empty she HOWLS until we feed her. I know I shouldn’t, but my family can’t stand it so they feed her anyway. I don’t know what to do
And he still seems to fit into his tuxedo
Black is such a slimming color
Such a sleek, svelte kitty!
Good for you helping your cat live a better life. I hate the whole trend of "Look at muh chonky boi!". No, your cat is not a chonk, it's a dying.

I have a female torty who is a bit over weight, well perhaps a bit more than a bit. And I  have no idea how to put her on a diet because I have two other cats. The feeding situation is I just fill their bowls once a day and let them eat when they want. Any suggestions?
I have a cat that put herself on a diet, and she is completely healthy. One day, I guess she decided that she was too fat and needed to lose weight. she lost about 10 lbs and can now jump on my bed.
This is truly inspirational. There’s not enough people talking about cat obesity. Thank you for posting this. Your cat is so very brave for its progress

Thats great! Love the throwing the food but~hey if it works great! Hopefully others currently undergoing a weight problem w their furry friends can be encouraged that all is not lost to help our furry friends live long healthy lives.
From Thicc Boi to Slim Boi
Well done! Trying to do this with my 23lb cat!
I love that he has the same expression in both photos
He's like a question mark in 12pt font and then in 9pt font.
I've resorted to using the bookshelf as well. He's chubby and clumsy where as his brother is thin and athletic so we just feed him extra food on top of the bookshelf. We have to replace it with a shorter one soon so I'm going to have to come up with another plan. My chunk was 22 pounds, he looks much slimmer some days and others I don't notice any change, been holding off on weighing him as I don't want to give him a complex :P

I've cut his food down a full 1\\2 cup a day and he's very self active, plays and chases his springs around the house all day so I really don't know what else to do at this point, just gotta give it time. My skinny cat howls for food all the time, he's a nibbler where as my chunky one never asks or begs for food. If this one would just learn to eat his full portion instead of picking at it we wouldn't be in this mess to begin with.
Before: chubby cute

After: normal cute
Got the same great head tilt though!
Chonky
I wish i can lost pounds like that! (Upvote pls)
how?? my cat is very obese and he isnt losing weight despite his new diet and less food.
TIL that pounds are on a logarithmic scale
Thanks for doing the work it takes to help a pet diet! I adopted a 20lb cat with diabetes but he was too far into it, I couldn’t get his blood sugar levels down enough. It’s so good to see this Mr Man looking trim and healthy!
He went from fat to phat
20 lb = 9.07 kg

14 lb = 6.35 kg

I'm not a bot and this action was not performed automatically. If you have any doubt, please contact u/Llodsliat.
Our Milo went from 16.2 lbs to 13.5 over two years. Not as much of a dramatic transformation, but he has much more energy now!

I have been trying for years to get my 20 pound cat down to a healthy weight!!  

Seriously, I need to learn your secret!
I love this! So many people think fat animals are cute. We need to start seeing overweight and obese animals for what they are; unhealthy. They live longer, happier lives when they are a healthy weight. Just like people.
Great paw-gress!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Good kitty!  She even has her selfie pose down!
Well isn't he a handsome little fella? He was a handsome big fella too, though. <3
This is awesome. You seem to be a great cat owner.
Damm even the floor looks better
r/formerchonkers
Is it wrong to say I like him better when he's chunky?
Did he go on the Catkinson diet?
I thought you stole the post but it’s you just on a different sub. Congrats again!
Does he act differently now he lost weight?
Just to put this into perspective since 6 pounds may not seem like a lot, this is equivalent to a 200 lb man losing 60 lbs and going down to 140 lbs.
awww he ain't chonky anymore tho 😭
If you don't mind me asking. What did you do? Just cut his food racio or what? My cats getting plump and starting to get comments.....
Serious question: How did you manage to control your cat’s weight?
Thanks! I’m trying!
I need to follow his diet plan!

Nice work! It takes some effort to get a pet down in weight. 

I know the satisfaction of getting a pet to a healthy weight - one where they will live a longer and happier life. We got a female choco lab and she weight 93lbs... she's now 65lbs and will live a longer life because of it! Can't wait for her upcoming vet appointment where she will no longer be a 9 out of 9 on the obesity scale.

Edit: let = pet

Ppl at work: "he's back on that shit again"
I need this diet
Great job! Our fat kitty (fat when we adopted her) is a stubborn kitty with the weight loss. She weighs 12-13 lbs, but should weigh around 9. She'll only eat dry food and turns her nose up at anything that isn't crunchy, including treats.

She gets 1/2 cup dry food per day (1/4 2x a day), and I only just now realized that I should think of her food in terms of tablespoons to get an accurate measure of something less than 1/4 cup to help reduce her weight. Maybe I'll start her on 3 Tbsp in the morning and 1/4 cup in the evening to see how that goes.

This is fascinating to me.  I have three cats and I put their dry food in one of those containers that allows the food to flow out through the bottom.  They can eat as much as they want and anytime they want.  Yet none of them overeat.  In the morning I split one can wet food among the three.
Wow keto really works!!!

such a handsome boy!  10/10 would pet.
My parents have 2 dachshunds that are severely obese and can barely move. They sit on the couch all day and pee on the carpet. My mom takes them out every few hours to do their business but they still do it inside all the time. They have food out all day everyday. They don't get excercise because my mom thinks they get too hot so she brings them back inside and very rarely ever takes them for walks. If she does its for very short distances. They bark at literally every fucking thing because they never get excercise and are always bored. They just sleep, eat, shit, and bark all fucking day.

r/notachonkerbecausechonkersarebad
Cant wait till this guy releases his cookbook
*he chunk, now he hunk*
So, how is it that cats develop bad eating habits?  Every cat ive ever had has always "free fed" from a food dispenser.  The thing is like 12 pounds, so basically infinite dry food.   

Theyre all indoor outdoor cats since we live on some acreage, and they run around and exercise a lot, but also eat a bunch of mice and such.

Is the exercise the differentiating factor?   Or do some cats just have poor impulse control like people.

Cato diet?
Cats need a surprisingly small amount of food per day. My girlfriend's cat is rather small and by no means fat, but the vet still insists on her losing a bit of weight. Our automatic pet feeder doesn't even have a small enough portion setting to give the exact recommended amount per serving!

Great work
Even his pupils got skinnier.
What sort of Chonk rehab did you send him to?
From a hefty chonk to a fine boi
Looks like he went on the slim cat diet.
Thicc boi
Awesome progress.  

My cat went from 14 to 11 lbs.  the problem we had was I was giving 2 1/3 cup servings not two 1/4 cup.  So he got way too much food.
My cat recently went from almost 22lbs to 16! We still have a little ways to go until he's not overweight anymore. But I'm so proud!
How did you find [my cat???](https://i.imgur.com/SGFMlJh.jpg)
Are you the same person that posted this 8 days ago and then deleted it, or are you just stealing this post from another? I commented 8 days ago and here it is again...
I’m surprised he still fits into his old tuxedo!
He looked much happier when he was fat
Reverse chonk
I have a fat cat
Wow he looks great way to go!!
That's the same cat!
The Jenny Meow diet?
Beach body ready for the summer ⛱️🌞😊
That’s like a 200 pound human losing 40!
Chunk to cat
He looks a little like my cat :3
He is beautiful! He was a chunk, good on you guys for getting him slim and trim!
Keto Kitty?

How did you get them used to having meal times? Mine are 10 yrs old. One is overweight and he steals his brother's food. The other one is a nibbler. He is a stable good weight but he eats a few bites and walks away, he comes and goes.
Damn, he looks exactly like the cat i had when i was little, she had been declawed and abandoned by her old owners and we adopted her from a shelter, we named her frankie (yes i know weird name but i was 4 and my mom let me pick the name) she became best friends with our dog daizy who was a golden retriever. Sadly they both past away 7 years later, Both from cancer.
OP how did you do this i need to know
Handsome kitty.
That same look. Such a cute head tilt!

I can see that he didn't skip leg day. That's a good kitty.
I thought this was some kind of Instagram reality post
Did he switch to geico?
Way to go!! I’m proud of you!
Low carb, Cato diet?
What a stud! Also he's really got that social media pose going on like a pro.
Wish my cat could do that. She's 6 years old and she's 6 ibs. Poor thing eats but does not gain weight at all
What did you do differently
What did you do?
I love how he still has the same pose.
H e a l t h y b o y e
Let OP see this comment please!! I have a manly black cat that is starting to get a tad too big and would love to help him
He needs to be on r/loseit
What's your trick, not cats 21lbs and all the tricks the vet gave me to slim him down aren't working
Fat Mac/Skinny Mac

But where the hell is dennis?
!!!!!!
wow!
Clap for bobby
I recognize that it's good when cats lose weight, but I think they all look better fat
Fantastic!
Good cat
Fatass.
This cat has really good will power!
He was a cutie as a chunker but now he’s a cute healthy kitty 🐱
That’s a good boi
From Meowser to Whiskers.
Wish I looked this slim after losing 6 pounds
He looks like a sweet boy, glad he's healthier now.  :-D
I think he is cute both ways, but it is a good thing you were able to get him to loose weight

From a hefty chonk to a fine boi

That’s a chuncky boii
Absolute unit to absolute cute kit
If that was due to diet change.  Awesome job.    If they happened on his own, get him to the vet, yesterday.
I need someone to help me do this
This is what happens when you don't let cats outside, they get fat
He was cuter at 20 pounds. A fat cat is a perfect cat
My Evie did the opposite.
this is the only thing that matters in the world.
Woohoo! We just started using a slow eating bowl. One cat is fine, the other is chub chub. She loves food a bit too much. But it's getting better.
GREAT! hopefully adding many more years to his life!
This cat has more hope than I do.
I liked him better before.
He hate you!😂
How, diet and exercise? What brand food?
14 pounds is still a pretty big kitty but I also know breeds vary in size. If your handsome boy is a larger breed 14 pounds makes sense. My girlfriend has 3 and one is a Maine Coon, Freya is a regal house lion.
BRING IT BACK!
Unhealthy ur babies is the worst. Happy about the weight loss
Wow, sooo handsome!
That was one THICC BOI
Respectable man of girth —-> sleek ladykiller
What a good looking kitty. Make sure to tell him How proud we are!
I have the exact same cat. Exact same eyes, exact same white spot and exactly as thick as in the left pic.
He looks like my cat

Looks very similar to my lady Kitty that we called Shady.  All black but a similar white diamond patch under the neck area.  Sure do miss her.

How are you taking such a Non blurry photo of your black cat? its really tough to get a good picture of my little black cat, even with tons of light
Those eyes look like they want food 😍
this is one of those "staring into the abyss, and the abyss stares back" kind of pics...
What a good boi!
/r/absoluteunits
How'd you do it!?
That's what 2 months of slimpuss will do for you.
I see your Black Hole lost mass.
What a handsome boy!
Must be the new low cal mice.
Liked him better when he was fat. Shame :((
he looks fantastic!!!
Awe look at those eyes! Such a cutie 💕🐈
Skinny legend

Wow well done guys! Not an easy feat but you’ve just made him happier and healthier.
I know it's better for him but his eyes were softer when he wasn't hungry.
Fat to fit
This kitty opened Pandora’s box lol
Aww, chonk no more! He's a beautiful critter!
DAMN BOI SHE THICK BOI
The same hate you face
How? My cat is on diet food and reduced portions and she will not lose weight.  If I try to get her to do anything physical she runs to a hiding spot and goes into fight mode
I'm proud of him (:
Awwwww😽😽😽
What a handsome fella!
What's your secret?

He looks 5 years younger.

Then why can't I?!
I see IF 16:8 is working for him. Nice.
you reposted the same picture 8 days later
Handsome 😻
Amazing the difference of 6 pounds.
you already posted this 8 days ago but nonetheless still heckin adorable to see him turn into a fine boi
Please give him a good job pat
I used to have a fat cat that we loved very much. He was a sweet cat, and my parents named him Mojo, but we just called him Momo. He was old, and my parents adopted him when they were just married, as he showed up to their front door. He died a while back, but he was the sweetest cat we knew. He was about 16-17, maybe 18. He was also somewhat heavier than this one. But hey, great improvement! 10/10! Edit: I got some downvotes, and I think I know why. Just to clarify, this post simply reminded me of Mo. He was a good cat, and so is this one. Thanks for understanding. :)

Tell me your secret 😁 We have a chunky boy, and I'd love to know since nothing we've done has worked. He's gorgeous btw :) Such a sweet looking boy
He was 33% reduced
I know this is super vapid, but man I wish losing six pounds went that far for me.
Why can't I be thin after losing 6 pounds? 😣
