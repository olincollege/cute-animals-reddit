My family also just got a new dog it’s name is lobster
She looks like Lady from Lady and the Tramp.
She literally looks like she was created by Pixar
Look at those loving eyes 🥺
Cute dog but fucking weird name
Loveeeee the way she looks at you. Will grow up to be a loyal one, Mark my words.
Omg so cute. Those eyes melt my soul
Cute pup but you're tripping with that name lol
Cute dog but what made you name her Lolita?
I just let out a high pitched squeal in my office. Good thing there's no one else here..
I knew sorting by controversial in this would be spicy.
What kind of dog is she??
Lolita was my mom's name.
[removed]
I'm a bit concerned about that restaurant... gorgeous pup though!
She is so cute!
She has those 'hug me' eyes!
Awwww
I love her and her little blep
A little cutie!!!!!!
[deleted]
I can imagine what goes on people’s heads when they learn about the dogs name.
[removed]
Such a sweet face!!
She is adorable!
So adoreable
this doggie is so wow
If you look at the cross posts apparently only people in r/aww read books lol.

I'm just kidding. Personally I feel Reddit's cultural myopia and holier than thou attitude is on full display here. Half the comments disapproving of the name probably never read the novel anyway...
It’s gonna be weird as hell at the dog park
This thread is a fcking joke god I hate this site sometimes
Man I knew there would be trouble with that name, but this is a very heavy roasting. Very cute dog!
r/blep
 love at first sight
Oh what a gorgeous puppy
blep
Cute floppy ears!
So cute!
r/Blep
r/blep
Cute puppo
that's a good doggo
Please share more photos!
Nice
It’s looking at you ... like, thank you human being, I will be loyal and love you forever.
She's so adorable! What a precious beautiful girl <3
And thus begins another Disney story
Aww
sweet
Reddit is so dumb lol
Don't worry OP, the name is fine. My family is not from the US and everyone calls my aunt Dalores "lolita"

And if you ever do get concerned about the name for any reason call her Lola. Very cute dog by the way.
Controversial name brother
What type of breed is this?
that glimmer tho
I would love that dog into Oblivion!
*blem*
We just got new puppy too! Yay!
The cutest blep there ever was
Omg she looks so soft :(
Could that be anymore cute!
This is amazing I’ve been staring at this for 5 hours
Awwwww!!!! What a sweet little baby! That little tongue oh my goodness
What a beautiful little doggie.  She looks so soft, I can see plenty of hugs and cuddles at your place.  Congratulations <3
That dog is fucking adorable
Just lost both of my long hair dachshunds this summer.  Both had very long lives.  They are the best part of dog and cat mixed.  

You: Want to go an a walk?

Dog: Ok.  

You: How about play with toys?

Dog: Thats fun

You: Can we just lay on the couch today and watch tv?

Dog:  I'll be right here on your chest or under your blanket.
all I care about now is that dog as a good life
I need a man that looks at me like this dog looks at its owner
Wowww so cute
aaaaand I melted away. again.
That was my dogs name! She passed away sadly in January of last year. She was a black lab.
OP please for the love of all that is good, change that poor baby's name
[deleted]
Frame this picture!
That's the look of a trust blep alright. She loves you already
Lolita is such a cute puppy.
This is the cutest picture ive ever seen. (Except ny dog's pictures)
Wow. So beautiful
She's so cute!!!
SO GODDAMN CUTE
So cute 🥰
Please give me that dog.
I wanna boop her nose (ᵔᴥᵔ)
Hi girl!
well that is a one damn cute doggo
My heart just broke into a million pieces. ❤
She’s so cute and adorable! Look at those eyes she loves you already!
Omg ! She's precious
This is so cute!!
Shes precious :3
Dog is too damn cute
So cute!
That looks like a happy puppy there.
She said "blep"
Aww. "We are friends, right hooman?"
Adorable pup, don't worry about the name. It's a nice name, and while it will definitely raise some eyebrows with English speakers, it's not on you to defend it, but instead on them to realize that different cultures have different associations to different names.
How sweet is she??
Fuck all people hating on the name. 

It’s a pretty common name in spanish speaking countries. 

The novel so many reference literally just takes a Hispanic name, Dolores and it’s diminutive Lola/Lolita. The name is perfectly clean you sick fucks. 

FYI, “Dolores” stands for she who suffers pain, and references the pain of mother Maria, a name which stands for sweetness, charisma and great force of will.
Adorable dog!

Name needs works. I mean, sure, you could name a dog Adolf because you had an uncle with that name or because you are a huge fan of:

Adolf Anderssen (1818-1879) Chess Player.

Adolf von Henselt (1814-1889) Composer.

Adolf Erik Nordenskiold (1832-1901) Botanist.

The problem, however, is that the name is going to invoke thoughts of Hitler. Immediately. Akin to Lolita invoking thoughts of the Kubrick film about fucking children.
This whole comment section *actually* believes that the only language spoken in this world is english and that we all share the same literary culture. Lola/Lolita is just a normal name in spanish speaking countries for example, for whoever is wondering.

Is reddit really that full of kids nowadays, or is it just self-centeredness and stupidity?
How about just Lola? She is so pretty and sweet, but the name is going to just create so many awkward situations for you.
*Blep*
I was about to comment on the dog’s cute little blep. Needless to see I was taken a bit by surprise with the comments. Talk about a debate!
Beautiful dog
r/DisneyEyes, r/eyebleach
She is beautiful, and that is one of the sweetest photos I have ever seen. I wish you both many happy years together.
I am admittedly NOT a dog lover, but this little sweetheart tugged at my heartstrings.  Enjoy OP!
Shes beautiful.  Congratulations on your new furbaby.  🥰
It’s seems like everyone read the book except me lol Lolita is nickname for Dolores in a lot of Spanish household. My family has a couple of Dolores and where called Lolita when they were young.
Not everyone has read the book or know of its existence. They most likely don’t know the context behind  that name or their family/friends. If they did, someone would’ve told them lol


Beautiful dog btw! Such a cutie!
Her ears look so soft!
Clearly, a well engineered, solid, sticky lint roller will be essential for you and your family moving forward.  And they are worth every single stray hair.   : )
"hey, got any foooood?"
mlem
i have a cat named Chicken, and another named Stephen Purry
Lovely Lolita\~
Oh.. I see you have joined the "Everything Black Shows You Have a Puppy at Home" club.

Welcome friend.

Blep
Breed?
Man, I bet she's going to be big (big looking paws for being a puppy)
Is Lolita a type of spaniel?
soooooo cute :)
r/dogsmirin
Beautiful animal. Love dogs.
She is so cute, she needs all the hugs
Blep
She's a real cutie! Congratulations.
My neighbor’s cat had a small black spot under its nose. So they named him “Hitler”.

Moral of the story: there can always be a worse name.
r/blep
Oh man, I already knew what all the comments were going to say.

Sorry about your sexy puppy, OP.
Lolita ....🕵🏻‍♂️
Yeah, the name's controversial because of *that* book. But you people seem to be forgetting that Lolita is a common Spanish name/nickname, dating back long before the book.

If OP had named their dog Lolita in honor of the book, then yeah that'd be suspicious, but they explained in another comment in this thread that that's not the case.

Yet another instance where Redditors display their cultural ignorance by assuming that everyone else is American. SMH.

u/jela_03, don't listen to the haters.

EDIT: Seeing other people in this thread getting downvoted for pointing out the same thing just proves my point.
edgelords not knowing that the name Lolita in Spanish existed before it was given a negative association to it.
Cute dog tho, but the name...
Big blep
Boop the snoot
Just look at those huge trusting eyes! What a sweetheart.
Mlem
Beautiful.
All i can think about is the cheap trick song because it’s so good, not the connotation. I’ve been spared
Woooww they got a chocolet nose !!!
(I use they becus idk if it is a he or a she)
With a name like that I assume you got a puppy because "Free Candy" on the side of your van stopped working.
Bro your dog looks like she literally just stepped out of a Disney film! She's so precious! 

Breed?😭
hello Lolita :)
These eyes have seen a lot of loves, but they’re never gonna see another one like I had with you
Oof. That name tho.
Oh wow, this is totally r/dogsmirin
Two questions, what breed is it and why is everyone freaked out over the name?
The weebs are really concerned right now
You can see the love for you in those eyes. So precious
Adorable, those puppy eyes are something else ;)
So CUTE!
All the belly rubs and kisses. I must give her all of them!
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
She’s gonna be a feisty girl.
Shouting 'Loli!' 'Loli come here!' At the park might get you some weebish stares.
The pup is so cute I wanna punch myself
Sweet baby 🥺
😍 Aww! She’ so adorable! The way she’s looking at you is so cute!
Wait what's the breed? Such a cute doggie aww
Man when I think of Lolita I think of Japanese street fashion. It just seems that everyone thinks differently of the name Lolita.

Op did not seem to have bad intentions so please don’t drag them down.
Yeah I'd go with a different name
It's a name that OP didn't even know was associated pedophilia, and guess what? Most people don't. I know you guys have nothing better to do and like to feel so knowledgeable and holier-than-thou, but just leave OP alone. It's not like they named their dog Adolf or Dahmer.
Aww, what kind of doggo is that? Is she still a pupper?
bloop
Hello Lolitas share love to your new home you are such an adorable dog!
So precious !!!
Lol, the looks like she loves you already. She's beautiful 😍 !!
YOU name YOUR dog whatever YOU fucking want. Fuck these people with their opinions. 

Lolita is a lovely pup. Congrats !!
See also: Reddit is reminded that not everyone is American
That's the stupidest possible name.
Cute dog but I'd seriously consider changing that name! Oh man.
op's next post will be on r/tifu: "TIFU by naming my dog..."
Showed this to my SO and she almost started crying about how cute the dog is. She told me we're getting a dog.
So sweet. Lots of petting, treats, & toys.😘
haha she is doing a :p
That is a creepy name for a dog, dude.
The name tho
It gives me the creeps
Blep
The puppy looks like they pulled her straight from a disney movie or something
BECAUSE SHE'S JUST SO CUTE
My heart just stopped
Wah! So cute! Tiny pink tongue!
Oh she is precious!! love her little face.
Sooooooo cute!!!!!🐕🐾
My baby does this too because he’s missing some bottom teeth! The tongue out is my favorite, especially when you boop it! 😍
Ridiculous cuteness looking up at you❤️
So cute 🙂
I thought no one on Reddit was beautiful but say that no more I will
Lolita is a super pretty name for a dog!! Also for fuck’s sake it’s just a name people just get over whatever connotation you’re giving it!! There’s still a lot of people named Lola out there in the world and it’s not their fault that book exists
Lol at everyone here gatekeeping a bloody name. Get the fuck over yourselves. The name existed before that novel and isn’t only associated with that. 

If you find it a weird or inappropriate choice that says so much more about yourself than OP.
Lolita is adorable! Congratulations !! ❤ And, I love that name, too.
Very cute dog and also very cute name. I am shocked about the people that want you to change the name. Call her what you want and Lolita is a very cute sounding name and that it is named after a restaurant is funny. Hope you have much fun with your new family member!
Who cares about the name. She is so cute. Look at her looking at you.
[This thread.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3zdYUG2_RA)
Who's a good girl? You're a good girl, and you're adorable!!
I like your dog and you can name her anything you want as long as you like to give her scritches when you call her.
I think you should rconsider the name
Fuck the haters I love the name!
Ugh just stop with all the dumb name jokes. It's a pretty name. Which just happened to be the name of a girl who was fucked by her stepdad in a novel. So what? Oh sure the world is all about English speaking countries. Well in Japan Lolita fashion is just gothic/cutesie Rococo fashion. Not everyone has to read an English book and understand that a name has certain connotation in English
OP, please post a parent comment (so it can be upvoted to the top) where you explain that in your culture and where you live, the name Lolita doesn’t hold the same connotation as it does for 99% of the people who are commenting. Would save you and everyone else from having to continue reading comments with the words “kiddy fucker” or some variation.
Creeeeeeepy name dude... [Definition](https://www.google.com/search?q=definition+lolita&rlz=1C1OKWM_enUS793US793&oq=definition+lolita&aqs=chrome..69i57.3295j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
That's a very questionable name
If you are offended by OP's dog's name, wait till you learn what H.P. Lovecraft called his cat.
Not everyone has read the fucking pedo book. It's a nice name.  
  
Also the pup is the sweetest!
Congratulations on the look little cutie. Uhm, why the name though?
Such a cutie I can’t deal 🥰🥰
Hewooo beautiful!!!!! Congrats on your new happily furever after!!! I know you’ll take care of your hooman, I see the love in your eyes!!!! 🥰
Here’s my puppy, Lolita. What? All my pets are named for figures in books. Here are her cousins, Injun Joe, Shylock, and Uncle Tom.
Ugh. So much negativity in this thread.


People, names have different meaning 😱😱😱😱😱 honestly. I never heard of this book before, probably because is not a worldwide known reference 


 Cute dog and cute name, I want to hug her
Cute dog, but uh... awkward name
Yikes. Weird name - might want to rethink that one before night two.
Cutest pup with the cutest name <3 
Ignore the ape headed "bad thing bad" people.
Maybe shorten her name to Lita
Dumb name, Epstein.
Cute pup. Fucking weird name.
You should look up the name of Epstein's sex plane.
Happy blep❤️
It's not too late to change that name.
bro what
You can tell that the majority of Reddit users are American in this thread
Uh.. bold name
Lola looks like a showgirl!
Oh my goodness! She is GORGEOUS!!
Mirin
The blep ^^
mlem
She heard the boom you didn’t

Also. Can I steal your pup for a walk?
This should be a painting- it’s adorable!!
Look at that little mlem 😍
r/ntbdbiwdfta
Is she a long-haired dachshund? Maybe it's the lighting, but she seems tk have a unique color. The closest I can think of would be chocolate, but she is lighter - almost a caramel. Very cute!
Light of my life, fire of my loins.
Epstein's dog had to go to someone y'all.
*Blep*
Aww look at them eyes...
Blep
Is that a toller by any chance?
Humbert will be happy she's not going out with boys.
My dog name is Simba and he so cute☺️
You're probably going to have a lot of fun the first time she runs from you in the park and you start screaming LOLI LOLI! Amazingly cute dog though!
100% of the comments: What a cute dog 🥰

Also 100% of the comments: That name tho 😡 

OP, you do you
Lolly might be a better, cuter name
Fun fact “Lolita-dukke” is the danish word for “sex doll”. With “dukke” meaning doll. 
Cute dog though.
I love the dog and the name. Don't pay attention to people sexualizing it. That is on them.

By the way, that look of complete trust melts your heart.
Perhaps you should call her Lola instead?
ttthat nname. ii rrrememmber
In general, I often think redditors will regret the names they give their dogs. It’s always like “Meet Chrysanthemum,” and I cant help thinking they overthought it
Yall this dog is hella cute and a name is a name tho. The puppy is cute and thats all that matters.
So by many peoples logic. If there is a book. And its horrible the name should be "banned" cus ppl will only think of said book?
Please first thing I thought of was the french word.
Just imagine the owner calling for his dog.
Super cute dog, but oh boy that name...
I would name her Lily, just saying.
Awwww😍😍😍💋💋❤️❤️❤️
What a strange choice of name.
Another post to say gorgeous dog, terrible name.
Research the name and then pick a new name. Idiot
... Maybe Lola in public, lol.
Lolita would probably get on well with my dog, Epstein
Just a pup...so not too late for a name change.
I’m literally squealing rn.

Adorable dog, but oof to that name
Terrible name
Change her name to Lola, it will be better for you in the long run
May I suggest calling her or changing that name to Lola?
That name is cringey
[removed]
Dude, do the whole world a favour.  Change your dogs name. It's creepy af!
Cute pic, weird name dude.
Why did you name your dog after child porn?
If guy named Humbert Humbert shows up, *run*
Uh might wanna reconsider the name mate
Yeah, you shouldn't call your dog that.
Lolita is a weird fuckin' name for a dog.
What a crappy name for a cute dog
Awww, she is a pretty girl :D Fitting name <3

Please keep posting updates! she seems she will become a great silly dog!
When is her brother Epstein coming home?
You mean to tell me there are other people outside of the United States who may have different meanings for the same word? 
Absurd! 

/s
Oof very odd choice for a dog name haha

Have you read the book or just heard the title?
Precious pup but problematic name for sure. I’m wondering how this comment thread is gonna go 😂
Name is super creepy
You named your dog Lolita??
Lolita? **Jeffrey Epstein breathing intensifies** Lol
Lolita? The name of the victim of a pedophile in the book Lolita? That Lolita?
[removed]
Lolita is so precious
Damn let her name her dog whatever tf she wants damb!!!
lovely name
Why on earth would you name it that?
eww excuse me wtf is that name. change her name pls
OP you really need to change that dog's name.
Dude, I love the dog but did you seriously name it 'a sexually precocious young girl'?
Cute dog! The name is a little cringey
Nice

I wish I had a girl that looks at me like this. Actually I wish I had a dog that looks at me like this.
God. Change the damn name. That's awful.
Please change the name
Poor doggy with that name 😔
interesting name
Dear god that name...
At least it's easier to rename a pet then it is a kid
Errr...that's a name all right.
Lol cute dog but you fucked up with that name.
Lolita is not the way to go. Lola.
cute dog. gross name 😒
Why did you call your dog lolita?

The book by the same name is about a pedophile. Possibly the most famous pedophile book of all time.

I tried reading it, but it was disturbing. I dont understand it's high praise.
Weird ass name choice man, change it before it’s too late. That shit might give ppl some weird ideas about you
Police: Excuse me, what are you doing?

OP: I'm looking for my lost Loli

Police: You need to come with us...
shes cute but that name...
Cutest doggo but maybe change her name to Lola or Lili ?
cute as the day is long, but not a name I'd give a dog tbh
Who calls their dog Lolita?
Is this epsteins reddit account?
Time to change the name lol
Lolita the pedophile dog
Creepiest dog name ever. Kinda like naming your dog jail bate or statuary rape.
Lolita..... that’s fucking interesting name to name a pet to say the least.🤨

Just so everyone knows The meaning for Lolita is a sexually precocious young girl.
[removed]
https://youtu.be/4kYtw_XOLhc

You can sing this song to her!

Stereophonics - Lolita. Lovely song
Lolita definition: “sexually precocious young girl.” 

Has the dog been saved or enslaved into a life of some kind of sexual deviancy?? Odd name for a dog.  I vote for a name change to Lola.
[deleted]
You called your dog Lolita?

…

…

…that's not a great choice.
I feel really sorry for OP. I can understand because if the book has never been on your radar until now, you probably think it’s a niche thing and that it’s not going to be an issue going forward, but I would be willing to be OP is going to be hearing a lot more about this book going forward AND be getting a few weird/cold responses when she calls her dog/tells people its name.
Hey don't listen to all the haters. Call your adorable puppy however you please ❤️ ofc as long as it's not an insult 😂
Everyone you know is 100% going to assume you are a pedo now having named your dog that lol.
In Spanish, Lolita is a nickname for Lola, which is a nickname for Dolores. All of you are judging this person based off your English white-centric bullshit. You’re all racists. Shame on all of you for this microaggressive bullshit.
Stupid name cute dog!
Big oof on the name.
Came here for the comments, not disappointed. I vote Lola, haha
Why would name your dog that?
have....have you read Lolita?
unfortunate name choice.
You haven't read lolita huh?
Yes hello FBI? Yeah, I think I just found Jeffery Epstein.. yeah I’ll hold
Change it’s fucking name.
You Jeffery Epsteins family?
Lolita? lol.
Lolita? really?
Change it to Lola
please don't fuck your dog
r/Suddenlysexoffender
Really weird name choice there, bud.
What the fuck is wrong with you people? It's a name. A name that many perfectly decent women and girls have.
Lolita said "M L E M 🥰" and my heart has never been warmer 🥺🥺🥺
Lolita is sexualized children.
What the fuck is that name. 

Change it please.
Lolita, light of my life, fire of my dogpillow. My cuddle, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.

She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, playing with one sock, she was Lola during eating. She was Dolly at dogschool. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.
You named your dog a creepy name
Bad timing for the name lol
Interesting name choice given its definition

Edit: lol Lolita is a general term for promiscuous prepubescent girls, but alright. Guess that's been normalized /s
Why the hell would you name anything Lolita  weirdo? Most people have heard of the novel now.


Edit- try Google you downvoting bums
"If I am lolita then you are a criminal"
Imagine shouting that name at the park, you would be killed where I live
Lolita? It sounds like you're going to fuck that dog weirdo
Lolita? Really? Same name as those blow up sex dolls...
Cute dog, ooof on the name
That POOR dog...having a name like that...
Cool name, it's my fav song 😎

https://youtu.be/zfXBNQMj2SE
Lolita! 😂
Whomever named her that might not be a pedo, just like someone who names their dog Adolf might not be a Nazi.
Wait til she gets out and you have to walk thru the woods at 1am after the fireworks yelling "Lolita"
Name it like something else. Its just not even a good dogs name even looking past the connotations. 

Way to many syllables
Omfg that is the most cringe name for a dog
Lolita Express
Lolita express you named your dog after a sex traffic plane 🤔
I bet that dog gives great massages!
Please don't fuck the dog
