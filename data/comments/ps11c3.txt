Ohhh, the greying mask on that sweet dog!
And he is RIGHT.
We need you to post pictures of them every day.
They look so relaxed and happy together. Sweetness.
I mean, he's obviously correct. That's his kitten. You got him a pet. 🥺
What are their names?!
You did, didn't you
I've got a mastador (54kg big boy) and when we brought home a abandoned kitten he sat with her like this for hours the only difference is he was so excited he was shaking so much it sounded like a earthquake in the house. We have a couple of other cats so he loves them and thinks he is a cat.
A pet for your pet. Did you teach him all the responsibilities of owning a pet? 😂
[Here](https://imgur.com/a/unwrQ44) are a few more photos of Guinness and Artemis, as well as some with the puppy he helped me raise last year. 
He’s 3/4 American Staffy and 1/4 German Shorthair Pointer, 11 years old, and he’s super quirky but super sweet and just loves babies.
Always love to see a healthy, old dog been taken good care of.
What a sweet old man. His smile is heartwarming.
Wow! First time I see a dog that looks exactly like ours with the colors and the ears. Except ours is less grey around his eyes. Guess we will also have a panda dog soon. Love it!
He's gonna be the best grandpaw. ❤️
Beautiful puppy
God damn beauty has come with age for this distinguished gentleman
I instantly saw venom on that dog grey
"cat is pack and i teach awoo!"
"Just what I always wanted. My own little bunny rabbit. I will name him George, and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him..."
Ohh my that's a good puppy dog
Very sweet boy. Young at heart ❤️.
Awwwwww….. Made my day 💕.    They’re a sweet pair.
I really think, based on observation only, that getting a puppy or kitten when you have an aging dog extends the life of the aging dog.

They get that puppy energy back and naturally get more exercise and cognitive activity interacting with new arrivals like this.
So looks like my girl Coco. She was with us for 16 years. Hug your dogo for me.
I only regret that I have but one upvote to give
What a beautiful old man, we just lost my childhood dog and he had a gray beard just like this one. Make sure you cherish the time you have with him.
He is a proud adoptive parent
I have a catahoula and he looks just like this boy just 7-8 years younger. Brought tears to my eyes looking at this sweet boy
A dog trainer taught me that lip-licking in dogs is usually a sign of stress… combined with the ears pulled back here and that he doesn’t seem to want to make eye contact with the kitten I would guess that this older cutie is uncomfortable with the kitten being right there and is looking for some reassurance.
Hes so happy, this dog has been well looked after I can tell
I like how the cat is slowly realizing play time is over,

but the spot is actually pretty comfy.
This vid is so beautiful. I love that dog and am so glad you got that kitten just for him.
My old man had a similar face. He didn’t like cats or dogs which was strange. In return he gave me a friendship that I’m scared I’ll never be able to get again with another dog. It’s been 2 years now since I put him down. I think about him all the time. Give your boy a hug for me!
Who's a good boy? You are! You're a good boy! Beautiful kitten, she's just gorgeous.
Please give that ole boy some extra love from Texas.
That video is adorable……❤️❤️❤️
Dis for me?
So precious 💜
From the look on the kitten, I think you did!
I'll be the first to admit that I can't stand cats. The markings on this one, however, make me want to play with him. Maybe it's the Halloween colors. Maybe it's the good dog who also needs some scritches. In any case, Aww!
Why is this only a 30 second video?! I could watch this all day!
My little pup looks just like him!!! What is the breed? I’ve been trying to figure it out for years!
Ghost Face!!! We love the senior doggos!
Mixed feelings.

The dog is adorable but he also immediately made me think of *Venom*.
Can we just have a subreddit of these two?! That’s one I would gladly join and watch every day
You did though… didn’t you? 🥰
My dog ​​LOVES cats, right now she's crying beside me because the cat I feed almost every night has decided to sleep here, but she can't go play with her. 

I'm thinking about taking this cat to the vet, it showed up here without an eye, but it all depends on my parents' mood when I ask. She's so calm and well-behaved, to get my attention she pretended she had an injured paw but in the middle of the performance she forgot which paw it was, so she stayed 1 minute straight changing paws until she gave up lol
In my experience, elderly animals become *extremely* lonely in their old age. Even if they seemed fine on their own before. It happens over and over.

If you're likely to continue pet ownership (or even fostering) after your bestie passes, consider bringing in the new friend *before* they pass. That way, they can receive that extra companionship you can't provide every waking minute of the day.

Seriously. My old boy of 17 years needs to always be in a room with people or animals. When no one is around (or he thinks he's alone) he'll howl and "mrooOOooww" in the most meloncholy deep voice you've never thought a cat capable. It honestly sounds like mourning or weeping.
That dog looks quite anxious, not cute. That's why the ears are back and it's licking its lips and panting...
Surely you did?
He’s just a hap-ee happy boy he’s just a happy happy happy boy
He looks like deadpool 😳
Thank you! 

I'll eat this later.
Is food???
Because you did! You adopted the kitten just for for that good boy!
He reminds me of Pixar’s Dug. “Oh I love the puppy cat. Thank you poppa!”
That dog is a handsome boy!
What a bright fella
You did. You just don’t know it yet.
Awwww!!
Didn’t you though?
Besties, perfect match.  ♥️♥️
looks so sweet
Of course you did. Why would you if not for him??
Aw
lookat that beautiful silver mask!!!! so handsome.
“I mean, thank you, I like it, but is there a less scratchy version?”
Yeah, I'm going to need to see a couple hundred more pictures of these two.
Looks like he aint wrong.
He’s happy he has a new friend
Awww they best friends :) Your doggo looks like a big ol sweetheart
U mean....its not just for him?  Cuz he totally deserves one.  Such a good boi!
LOL

But… you did. Obviously.
The Good Boi: ”Dis my cat”

The Cat: "I claim this dog as my own"
What? You didn’t? I think you did.
You did tho
And eventually they’ll both think you did - and that’s such a good thing!
He looks very happy to have a little sister!
It was for him
Deadpool Doggo
That is now his baby, you cant tell that cute face that isnt his ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
Calicos are so beautiful and cheeky looking
after a lifetime of lonliness... joy
I mean...didn't you???? So sweet 😍😍😍
He’s not wrong
He looks like a really good doggo.
"This kitten thinks the old boy was there just for him to play with"
Wow this post has so many awards! Deservedly so!
He is so cute, and k think he really does think its for him
That sweet face.  (Didn’t you get the Kitty for him?  Please don’t tell him if you didn’t. 🥺)
You did. It’s his kitten now
That old boy is greyer than my beard.  Good for him, hope he enjoys his new toy.
You did, you just don’t know it yet.
<3 <3 <3 <3 love them
He looks so happy, i wouldn't have the heart to tell him that the kitten is for everyone.
"Thinks" hell, that's clearly his kitten. I love the old boy and that he has a new friend.
OMG!   I love his old gray face.  What a good boy!
You did, didn’t you?
He looks just like my 10 year old black lab.  Makes me smile watching yours.
I like this, this is mine
Did you do anything special to introduce the cat to the dogs? Was there ever any concern about them not getting along? I have a 5 year old Husky and I would love to get a kitten someday to keep him company but I don’t know how he would react to a cat. He’s mellow and generally sociable but I would be devastated if things played out in some worst case scenario.
Probably nothing major but sound would of made this video good
In this video you have 2 animals.. one is a vicious killing machine.. the other is a pitbull... lol
Aww just look at him!
Grand ole man - everything for him!
r/kittypupperlove 🥰
Because you did!
That is HIS baby, don’t you dare say it isn’t!
Well you did, didn’t you?
Oh she belongs to him now you just don’t know it yet.
Are you telling me you didn't adopt it for him you monster???
The white around the dog's eyes remind me of Venom
So sweet.  I love this.  We should all be more like dogs and cats.  Not chasing each other or licking buttholes.  Just love between our differences.
Your dogs white patch on his chest looks kind of like a bone and it’s really cute!
So sweet omg 😭😭😭
“Play with me dawg.” - kat
Kitten: "come on, let's play!"

Dog: "hold on. Hoomans are doing a thing."
I don't know if anyone's posted this, but your doggo looks like an orca!
You should have given him a pet years ago
Grandpa dog doesn't want a kitten 

Family get kitten anyway 

Grandpa dog and the kitten:☝️
you know thats his cat now right?
More like you got the kitty a sweet old Abuelito.
That is the sweetest looking dog. I love him already. What a gem.
Meanwhile kitten thinks you got old boy just for them -  “really my own personal real life play toy??”
I like his goggles.
I just OD’d from cuteness overload
Well it's his now. He's the papa lol
They are both SO beautiful, especially him 😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰
That is a good looking old man right there. Old dogs are the best.
That dog aged beautifully
Just a heads up your cute old pooch may or may not be in cahoots with a symbiotic alien named venom
I like his goggles.
Are you implying you DIDN’T adopt a kitten just for him?
"aww I love my new Kittie " no you see it is actually " MY new Kittie"
Did you not?
Who else would it be for? It’s pretty evident. It’s his and his only, so…?
He looks so happy 😊
It's Spawn-dog!
Calico are just the best cats. Full of attitude but undying love.
He has the Spawn look! Such a good chap!
You didn’t buy it for him? Too bad it’s his now
u/anon_canon123
ah having a crap day at work already, this made my day so much better! :D
r/OldManDog
Keep the new kitten, I want that handsome old boy! He's got the most beautiful face, expressive... ❤❤❤❤🐾🐾🐾
So cute he’s loving on the new addition to your family. I love it ♥️
WAit is that a PITBULL BOXER LAB MIX BECAUSE IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE MY DOG AND I MEAN EXACTLY WHERE THE WHITE IS THE GRAY AND THE PAWS THE MANNERISMS
Well didn’t you?
Uhm.  You did.
Just a grandpa dog loving on his adopted grandkitty.
Of course you did. You just didn't know that you did.
I think it's great that this old man is embracing the new kit on the block.
That (doggie) smile!!!
Lovely friends..
lol I know, it's like he's saying "Get outta here; it's mine."
Cutie!

Couldn't help but think of this...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI4yoXyb1\_M
Pretty sure you did. I would.
Absolutely a sweetheart my dog so wants me to get a cat always trys to play with any he meets usually disappointed though
Torties are the best! Love her face. Cute dog too, but I'm a cat person and am mainly here for that kitten.
I dare you to tell him otherwise! Too cute!
How did you get your kitten to like your dog? We just rescued a kitten and he is absolutely terrified of both of our dogs. Luckily we have a lot of places for him to go so he doesn't have to be around them, but I still want them to have a good relationship. I'm hoping that when kitten gets bigger he'll feel more confident around them since he's quite small rn.
Big dogs being gentle and patient with kittens is one thing that will *always* make me smile.
r/kittypupperlove would love this so much. Can't believe no one recommended that sub yet.
We had an older (10) German Shepard, Jack, and we adopted a beautiful tabby kitten, Jill, at the beginning of the pandemic. Jack and Jill. I only wish Jack could have had more time with his friend. They loved each other so much.. She will come running over to me when I take his old collar out of the plastic bag that I put it in to save his smell, or many of the times I would find her laying down on his blanket during the middle night after he had left us. Cherish those moments please.
Old Mr. Doggo there looks wise beyond his years.
"I can't wait to eat this kitten." -Dog probably
This made me shed happy tears. I lost my girl back around Christmas, I remember when we got our kitten, watching this same scene. Thank you for sharing.
They're brothers now
Just perfect 🥰
What a sweet old man :)
that's because you did
didn’t you??
r/oldmandog
OMG. Old bois are the sweetest bois!! Kitten loves him too!
“Finally some good fucking food” -Dog
That kitten is starting to accept the pupper as a parent. You can actually see that fact dawn on the kitty if you watch closely.
That’s a beautiful dog! And floof too.
The title of your post implies that you did not, in fact, adopt the kitten for your doggo...  but I'm confused because that kitten has clearly been claimed by the doggo and does, in fact, belong to the doggo.  

Nice try hooman.
I love this! Please give old boy some good belly rubs from us all!! 💕💕💕
Is his name zoro
Pit-labs are some of the cutest dogs ever. Their baby faces and white chest.
Please tell me the dog’s name is panda
The dog looks like venom
https://youtu.be/kI4yoXyb1_M
He’s not wrong 🤣
I love how well their markings match, clearly they are family.
Omg wow, they have both such beautiful coats!!
It's his kitten now
Help !  I need insulin!
He's got a little buddy!
Awww, he's super cute, I love his white mask. The kitten is also beautiful, congrats!
Aww is an understatement.
How precious ! But didn’t you? I mean he’s obviously responsible enough and taking wonderful care
Oh man, he’s sooo damn happy!  Just say it’s for him
I couldn’t tell him no with that look.
That's his baby  new purpose in life
Aww, I'd legit pay you to snuggle that sweetheart x
You can see the family resemblance
He is absolutely right
Didn’t ya?
Silvery snoots = best snoots
OMG your dog is ADORABLE!!!!
What an absolutely beautiful boy ♥️
This is so precious!
That's so sweet,  he looks like a big gentle baby.
Doggo is like: Nope. This my kitty now.
That is one comfortable, trusting kitty to expose her belly like that.  Love it.
Woahh handsome old boy !!!😍😍😍
So cute
What a good pupper! I have been trying to teach my little poodle to be kind to kitties. So thankful the neighbor has a chill and patient cat!
Well, didn’t you?
Outright The cutest thing I've seen all year.
You mean you didn't? Oh don't tell him, he'll be so disappointed!
You dog has got a spicy puppy.
Awe, what a handsome old friend.
Well didn’t you?
He loves his new baby
Awww, how sweet is that
❤️
That's his kitten now
Best friends 😂
 I love it, thank you for sharing.  Your dog looks completely in love.
Such a beautiful old doggo !!
His wee face!! He’s so happy with his new babe!
they are so sweet
And if you think differently then you’re crazy. Lol. That’s his cat now. His pet, he will love it and care for it. But you get to clean the litter box😆
AWW, love this, what a sweet gentleman. My old boy has the same white hair on his face as your old boy! He's going to be 12 next month.
ok sweetest thing ive seen today
The stars in his eyes :D he must have seen so much what a happy old boy
How soon did he start to get the white mask, if he's only 11 now?  Our girl looks a lot like him and will be 7 next month, and she has a mask starting to come in.
I know that I sound like an idiot asking this but what is the breed of that dog?
Didn't you?
Best boy
I can keep it?!
Thanks mom for my new toy. I like the way it moves.
This fills me with a wholesome feeling. I love old dogs and this is so precious. Old dogs are angels.
😩 there’s dogs and then there’s old friendly dogs ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh can’t handle it. So much love. All dogs, of course, but old friendly dogs man. My heart.
Didn’t you??
Are your sure you didn't? He looks pretty wise.
How can a dog be that cute 🥰
We are VENOM
I love this so much!
I mean, you did, right?
Ooooooh he is so beautiful! Do you know his breed/mix?
What a sweetheart!
What a good kitty! :)
My son's German Shepherd is the same way with one of our tabby cats.
Well, didn't you?
You didn't?
We adopted a puppy and we received our human baby just a week before, so we jokingly call our puppy- “Evē’s puppy”!  (We did name him Olivyr but they definitely have their own little language. It’s like we got the puppy just for her.)
I love when cats and dogs get along
i mean, that’s what happened so…
You did you just don’t know it lol
Thanks for the new toy, mom and dad.
They match
Don’t tell me you didnt
He's probably thinking finally a friend lol
Bane
Didn’t you?
“You’ve brought me a child! Finally, I can teach this strange puppy all the tricks I know.”
If that does not melt your heart, you do not have one. Good puppy!!! ❤️
Those precious eyes, I love him so much!!
He is also glad because he doesn't exactly have access to a refrigerator.
We just got a new kitty a yearish ago, and my older blind dog doesn’t seem to like her that much. I think if my dog could still see she would fine with the kitty, because she’s always played with our previous cats and liked them, but now she can’t see the oncoming attack kitty who wants to play
This is precious. What a sweet elderly gentleman.
Awwww a forever friendship!
You did
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval)
He doesn't know it yet but that kitten will become a cat and own him in the same way!
Melted! 😍
Hes so happy ❤️
Getting some serious Spawn (comic character) vibes
What breed is this?
Awww....love him! He has such a pure soul! The kittie is adorable, too!
So does your kitten!
Beautiful puppy
I needed this today.  The smile it generated on me was needed badly.
This is so wholesome
Friendliest dog face I've seen.
That is so cute
Love it!! What a precious, “ole boy!”
They are going to tear shite up, I promise you that!
"Is my kittem get ur own!"
Well, didn’t you adopt the kitten for him? Sure looks like it.
Looks like you’ll have to get yourself another one 😜
He is way to precious!!! I've been thinking about adopting a feline friend for my good boy too.
You did.
Adorable.
That is without question the cutest dog I have ever seen in my life!
Omg he has the sweetest face
What a sweet looking fella!
you didnt!?
Gosh 🥺 his adorable eyes! he keeps looking up like "for me 🥺 ?"
Those two have beautiful markings.  Loving that interaction and the kitten's playful nature.
You did

*this is a threat*
r/kittypupperlove
Aw he’s so sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet 👴🏻
They look like you've walked in on them
awwww old puppy
You did. Even if you don't realize it.
Looks happy
He's beautiful!
Of course the kitten is a little spitfire- she’s a calico
This made my Monday.
Don't you dare let him think otherwise.
You're telling me you didn't adopt him a kitten? He's in mommy mode now
Awe poor old guy is getting cataracts. Send super happy so that’s awesome
Kitten: “Oh good, you prepared a dog for my arrival”
Didn’t you?? (:
Animals  are the best
They're basically family ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
Of your dog's name is not Venom we gonna have a problem
I don't want to be a downer, but have you looked into animal mourning? I'm told there are things you can do to help the cat deal with the loss of the dog friend (when that becomes necessary in the next few years). For cats it's apparently important to smell the deceased family member.
S T A G E D
"Finally...

Some real fucking food around here."

-this dog (descendant of Gordon Ramsay)
He better give her some space though cause she’s gonna slash that booty
BC of course you did!
Boy needs a treat!
Don't tell him
Why would anyone upload this with no sound 😡
,,,
/r/frens
Kitty has a wonderful open guard
Calicos are the best
Ok where is the Instagram account?!
Plot twist: the cat think you’ve got him a dog
EAT
Can you prove otherwise?
What a good boy! I just want to give him a hug.
Awesome
My calico looks EXACTLY like yours. Same black stripe down the nose.
I want to see MORE please make a tiktok 😤
Oh. My. GOD!! My heart 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
Didn’t you, though?
I had such a shitty day but this makes me forget and smile thank u!
Why do i already feel sad for the kitten for when the old boys passes away
Aww his graying eyes are soon cute!!! Looks like he's wearing a mask
Because you did
Oh my goodness!!!!
My cat doesn't like my dog much.. He always, everytime, will try and get a good old sniff of her butt. It's like he can't help it, even with me telling him no when the nose gets close.
She likes her space at the best of times and doesn't appreciate it! I would love it if they chilled together like your cuties.
Well you did right?
You did right?
The new Dogpool movie looks wholesome.
u/eldian_menace the bubuist and mardankeyan forces convene to make peace, circa 2344 a.d
Yes...my older boys think the same....lol
Makes me really want a dog. What a good boy
It's his child
That is the good boy!
Aww how cute
One of the most adorable dogs I’ve ever seen. Oh em g
Omg r/blacksplashnosecats on that sweet baby
That!
This reminds me of that joke in the Ice Age movie about a pet having a pet.
They are both so beautiful! I love this.
Omg i love his mask. He is the cutest. I love old dogs.
Made me smile.
What breed is the old man? My guess is staffy cross labrador, only because he looks extremely similar to my old boy. He definitely looks very happy with the new kitten.
MY HEART
tuxedo mask!!
She has the cutest yellow face (and it’s a calico so most likely her
Didnt you?
Senior dogs rock!!!
she looks so similar to one of my foster kittens
My dog was the same way, sadly he passed and now is cat is not the same.
Love it
Beautiful boy! (and his kitty). My old girl recently passed away and he reminds me of her. ♥️
Good doggie.
OP, our dog is a dead ringer for yours. Like, it’s uncanny and almost weird how close they look alike. Have you had a breed analysis done?

https://imgur.com/a/e5u4L1I/
He’s such a handsome and distinguished gentleman. 🤵🏻‍♂️
Ohhhh só cute
Love the misfits cosplay
💙💙💙💙💙
Alright, this is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen and I wish I had a reward to give you. I shall come back when I do.
But Kitty knows the truth - that you got her just for her good looks and winning personality.
That.is.ADORABLE!!! 😍😍😍
“Look Edgar. I can hold this thing down for now but you have to do something about this.  Or else your couch and Christmas tree are toast. Ok Ed?”
You DID, you did adopt a kitten for this beautiful old boy.
Such a wonderful family right there!
I think it was the kitten that adopted him
So does the kitten
His markings are the cutest!
Awww😍😍😍
Spooky Boy!!!
Same thing happened with our dog when we got a new kitten.
He also probably fell for it when you told him he’s going to live out his retirement on a farm.
I LOOOOOOVE old bbs masks, my 6 y/o has started graying into a mask & I'm almost more obsessed with it than his previously sleek black coat.
Holy shit. That looks exactly like my cat!!
But…….didn’t you?
They look so cute together 🥰
Man I hope they named that dog venom
I didn’t know Venom had a dog!!! 🖤🖤🖤
*This old boy thinks we adopted the new kitten just for him."*

(He's not wrong).
Ok are you done taking the picture? Can I eat it now?
Best Friends
Meanwhile my dog is terrified of our psycho kitten.
Those are the eyes of a dog that has lived!!
If this dog is not names Spawn...yall missed a great opportunity.
I thought cuddling lions was the cutest thing I'd see today...I was wrong!
Dog: wheres *your* kitten dave?
Well, we actually did.
WHYYYY AYEEEE OUGHTA
Kitten thinks so too. You need to pay the daily reddit tax now
Our beagle curls up on the bed with at least two of our cats each evening. When it’s our bedtime  we get three sets of eyes daring us to disturb them.
The Kitten agrees I think...
Look at that sweet, gray face. 🥺 Senior dogs are the best.
The kitten appears to concur.❤
He’s not wrong.
You must have. Dogs are never wrong.
Omg 😭 what a sweet boy! He deserves a kitten just for himself
Dog has pet now. Pet will become master later.
Such a good soul behind those eyes!
The dog reminds me of Spawn
I know this is totally unrelated, but my wife and I have been looking for a couch/loveseat like yours. Do you remember where you purchased? 

Any help would be appreciated!
/r/KittyPupperLove
Awwwwww
His 🐈‍⬛ now
That’s a pretty ancient pepper❤️.
Are you implying that you _didn't_ get your dog a cat? Because it's his cat now... although he might occasionally need your help with things like cleaning the litterbox and such.
“Come here so I can grab you!”

“No thanks, youngster. I’m good up here.”
Beautiful doggo.
God this is so pure
Look at that sweet frosted face! I love when dogs (or any animal, really) starts turning gray. I look at my senior Boxer girl and it just reminds me that we’ve been so lucky to have her for so many years. Here’s to many more years ahead!💜🥰
When your pet has a pet
How sweet!
He is a good boy.
He looks like a CATahoula!
It’s deffo his kitten.
*waiting for schnoodle*
Aww he’s so happy
Omg, so precious!!! :D
I love him
Face like that? Be honest... you did
Awww, Please give both some scritches from me 😍
And that kitten is just so happy that you got him a dog.
Ya it’s just for next months dinner
Oh my god. Both are so cute. I love them both.
OP, how old is he! Also SUPER CUTE
That’s his now.
Love love love.   What a good brother he shall be.
Regardless, that *is* his kitten now.
Old dogs make me both ecstatic and amazingly sad at the same time.
What a gentle old man
OMG, thank you! I needed to see something super-cute today.
I think so too!
Those sweet beans.
Awwww those eyes tho!! He looks like the sweetest gentlest “baby” boi ever, I love him!!!
Your couch and chair meeting in the background is freaking me out
Is... Is mine?
That’s the same look my dog gives me when he’s waiting for permission to eat dinner.
It looks like you did…..
but didn't you get it just for him?
Look at my post history, I did the same thing! A couple years after grandpa Sid passed, cat adopted a senior pyrenees
What a good boy his so gentle with his kitten sibling.
Meanwhile the cats like “why did you stop fighting me?”
Hey OP...Give Us Names 🐾🐾🐾
My old man looks very similar to yours!!
So cute
well, you did, didn't you? that's clearly his kitten...
This cat well I’m new in town and so excited to meet all your new people I just can’t wait to get to know everybody.

This dog shut up your mind
Handsome old guy
Awwwww 😍
So I was going to say something about the whole "so this is why pitbulls are nanny dogs" thing, but I Googled it and found an article from pitbull lovers saying they *aren't* actually nanny dogs, despite being some of the sweetest and most gentle animals I've ever seen.   


Still, good dog, good kitty, 10/10 both.
MY HEART!!!
Is that why he's licking his lips
I refused to believe you got the kitten anything but for him. He looks too happy to believe anything differently!
dogs and cats are always best of friends....sometimes
Looks like my childhood dog! She was a pit-lab mix and just the best ever; lived to 14 or so!
Didn’t you?? look how happy he is!!
Lovely🥰
You mean, you DIDN’T?!!? They are both absolutely solid cute!
You can tell the audio would have been annoying to hear
The resemblance IS striking
That is so cute what a lucky cat
Oh my sweet goddess, my heart is melting over your precious dog. Please smother him in kisses for me!!
You have some beautiful babies
I just adore your doggo.. such a sweet good boi.. fuck, I love dogs. He looks so dang happy!!! 🤗🤗🤗
Such a loving old man 😍😍😍
But, but.... didn't you adopt the kitten for him? You did, RIGHT!?
I so gray
Sugar Face deserved himself that kitty. They both are adorable!
Happy face and lots of hugs from his baby kitten! 🥰
Awww such a cutie pie
My heart it can only handle so much
Shit, that's why I adopted my 2nd cat so my old kitty can have a young cat to be around, it livened him up for the last few years. It was great for him.
“you got me a kitten? oh you shouldn’t have. NO TOUCH HIM HES MINE”
edit: i just realized that given the fact that the kitty is calico, it is probably a girl. my mistake. BUT calico boys do exist
Adorable
Very cute
What a good boy!
Awwwwww. This is absolutely adorablrness.
my heart cannot take this love and cuteness overload
That dog is actually showing signs of stress. Panting and staring at you. Not a big deal, but I don’t think that dog is happy not eating that cat, but they want to make you happy :)
I don't think I've ever seen a kitten with legs as long as that before!
Mmmh lunch is served
Let him believe what he wants to believe.
Awww Rest In Peace Paco. He reminds me of my old boi who passed at 12 last august :/ 

He was the bestest buds. Grew up with a toy poodle as alpha 🙃
I swear if this dog's name isn't Spawn I'm going to be pissed.
OMG they're both adorable!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Look how happy he is!
Smooches and lots of hugs to these two! 😘😘😘
He's soooooo handsome 😍😍😍
Of course you did!
You mean to say you didn't.... shame on you, every good old boy deserves his very own kitten
This is what love looks like,
"This mine.  I like it.  Thank you."
Dog: Thanks for the snack, I'll eat it later tho. 

Hehe, kidding. This reminds me of my sister's pit who reacted to both a stray kitten we brought in out of the rain and her newborn baby as if they were puppies with lots of licking and an absurd level of tolerance and carefulness for such a strong and hyper dog.
Awesome
Hi new fren!
He’s such a good boy!  Give him major hugs
Look at these two! They are going to be best friends!!
Well you did now!
We want more posts!!!
They’ll be best friends for life
Cute
Well because you did!
Did you NOT?!?
Grampa's LOVE-BUG !!!!!!!!!!
Oh my goodness!!
Most of the dogs I've had loved my cats.

Wow! I have a flair here?
So beautiful!!! I would love so much to get a cat to keep my old dog company, but I just cannot in my living situation... and time flies. Sigh.
Repost with sound, asking for my dogo.
Oh it likes like my new adopted kitten.  https://imgur.com/a/tlIOMXh
You didn’t ?
He’s such a handsome ole boy!
I really hope thats not a huge tick on his head
Thank you.  I really needed that today!
Licking his lips, ready for dinner
He's getting so old, hes turning into venom.
Omg I love old dogs. When can I come over to cuddle?
Cat agrees
So beautiful.  So handsome.  What a sweet love 💞
This is the physical embodiment of r/OldManDog
I definitely woulda named him either Bane or Venom
Such a goodboy!!!
The goodest boy ever.
That is so cute
This is the best thing I’ve seen all day
Cutest damn thing on Reddit today. Thanks op!
"But iz mine 🥺"
Kitten's like "are we doing this or what, old man?"
That’s because you did
What type of dog? My adolescent dog looks exactly like this, only brown.
That dog is a little stressed about that kitten being there. I get it though, kittens are scary.
He's such a handsome guy. Those eyes are so cool.
Awwww🥺🥺💗
They are BFF's!
Well, geez, who else would you have gotten the kitten for if not him?
For me? Thanks for the dinner
SOMEONE LEFT A BABY
You did now
Dog be like: Yay I always wanted a pet! Thanks parents.
A new squeaky toy!

And she clearly loves him back!
Adorable!!  I think kitty agrees!! ❤️❤️

You didn’t adopt the kitty for your doggie, clearly you are confused. The dog is correct 🐶❤️

Oh my god I can’t handle this my heart
This, this does bring a smile to my face
That's his baby now!
That's his baby now!
You did.
You may have just given a few more years to that sweet old man
What a bud!
Nobody tell him
“For me? Thank you!”
Beautiful
He looks so happy!
He didn’t even know he needed someone to love until…❤️❤️❤️❤️
He deserves a companion for all those years of being a good boy.
Holy shit. This is the first video that ever made me audibly go awww
Good buddies! Love it!
You *did* adopt the kitty for him, only you don't seem to know it.
♥️
That’s so sweet.  Makes me smile.
That’s just adorable ..the kitten will help keep him young and on his toes ..that tail wag melts my heart
I swear I can smell that dog from here, and thats not a bad thing.
Didn’t you?
But you did OP
So sweet!!
You didn't?
I mean, you did, didn't you?
The dog kind of looks like Venom.
Omg!  How cute is that. They both love each other. They are so happy.  Congratulations 🎉
Ahh... my daily dose of happy
Wait you didn't get the cat just for him?
"Stop looking at my kitteh, hooman!"
That’s beautiful!
Didn’t you?????
And… you didn’t?
Or did you get an older dog for a new kitten?
Are you sure it's mine , would it be out of place to ask for a DNA test ?
Well that’s because you did!
He’s so pleased with his new pet.
they look so good together.
Aww but didn't you
He has a lot of wisdom to share
You didn’t?
How old is that sweet boy?
Poor pups losing his sight
As he should. Never tell him different.
What a beautiful and distinguished gentleman
So sweet,  great video of this gentle old dude n his new lil friend.
"can I eat it?"
He’s starting to go blind a little bit, at lest he looks like he is.
Kitty!!!! ❤️
This warms my heart
He is sooo happy 😊
How cute!
Is he wrong?
You did.  You just don’t know it yet.
Because you did and you’re not going to tell him otherwise!!/s
They should have their own YouTube show.
You didn’t?
He’s right!
Look at them, there so happy (人 •͈ᴗ•͈)
#CORRECT!
He’s such a happy content camper right now
I love them
The kitten thinks you did too!
He's an angel
The dog is thinking "when my pets bring me a new pet. I love them so much"
This is precious beyond words.
Just a little friend he needs to keep him active ❤️
oh I love how his dear old tail is wagging away and he's smiling so happily!  What a good boy!
Omg 😍
What a sweet angel pup
Reverse panda and a kitten
Oh my god what a sweetheart!
seems like the dog just mostly loves you, cameraperson.
That is an excellent dog.
Omg I love him 😍
How sweet!! You can always tell a pet that's been loved 
( A lot) over the years!! That sweet face! ❤
Didn’t you, though? Beautiful ghost face.
I really needed this after today. Thank you.
“She’s for me? Yeah. She’s mineses!!!”
Does the dog hold the kitten like this often? I've seen this kind of thing before end in a beautiful friendship and often an odd burst of youth for the aging animal. 

He seems very happy to be around the kitten. What a great dog
Um, that’s because you did
The kitten is probably the best thing for your boy 💜
Aww he’s so old. Grandpa dog right there.
The look of pure love on doggos face 💕😭
That is his daughter. She is slightly wonky pup, but perfect all the same.
That's a cute dog.
Awwww
This looks so much like my old dog that it’s actually scary. Did you get him from a rescue in Maryland?
Beautiful old doggo and sweet little pusser/  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|snoo)
Here, chew on this for a while.
>This old boy thinks we adopted the new kitten just for him

Oh stoppit, we know you did.
The talking dog git the kitten
Cats and dogs being friends never gets old!
Then you did !
Best friends 😻 🐶
thats because you did
Awwwwwww
Such a good boi! Pet him for me will ya??
He’s so handsome and I love how sweet he is with his little kitty buddy
I'm sorry, did you NOT adopt the kitten just for him?  For shame!

(Oh my gosh, so cute!)
Dog isn’t wrong
I think she thinks so too!
This just destroyed me. I had a really old black lab. I miss her so much. 😣 

What a beautiful senior man!
when we got a german shepherd my cat wanted to beat its ass.
Reminds me of Spawn lol
Cats all: Do you mind?
I need more of this
You did…didn’t you?
Is he wrong?
This is so my dog also. Makes my heart so happy
Kitten: Damn right I am his.
awwwww 😭😭😭
Your pet now has his own petpet!
I'm going to hug him and kiss him and call him George!
Handsome boy. And yes, that kitten was brought home just for him.
That boy looks honestly pretty nervous about the whole thing. Probably nothing he won't manage or get over on his own, but something to keep an eye on. Hope he quickly gets used to having a kitten around!
I really hope you named your dog Clooney
He's so sweet and patient, I love how after he dodges those paws a few tunes that kitten finally goes limp.
Don't tell him any different!  
You were already great but now he thinks your the GRRRRReatest!  
(Sorry, I couldn't resist.)  
They're adorable together!
I need to hear the sounds of appreciation from this reverse raccoon!!
So cute together!
Boxer mix? He looks like my boy just different color
But you did adopt the kitten for him…right?
They look alike.
spawn's dog
:the dog anew chew toy just for me
awe... good ol boy.
ROFL! And calico kitty is enjoying the attention 🥰
Best buds
You did!
The dog looks like he's the best boy
Well you did! Didn’t you? Ask the good boy for me! I’ll wait!
I love them both!
good boii
For me? Golly
You didnt?
the kitten’s lil reaching paws 🥺🥺😫😫
Sweet dogs..
Cute Fight
Aww, he needs a kitten to take care of.
You did.
And you know he's right. You did get kitty for him.
And you mean to tell me you didn't?
“But actually we are preparing for him to drop dead
I knew the comments would make me happy
The kitten trying to snuggle his face sure helps that assumption
You turned my frown upside-down. Thank you 💖
I did adopt a kitten for my dog. They get along so well even though the 7 month old kitten is now the same size as my 5 year old dog! Lol Okay, the kitten isn't just for my dog! Lol
His kitten now
This looks so wholesome
That is absolutely adorable. He does think the kitten is his new pet and he is so happy!!! 😻🐶
It’s not?!?
This is the best dinner I every had, thanks dad.
Doesn't realize that the cat is his substitute after he well u know
Awww happy doggo
Super cute.
Whether you think you did or not, it's of no consequence.   You did get kitty for him.  He's not gonna compromise on that love.  


Nor will you, I suspect.   We'll done!

ETA  kitty has chosen as well.  You are sol on who has this cat.
Lucky kitten to have such a sweet old boy as his own
I LOVE dogs who love cats. My golden retriever is obsessed with cats.
Dog looks like he’s wearing a super hero mask 🦸‍♂️.

Edit: SPAWN
That is so cute. ♥️ 🐾
He’s so happy!!! 😄
Omg, I'm dying
If I had a doggo that looked like that, I’d name them Venom!


They’re both so cute 😍!!
How long have they been together? Kitty is acting pretty secure and is really affectionate toward the dog. Very sweet dog. Thanks for sharing.
They’ve adopted each other.
Yeah it just for him 🤣☺️
So wholesome man , so wholesome
It's 11am here and I recently woke up and this is the best way to start the day. By far.
Didn’t you? If not, why not?
Well I want to cuddle them both.
We are venom
Please tell me the dogs name is Venom
