When my partner fell down stairs and broke her leg, our dog came to sit on her and protect her.

... I mean, it wasn't exactly helpful, but it was rather sweet.I'd like to think my dogs would act like this but I have Huskies, and they would just as likely bugger off for an adventure.Oh my gosh this video. That sweet dog not wanting to bite, and then the dude reaching out to comfort his doggie, just so much sweetness in such a short clip. 



*Edit:Holy cow my first gold! Thank you kind stranger! Happy New Year everyone!!As an EMT I have a hard time not petting people's dogs even though I know I am the most likely person they'll bite. 

I've met some really awesome dogs at work though so it's worth it. As long as I have enough fingers left to put on ekg leads/drive for my medic. "I am going with him. Or else.":( what a good pup. Hope the owner was okGood dog didn't actually want to bite either, it was just pretending. My dog would be like ‚ÄúLoads of new people here **and** my owner is on a stretcher and can‚Äôt stop me meeting them?? Best day *ever*!The guy reaching out to comfort his doggo at the end got me.anyone know the story behind it? Where was this, what had happened to the owner etc?Loyalty I should get a dogGood doggo?
No. 
The best doggo. This hits home on a personal level. I have the bestest baby girl that I adopted a few years ago. Several months ago my landlord came over to fix something. I passed out when I opened the door for him, then passed out again when I got up to get water, prompting him to call an ambulance. The entire time I was on the floor waiting for paramedics, then waiting as they took my vitals and got more information, she was at my side with her front paws on top of me and wouldn‚Äôt move. The paramedics were awesome and just worked around her. She came to the emergency room with me on the stretcher. I ended up in the hospital for three days and couldn‚Äôt get out of bed on my own because I was a fall risk. She stayed in that hospital bed with me the whole time I was there except for when I asked the nurses to take her outside to relieve herself. Shoutout to all of you in the medical/emergency services profession who are so understanding of the bond between dog and owner in situations like this. 

Edit: here‚Äôs a pic from the emergency room for anyone interested https://imgur.com/gallery/PbozdXO Dogs rock[deleted]The fact that man is risking pain to comfort his dog shows there bond is strong. My heart can't handle this :( hope the guy is alright and they're reunited and safe at home...as a former street medic, I can assure you I would be talking to the doggo like, you're a good boy and you can come with us, but we gotta help him, too...yes, you're a good boy, yes you are...

I don't know how we'd transport him and keep track of him at the hospital, maybe bring a neighbor along for kicks or something. But, hey, the dog goes in my book. I‚Äôm pretty sure my dog loves me, but he would have definitely got distracted by a butterfly, or rock, or something. i am the dog n this my man -

i doing every thing i can

to keep him safe - i will PROTEC!

you hurt my friend - i'll give you Heck

there's something wrong, he can't get up

is Now he needs his hero pup!

i'll put my whole life on the line

until i know that he is fine

no other bond is greater than

the one between a dog and manA K9 officer in my hometown was killed by a drunk driver. The dog survived the crash and fought with the first responders. They had to call the officers wife to the scene to calm the dog down. Pretty shitty situation for everyone. The dog ended up living for a few more years and is now buried beside the officer. I needed that today. When my dog fell a few years ago and broke her back we had to put her down.

She was lucid the entire trip to the vet and despite the fact that she was absolutely broken she just kept licking me because I was crying. All the way up until the end she licked me and tried to cheer me up.The tears. Dogs are the best loyal pals [no matter what the situation.](https://i.imgur.com/ZpEVkbd.gifv)If that was me, my dog would probably just start chasing a squirrel or somethingHis tail is so deep in between his legs when he gets to his owner! He was so scared but wouldn‚Äôt leave his side üò≠ We really don‚Äôt deserve doggosWow this is such a beautiful thing to see. Dog's can be such pure and amazing creatures. Too bad humans have to make everything so complicated.Wow someone's really got nerve, cutting onions in my own houseA similar thing happened to my mum when she was in a bad car accident.

She was driving along a country highway when another car pulled into her lane headed towards her, causing her to swerve to avoid the car, rolling multiple times and coming to a rest on its roof. My mother had been driving with her dog beside her, and he jumped into her arms as the car rolled. Amazingly they both survived (the rescue crew said they had never seen an animal survive a crash like that) and the good boy stayed with mum for the 2 hours it took rescue crews to get to the site, all the while licking her face.

The good boy only ran away when the rescue team fired up the equipment to cut the doors off, and then he stayed in the ambulance while mum was flown to hospital. He survived for 2 years after that crash and never left mums side the entire time. üôÅfeelings......aww poor puppy is scared for his dad!The bond between a dog and it's owner is the most precious thing ever :(My dog would do this. I'm her fucking muse, got her from the shelter, since the first day she will not leave my side. She wouldn't look at me in the shelter until we got in the car and I could tell it clicked that I was her new owner. No man will ever love me as much as that dog loves me and that's just fine because I will never love any man like love her.I love this dog. Something nice from Brazil!!In reality, as cute as this is, keep your dogs on the leash. If your dog stops the paramedics from giving you necessary care, that‚Äôs a problem. A leash helps get your dog under control so you can be taken care of. More like /r/Baww .. :(And now I'm crying at work.A dogs love is unconditional.Relieved to see the owner move his handüôåWhat did we do to have such a wonderful species as our friends?‚ÄúYOURE DOIN ME A HECKIN CONCERN, FREN!‚ÄùHad a issue like this one time. Small service dog, had the owner cradle the dog between arm and body, spider strapped them in. No issues, dog felt secure, and owner like the comfort of the dog next to them. It was a minor wreck. but this is something to keep in mind as more people travel with "support" animals. Oh my gosh when I saw this I actually said awww out loud.  Just got home after being gone for 3 days. I have a 4 legged shadow. Best type of shadow.r/gifsthatendtoosoon tenner bets he cuddles the dogs assDamn. There's a million movie scenes exactly like this but this is better than every one of them./u/fineship I'm cryingThis deserves a lot of gold. Love it.oh this is a very faithful dog[deleted]And this is why you have collars on animals...But gonna lie, almost cried. the dog will be such good karma that he will straightup become a human in his life. Such an admirable loyalty! such an admirable love! the gods have blessed him.Life goals.Is it sad I‚Äôm tearing up over that?My dog is like this and I am so scared one day it will get her in trouble. Any tips on how I make her less worried about my safety/protection. Wish she would chill out and have a good time more. She has had a rough life before I picked her up at about 1 year old. She is 2 now. Wow that‚Äôs another great one! I love these types of clips, dogs are so loyal and caring. I love them all üòÄ‚ò∫Ô∏èUnconditional loveDad...Dad its going to be ok I'm here I'm here

Right then outta my way medics I got this shit ... wait am I doing 30 and 2 or just paws only CPR ?Someone, please put a collar on that poor pup. My dog sucks as a guard dog and doesn‚Äôt really learn tricks. One  thing is for sure, it protect me  100%I fully expect heaven is populated by my two grandmothers and a shit ton of dogs.I'm not crying you areWe don‚Äôt deserve dogsGood Boy!!!You see the dogs tail tucked away when he reached him, meaning even though he was scared himself,he would still face the attackers*
Dogs are simply the bestestA loyal dog.We don't deserve dogsWow I didn't know I could cry this much. Thanks! I have two dogs, one is a lab retriever and other one is huskey. I am pretty damn sure that my lab retriever will never let me go in this or any situation but my huskey lol he is just interested in food at a crazy level thats all. I can imagine him coming to me in this situation (only because my lab retriever is already there hugging me thinking i am giving away food)  and ask " well give me food before you take off will ya" lol üòÇüòé  My huskey is crazy...i bet the guy got hurt chasing after the dog.Yeah, that is my dog. Good gif. Good dog.If this happens to my cat, she will freak out by the presence of so many strangers and run the opposite direction. Never to be found again...Mans best friend!so cuteI‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying. This is what unconditional love looks like.We dont deserve dogsI love itWe don't preserve logs.[deleted]The EMS worker throws his hands out like ‚Äúwtf let us do our job‚Äù but imma pretend he threw them out because the dog didn‚Äôt go to him.Thats a good doggo. Break free, check the pulse, protect.A firefighter had an issue when he went to save someone from a crashed car. The poor dog believed they were trying to hurt its owner and held them off before animal services.Dogs mean well. But most of the time their stupidity just gets in the way. Hahahahahaha the dog is so loyal it's preventing medical care because it's a moron oooh I want a dog!Upvote for not saying "furbaby" and "furdaddy."[deleted]I love how he wasn‚Äôt really bitting him. Just giving him warning bites. Then when he just runs and lays on his owner... ohh the feels. I love animals Gentlemen of the jury: The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog. Gentlemen of the jury: A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.

If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.

I hope that guy is OK, for his and his beautiful pup's sake.This is beautiful!Loyal to the soil That loyalty is something we will never be able to offer someoneWhat a good boy.Instantly cryingThanks now I'm crying.
