Living the dream
That's mad. A few hours ago I saw a sheep lying down and munching, like this. This video is the second time I've ever seen it. I'm 40 and live in Ireland, so I've seen a lot of sheep.
Breakfast in bed
Life is so great, lying here eating grass. I don‚Äôt understand why everyone says 2020 has been such a baaAAaaaAaAadd year.
I imagine animals all around the world are chilling now that we‚Äôre all indoors
It's nice to see someone else living out your dream
Actually looks like it's chewing its cud, not the grass, but still .
This one. *This* is my spirit animal.
I once had a very lazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy cat who would do this with her dry food if I left it on paper plate. Lost her 7 years and still miss her.
Pandemic mood.
it's probably not eating that grass it's probably chewing cud
I guess if you live in vegan farm, life could be pretty good for a sheep.
[deleted]
I‚Äôve been working from home since the pandemic hit. My pup usually goes to day care but now that I‚Äôm home I haven‚Äôt had to take her. I have been letting her out in the backyard to get some sun and bird watch.

One day I looked out the window and saw her laying on her side in the middle of the yard, which was very unusual. I called her name several times and she didn‚Äôt respond. I started thinking the worst. I sprinted outside in a panic. 

As soon as I got to her I could see she was fully awake, laying on her side, just chewing on some grass, completely content. Little sh*t almost gave me a heart attack lol
That's my spirit animal
This is a god-damned mood right here.
I've worked on several Icelandic farms. My bosses told me Icelandic sheep often overeat and thus become too fat to get up from the ground. As they're out in the wide fields all summer and aren't regularly checked by the owners, those overeater sheep die while probably nibbling even more grass like this one. Sorry to destroy a bit of the romance here!
Me at 2 am eating cheetos:
Replace the grass with pizza and I'm there!
Why does it have the happy anime eyes
Just buy a fur suit and join the sheep
Typical teenager
That sheep could be sick. I would check before upvoting.
Seen a couple of sheep like this, unfortunately it was not a happy story. They were sick from tetanus after an attack by stray dogs
This is also what the last month of pregnancy looks like.
you don't know, that sheep could be dying..

wow I kinda wish I was that sheep right now
This is a genius sheep. He realized that the grass is on ground so why is he standing up to eat something that's on the ground.
That sheep is a genius! If he ever gets into a can of Redbull or Monster he may take over the world for a few hours!
Idk im sure I look like this when I'm eating a breakfast burrito in bed.
This right here is the dream.
Oh to be a sheep laying in the sunshine nibbling on grass
That would be me eating on a couch....if I had one.  I am putting this down as a must accomplish this year.
I understand this sheep.
God I wish that was me
Now that‚Äôs the life
live laugh love
Probably got slaughtered or sheered after this though.
sorry to be that guy, but this is likely a very ill animal.
Literally me :)
Wow he should get out back up after this cuz I think it‚Äôs sheep that can‚Äôt get up if they fall on there side on was it there back
He lays me down in green pastures and brings me beside still waters
Don't want to die or need to die, ect ect I hope people are actually starting to piece together that these animals are being slaughtered needlessly for our appetit. It's 2020 not the stone age.
My naem is shep

I full of wull

I nom on grass

To keep me full

Dont wanna stand

And so I lays

And chomp on grass

For rest of days

I basicaly already do this, although instead of grass its frozen pizza, and instead of a hill its a poorly lit room.
If it eats too much, it might not be able to get back up.
This is what my heaven will be

We had a dog that would do this. One year I tried growing herbs in a container so she would plop down next to that and just decimate all that was edible. I really loved that dog.
He was nibbling strong grass before this grass
That‚Äôs one lazy-arsed sheep. Respect.....
Maximum net calorie intake.
Such a hard life being a sheep XD
I always thought the concept of ‚Äúspirit animal‚Äù was so dumb. 

This is my spirit animal
Stoned sheep
It not only doesn‚Äôt know so much about what makes its life possible, it also just doesn‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs grass-munching time.
Looks like ruminating, to me....
This is my baby when she wakes up.
Sometimes all we need are those happy moments to enjoy life :)
R/casualuk
A whole mood
I wonder if grazing animals ever get sick of how much time they need to spend eating just to survive? Cows for example need 90lbs of food a day on average, that means they spend about 6 hours a day eating, and 8 hours a day chewing their cud. Imagine if humans had to be chewing on food 14 hours a day just to survive lol
Current mood
If a sheep can nibble on grass a human can nibble on leaves
Me_irl
This is my old Bassett Hound in the summertime. She loves to flop onto the grass until she‚Äôs boiling hot and insists on trying to eat grass (she‚Äôs not sick and isn‚Äôt lacking vitamins just an obsessive idiot.)
Must be great to be aware that food is literally everywhere for that particular sheep.
Imagine sleeping in a bed made of donuts and munching donuts while you sleep
üêë says "This is life!"
If this isn‚Äôt a life goal I don‚Äôt know what is!
Dude when a sheep has fallen down it can‚Äôt get itself up again and actually needs help doing so.
He!, Oscar

That is laziness at its best.  I could see my dog doing this.
This is so calming
Thats life
Hey, that‚Äôs me. Stop being a pervert and filming me
Sheeps are like your stupid friend. They know how to enjoy life and have fun, thats it.

that fat sheep might be a momma in labor
Actually it might need to be picked up, sheep sometimes lay down but can't get back up and they'll just die. My friend had sheep and one was just chillin but he didn't pick it up and it died next to the water bucket. Something to remember is what my grandpa always said about sheep "the only thing dumber than a sheep is the one who owns them"
This is how I'd like to spend the rest of 2020

My dream is to own a ranch with a bunch of rescue animals. Dogs, cats, cows, goats, chickens, piggies, etc.. And spend my days tending to them and chillin with all the animal homies.
It might just be dreaming. My dog moves her mouth like that a lot when she's dreaming.
Is that a Texelaar!
This. Now this is how stoned I wish I was.
What if the sheep is sick or injured and that's the only way it can eat? It's probably just being lazy but in nature animals usually only do that if there is an abnormal behaviour going on. Though humans tend to anthropomorphize and misinterpret animals actual behaviours.

My spirit animal right there
I wonder, did it just say "nope" and plop over to eat or is it depressed and this is the sheep version of eating in bed?  Questions are raised.  Will it roll over when it needs a new place to nibble?  Are the other sheep mocking it?  Maybe it only has those two legs?  This will plague me for at least 10 mins.  Maybe less.
I used to have an overweight cat that used to eat that way, I'd always pick him up and make him crouch, it was cute though

And get killed. U can eat grass anytime..

At least this sheep is not being tortured and crying in the slaughterhouse right now
It appears he had a bit to much weed
It probably ate some liberty caps
If I were a sheep
But then also being shaved off every week, so that hoomans can stay warm. Or worse be slaughtered so hoomans can have a freakin ritual.
What happened? A cow is lazily nibbling , a sheep is lazily nibbling .. I see they've caught my laziness disease.
I did the same thing once, but shrooms were involved.
Emmm, shepherd's pie
enjoying to live in dream world
Aw bob if you ever leave me I know where to look!
Hope he is lazy, and not disabled
If only most sheep got this luxury instead of being factory farmed üòî
My dog does this sometimes.
Since sheep/cows/etc are pretty much surrounded by an essentially limitless supply of food, how come they don't get to be massively obese?

I feel like if grass was like my favorite thing to eat and I could digest it properly I'd probably weigh 1000 lbs
wow, i hope i'm not too late for this comment to be seen... PSA: if you see this, you have the opportunity to save a sheep's life. Sheep do not lay down on their backs to scratch or "lazily nibble grass on a hill". They have a very hard time standing up from this position. This a particular problem for pregnant sheep. If you see a sheep like this, helping it up could mean preventing it from dying where it lies.... I know this is kind of hard to believe, but if you care, learn more & share the word. Here's some more info: https://youtu.be/B0iJQD7B6DQ
That‚Äôs literally me.
What do sheep count to go to sleep blades of grass?
Currently in staycation. If I look in a mirror, this is exactly what I would see.
Sums up a lot of people in quarantine.
You are joking right?. Constant eating 18 -20 hours a day.walking to find more grass. Chewing and regurgitating and rechewing. If you are lucky you are born female and will have several years life giving birth to twins every year. Shorn of hair once per year.
Oh and there's so little money in sheep farming you will never see the vet so no healthcare except what the farmer can do.
And if you are male. Probably got one summer of life before becoming spring lamb.
Mooi. Ik houdt van Texel
It‚Äôs not lazy it‚Äôs dying.
It good to see animals not being stressed and fighting eachother in a factory farm :) The meat of a chilled out animal is better than a streesed one's

they aren't grazing, they are chewing their cud. having so many stomachs they regurgitate into their mouth and rechew before it goes into another stomach.
Then being killed for food
few thoughts...

you don't know what that sheep is going through. it may be laying down because it just witnessed its family member/friend forcibly manhandled and shorn of its fur, or worse, butchered. what we're witnessing is this sheep giving in to the inevitability of its demise.

another is, given geographical constraints, there may be nothing preventing you from laying in a field somewhere and nibbling on grass. matter of fact, do this and send us a follow up picture...

That's not a hill it's a Deich.
I gulped down 2 large glasses of tonic water with Quinine. Yikes. I was really woozy. Scary. The pangolins have their vaccines for maleria and coronavirus. Where is ours? Perhaps I was just sleepy but it makes me nervous. I had this once before but no fever. The quinine seemed to work. I feel more alert. Must remember to drink my quinine daily.
Hey that‚Äôs my boy pedro
Sleeping sickness? Need to get more tonic water with Quinine. Malaria and Corona are the same family of sickness. It would be bad to drift off and not wake up. Reddit keeping me alive. Have not had my vaccine yet.
My Dad thought I had malaria because I was so sleepy as a teen. He got me tested even. I always took my quinine when we went to the coast though.
