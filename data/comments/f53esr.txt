I've gotten a few PMs asking questions about him so here you go:

This is Atka and he's 11 years old. I think he's a Malamute Corgi mix, but honestly have no clue. He's on a diet, 3 walks a day, and gets lots of wrestle time and pets. His health is improving rapidly with exercise, diet, and love. He's incredibly friendly and has done well in every situation we've put him in. Also, everything I own is white now.
Thank you for adopting a senior, the video made my night!
Bless you for loving a senior. Hes living his best yrs out
Now you can sleep with your leg hanging out the bed, because the good boi is making sure there are no monsters under your bed!
I adopted an overweight senior beagle who did the same thing. I built him a mini house out of a cage and just removed the door, put a blanket over it and added a big fluffy bed.
SO CUTE!!!! lil groundhog boy
Senior huskies are best huskies. (Mals?)
Senior dogs are hands down the best dogs. Especially big ones. They are super chill, have great and quirky personalities and are so loving.  And you dont really have to train them. I wish more people would adopt senior dogs. What a beautiful boy you got 😊 give him extra pets from me
Oh he's so cute
My dudes, first off bless you for taking in a senior doggo. I’m not religious but couldn’t think of a better way of saying I think you’ve done a wonderful thing and you deserve so much credit for that. 

For a few years I was immersed in the animal welfare community because my ex was immersed in the animal welfare community, it’s pretty much a lifestyle for both partners in a relationship. We fostered so many animals, mostly dogs, and the best experience I personally had was with senior dogs. 

Senior dogs unfortunately are the last to get adopted from shelters because most people coming in to adopt are looking for a “family pet” that will grow with their family, a lot of times along side their little ones. So the thought of having a dog for just a couple of years is not desirable, which I don’t blame people for. It’s not easy to lose a family pet, so the longer you can push that off the better. But senior dogs are the best kind of dogs because the majority of the time, if they’ve made it that far, and made it through the inspection process where it’s determined they can be readopted, then they are already family dogs. 

In San Diego, a big military town, lots of military family get dogs and make them part of their family. But sometimes, the family gets orders for another base that is either out of country or in-country where they don’t believe they can have a dog. These family dogs are then abandoned at the shelter. It’s pretty sad. It’s actually heart breaking when you realize that a lot of times, these dogs are waiting for their owners to come back. I’ve fostered several dogs for months at a time who were so happy to be out of the shelter (and therefore protected from euthanasia) and even though they were happy, they were always on the lookout. My impression/ opinion was that they were always hoping their family would come back. 

Anyway, that’s sad. For many of those pups we kept them until they finally passed. We knew they deserved to live the rest of their days in a home. My ex was better than me about not getting emotionally attached. But I couldn’t help it. I love dogs and I loved them all. I’m happy to know that they got that comfort again. I see your pup having that same comfort. So thank you for adopting a senior pup. They truly deserve to feel that love again.
his sweet face!
What a sweet pup! ❤️
You ever watch a video of someone and their pet and the way they talk to them seams wrong?

Like they psspsspss wrong or don't use the same tone as you?

Not with this guy. He and I speak to our dogs the exact same way.
That is the cutest and happiest dog I have ever seen in my life
Thank goodness I am laying down because that smile makes my knees weak. 🥺
Aww his little den! My german shepherd always goes under my bed but he never sleeps there. Your doggo looks so loving!
Oh my goodness he looks so happy!
Thank you for adopting a senior dog! You two are gonna give each other such a wonderful life.
I'm going use that voice when I'm passing you on the racetrack this race season.   You know it's true because I just bought the gopro mic 🤣
What a good boy!
He’s never too big/old to keep monsters out from under his bed
[deleted]
Seniors are the BEST! I’ve adopted two so far, and I’m hooked. They have so much love to give. We only had our second one for two years before she passed, but they were two of the best years of my life. Thank you for giving this sweet baby the chance he deserved!!
I love him
What a happy looking boy.
omg sooo cuteeeee
Awwwww he’s the cutest thing !!
How is it so clean under your bed?
Pleasant monster under the bed
I'll give you 2 options, either give me the dog peacefully or you can suffer the consequence
Old dogs=best dogs
My Yorkie Pancake made it to 16 and his brother (not by canine family, but by human family) we got a couple years later is currently 14. I love my old dogs and when I can do so, I plan to adopt as many old shelter pups as possible. Good to see old companions get love!
God bless you for adopting a senior dog. You are an amazing person!
The best way to start the day
Lay a blanket under the bed, gives him a clean surface to sleep on and you can help him out in the morning by just pulling the sheet out.
look at his happy face! very cute doggo! it's nice to know that there are still good people on this world :)
This is the cutest fucking day of my life
Everyone liked that
Have you thought of perhaps putting the feet of your bed on blocks (but in a way they wont slip off) to give him a couple more inches?
He scoot for the snoot boop 👆
Chonky boi. You could say hes a bit...HUSKY
Oh my goodness... I love him.
Seniors are the best!   I adopted my 11 year old doxie 1 year ago and wouldn't hesitate to adopt another senior in an instant.
He protec you from the monsters under the bed
I wish that is my all the time routine
He seems very happy to belong to a family again! Bless you.
What breed is it?
My heart really hurts  imagining how someone would  abandon their friend just because he got old.
You're an amazing and beautiful human being for adopting a senior. All my blessings to you. He's so adorable!!
You might want to look into that, when an animal stays or sleeps under furniture its often a sign that they don't yet feel safe where they are.
Thank you
Aww! 

Our senior husky did this and it was adorable... until one day she couldn’t get out because arthritis in her knees melts her from crawling. We built her a fort around her dog bed and she loved it just as much. I highly recommend!
This is so pure.
You're a gem of a person.
Video is criminally short ! He is so huggable!
He looks so happy! You guys are awesome for taking this sweet boy in :)
I just want too squish his face while giving all the pets
Bed shark attack
What a sweetheart. Glad he has found his forever home with you
We have a husky who likes to spend her time under the bed in the same mannerism.
What a cutie
Now this is the kind of monster under my bed that I want
You got a bed monster
He might be a little bit frightened as it's a big change, so has found a safe place to chill. I wish you years of wonderful happiness together!!
Please record every moment of this doggos life and post it on the interwebs for us.
I want 10.
What a sweetie pie ❤❤❤
CUte ❤️☺️😍
Omg he is soooo adoreable 😭❤
I'm a simple man I see an alaskian malamute, husky, GS, or anything that look's like them or cute in general and I up-vote.
I misread and thought it said Señior Doggo.
Awwwwwwwwwww he’s so cute 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
The likeness to my old dog Tundra is striking enough I've signed up for an account on Reddit just to post this. Your dog looks so much like my old dog Tundra. How old is he / where are you? I adopted Tundra in Toronto from the Humane Society. Tundra then moved all the way to the UK with me but unfortunately was put down in 2014, he had epilepsy, we kept him going for as long as we could, by our reckoning in 2014 we think he was somewhere around 11/12 years old. He was a cross with something else as well but we could never figure it out. Tundra -> [https://imgur.com/a/MVc0rKF](https://imgur.com/a/MVc0rKF) he's darker but your pic looks like Tundra did when we would trim him. Honestly your doggo looks so much like an old-man Tundra...
Soo cute
Thank you for adopting this doggo during his golden years. It means a lot to you but it’s his world.
Look at his face 😊😊so cute
Awe he’s so cute
😍
He's so sweet!! Give him a smooshie from me!!
(A smooshie is an extra good petting)
He loves you guys!
I haven't checked all the comments but may I suggest bed risers to give him a little more room? I've got a fat one too who likes being under the bed and he's gotta do a little dance to come out.

But thank you for adopting such a good old boy
My husky is always trying to sleep under my bed. There isn't really enough room, so he just half way wedges himself under. 

It gives me a heart attack, worried our bed will break and squish him. And watching him trying to get up quickly when he is half stuck lol

Such a dork
Heh.  Reminds me of when I was living with my aunt while going to college.  The husband of my other aunt on that side died, and since my cousin lived in the o thg her side of the country (and wanted nothing to do with her father, besides) dealing with it fell to my aunt Teresa.  Including my aunt Sherry's old dog, Barnie.  

She could never understand why he loved hanging out in my room,  underneath my bed.   It was a mixture of dogs liking small enclosed spaces like that, me being close enough for him to feel my presence,  and the fact that I left him the hell alone.

If he came over to me,  I'd pet him, otherwise I just let him be.  Didn't try to crowd him or constantly have his attention. 

Of course, this is also the same aunt who a few years earlier was shocked when her mini doberman pinscher, jesse, crawled right onto my lap while my brother and I were visiting.   Jesse had cancer at that point, and didn't like most people to begin with.
He's such a sweetie!!!
If this was my morning routine...I think I'd turn into a morning person
What a sweet boy. Thanks for sharing!
I want it
Awww! Shy boi!

I rescued a disabled cat from craigslist a few years ago... he stayed under my bed for the first few days.... and then one morning, I woke up because I heard/felt him jump up onto the bed with me!!

But... I was on my stomach, and when I pushed up to roll over... I cut a huge, loud fart... and Rudy BOLTED back under the bed and I laughed so hard I thought I would die.


(Epilogue; Rudy forgave me and came out as soon as I knelt down and apologized with some cat treats and we became very good friends !)
He’s so adorable!
I love you for adopting an old man dog and making sure his remaining days are happy and fulfilling ❤❤❤❤
This is so cute! He looks so happy! Just wait until he sleep ON the bed with you lol!

Edit: I’ve watched this way too many times, I cannot get enough of the cuteness!
That smile make my day ! Such a good boy !
That has to be one of the sweetest faces I’ve ever seen
My dog did the same for a while.  He did it so he could pee inside without getting caught
You guys are amazing. God bless you and enjoy your floofy angel
u/nicau22 you deserve to see this happy senior doggo face 💜
I keep reading this as "Señor doggo" and it makes me happy
I just love when old dogs have that pup energy/aura
Ohhh this reminds me so much of my senior baby who just recently passed away. She has the same cute puppy eyes and she loves to wiggle inside small places, and I call out to her when we go out for walkies.

She gave me thirteen lovely years, and I miss her so much. Please enjoy all the time you have with your dog, and take lots of videos. 
You're giving her the best of her golden years.
This is the first post I've ever seen with 100k upvotes, and it deserved every single one of those upvotes.
The good news: you no longer have monsters under the bed.

The also good news: that is the sweetest sentient dust bunny I've ever seen.
My dog has always slept underneath the bed. He absolutely loves it and every morning he plays with me just trying to get him to go outside for his morning piss. I literally hang my head off one side to look under and he runs out the other then when I go to that side to pet him he slides right back under. So I have to go the other side to look under and he goes the opposite way again. It takes about 10 minutes every morning where he just plays tag with me like that. I love my pup.
I think dogs are the only animal that genuinely feels gratitude. Like this guy. "Oh Boy! I got a home and people who love me! "

Good for you for adopting a senior!
He must be tired fighting all those monsters under your bed. Indeed the goodest of boys.
Not to be dramatic but I’d die for hin
so so cute! shout out to you for adopting a senior pup, old boys are good boys too ❤️
Aaah senior dogs are the best. I’m going to go adopt one now! Adopt Don’t Shop :)
Awwwww, he's beautiful!!
Why he so cute and thicc tho?
Good boy keeping the monsters away
Dear Sir/Madam

We regret to inform you that a mistake has been made on our end. We have accidentally given you one of our candidates for "Rescue a bear" program. Please bring back the candidate immediately and we will resolve the issue. In the mean time feel free to visit our website to answer a few short questions on how we did today.

Regards, animal shelter
I know you won't see this in the pool of 1k comments but I just want you to know that I love him. He's so cute and sweet, and I respect you so much for rescuing a senior dog. People don't usually do that. You're giving him an amazing rest of his life. :' )
Yep, my dog likes the tight spaces too. She squeezes under the ottoman and stays there for a long nap before whining to have us help her out. It's one of the more silly things she does.
Thx for adopting a senior
We adopted a 9 year old malamute. Picked him up and discovered he was nearly blind. Then discovered he had to have 15 teeth extracted due to poor feeding practices. His prior owner only fed him salmon. She was older and thankfully she realized she couldn’t care for him anymore. 

He was with us for two years. Two amazing years.

Senior dogs have do much love to give.
If you put a blanket over her cage or made some similar 'hut' over a dog bed, would he sleep there? Nothing wrong with the dog sleeping under the bed, just maybe less difficult for them to get in/out if what they're really after is a cave-like area to live.
He is protecting you from the monsters under you're bed
Senior Dog? More like Elder Pupper
The goodest of bois😍
That smile is just the best
Atka thinks you should get some lifts for your bed to make it easier for him to crawl under...
My mom was angry from morning this vid made her laugh, you made day thank you.
that is the cutest dog I ever saw
Thanks I Love It
Looks like this doggo was brought up crate trained and is adapting.
Thanks for adopting an older pets.
Awe, dangit. This reminds me of an awful experience I had... 

I was someones house, and she was/is my absolute favorite person of all time . . .she had an older dog, and had him for the long haul. 


One night while we were sleeping he crawled under the bed as he always did and begun his seizures among other things; It was one of the most heart jerking things I've seen, telling her that we could take him to the vet, and to be mindful of them trying to sell a golden casket. And of course, they did.. offering surgery's and only mentioning the true positive outcome of the surgery's to be good natured at best upon directly asking them.


..and she got a baby Malumt  to try and fill some pain; owie.
He’s lovely, and you know he’s going to love his forever home
Look at his happy face!  Bless you for taking in a senior dog - you are an evolved soul. 😘
I love it so much. Good on you and good on him for being so very delightful.
“Senior doggo”. I love that
THOSE HECKING PAWS!
What an adorable ball of floof!! My heart just melted watching this ❤️
My heart just melted......
Super cute
Omg, he's so precious! He melts my heart! ❤
Veteran doggo boiye
I geniinely cried
Happy puppers has a den and a pack. What a cutie!
God love this lovely big Chonk
OH LAWD HE COMIN
Cute doggo
I'm thinking you have to make a decision soon, either raise the bed or stop feeding him
That's god damn happy doggo.
Such a precious doggo
OH BOY HE H A P P
Conspiracy: he wasn't allowed to sleep under bed by previous owner and always wanted to. But this is reddit so also: dogs sleeping under beds is terribly dangerous- it puts them at grave risk of carpet fever and bed box disorder!!!
H E C O M E S
He thicc
Our senior doggo will snuggle with us in bed, but when he ready to sleep, nope! F that! Under the bed he goes!

Your good boy is the goodest boy
thank you for blessing my feed and my day, what a sweet doggo
Cute Doggo, perhaps he feels more secure under the bed, older animals develop quirks just like humans do? Nice one, adopting a senior fella.
That my friend, is one adorable floofer. Congrats!
What a cute happy doggo
How sweet!
Same but with my like 4-5 or so year old chihuahua hes chubby but more thicc than chubby and he goes there EVERY. CHANCE. HE. GETS. Idk but he just loves it there and i sometimes love it too
What breed is this?hes hella cute
Omg I almost died of utmost cuteness I want him 😔
He can be very close to you but in he's own place, it's super soft attitude 😭💕
yes.
I need that lovable fluffy giant in my life omfg.
If there's ever an earthquake you'd best believe I would be under there with that dog
Huskies are big into 'dens'.
My dear friend is also a husky and shel loves sleeping under the bed
The senior dog we adopted does the same thing! He’ll go under the bed to sleep but most nights around 2-3am he’ll crawl out, go to the edge of our bed and do a very cute little bark noise until we invite him up with us.
Thank you for posting such a picture of joyful eneygy. Congratulations on your adoption!
Baby!
I have a senior doggy but I've had him for years.  Still I wouldn't mind adopting a senior dog.
A day cannot be bad if it starts like that.
How do you keep its hairs away? Genuinely interested!
Those eyebrows are something!
You sound like The Stradman
Aww what a wonderful fluff ball!
Big chunk of love. He’s adorable, his last years will definitely be the best years of his life<3
[removed]
I have had my Labrador for ten years. He has recently within the last year, found comfort under our coffee table.  I love him dearly.
10 minutes video would be great. What a cute doggo.
Oh boy! I want to pet that dog so much!!
My dog is exactly the same way
oh sweet bby
I just adopted a senior puggle! She has no teeth. I think she’s perfect.
You have the best morning routine. It’s impossible to leave the house without a smile!
/u/vredditshare
good ol' puppy
Adorable ☺️
u/vredditdownloader
Very cute dog. 🙂
Super cute for his age! Im also curious how you keep the part under your bed so clean!
you da best
I love him
I love him
He is such a goober, and I adore him.
Big pup, big bed, small underneath
Just reminder to trim the dogs nails every now and again when they are long (if you don't know how to do it ask vet).
You are amazing for adopting a senior dog. He’s so lucky to have found you
Man, I'm glad there are people out there who can take care of senior dogs.  I could never do that, I'd be too afraid to lose them right as I get attached.
My puppy used to love to until she got too big
I love it!! Rescues are the best! All 4 of mine are. Bless you for taking him in.
The smile on his face puts a smile on my face
HE LOOKS LIKE SUCH A SWEETHEART
I just want to smush that adorable face......so cute and fluffy......
Bro... This is literally not me!
Why do I feel sad to this dog, seems he used to sleep under cars when as a stray dog, anyway he is lucky
The best boy that ever was! I want to hug him so badly!
my akita does this under the table, we call it his troll hole
Aww! I adopted an 11 yo senior mutt a few years ago. I had 3 wonderful years with her before cancer took her. One of the best dogs I’ve ever had.
Imagine waking up every morning, and finding the best doggo under your bed.
Bless you for adopting a senior! I hope I have the time and ability to do this in the future.
Who said looking under the bed is scary?!
r/bearpuppers
no no no... keep filming
that's a beautiful dog
Your dog is insanely cute and I'm so thankful for you guys for saving him!
That’s really adorable. I can’t stop watching.
Adopting seniors is so rewarding in it's own special way. Adopting any dog from a rescue etc is a wonderful thing, but I have always found adopting seniors special.
Under your bed is his den.
He’s pretending he’s in a snow tunnel.
I love him.
❤️
That old man looks so happy. You must be a good owner :)
Is he part Corgi, they love going under beds. At least coming from my experience watching YouTube clips of them running under beds
What a beautiful dog and good on you for your senior adoption.
Maybe he thinks he’s only allowed to sleep under there
Give him some blankets, make a fort
What a beautiful pup.  I was never able to have a dog when I was growing up.  Now I have my own dog and I cannot tell you how happy she makes me!!  So glad this senior brings you such joy as well.
Aww man! We adopted a 13 year old beauty a few years ago, only had her for a year but it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life! Was such a good dog!
Aww man what a cutie. He looks so happy and pure. 😭
This is so cute! But I would not recommend this. Our dogs hide under the bed during thunderstorms and one time the mattress fell on top of him, luckily we were close by. But having one or two people on would be devastating for the pup :(. You never know what could happen
Cute 😍
Your dog is perfect!
He looks so happy! Thank you for taking a chance on a senior dog. Hugs...
Beautiful boyo
For beautiful people 
Hugs and pats xxxx
Thank you for adopting an older pup. They need forever homes to happily live out the rest of their years. <3
khob bekiram :/
But what if you wanna boink? Poor lad doesnt deserve to get beaten
Maybe get him a crate and throw a blanket over it. Seems like he wants to den. Since he’s a old guy, a crate might be easier on his joints instead of having to crawl in and out from under your bed every day. Thanks for adopting a senior!
Worthy of an awwww
Does he perhaps want a kennel or some place that's his own?
Aw!!
That is one happy and precious face!!!
ALWAYS ADOPT AND RESCUE
I can't be the only one who read it as señor doggo.
Top boi nonetheless.
So cute!
That looks like one happy boi
Awesome
We adopted a 7+ year old cat. This is her coming out to eat/socialize. But not quite as dorky, cause she's a kitty lol
He’s so cute I cried.
It’s almost 1am for me, and I am... crying from overwhelming happiness.
He is so cute!! I'm glad he found a loving home!!
Enjoy it while you can, my old boy passed today and I don't know what to do with myself. You're giving your doggo a great life so be proud of that!
The corgi under the bed
/u/stee4vendetta
My childhood dog did the same thing, unfortunately she passed away while under my bed. Just something to keep in mind
This is much better than having a monster under the bed!
Awww he looks like a zigzagoon!
OMG SOoOoOOoo Cute😳
Good on you guys. Seriously. He looks like a very sweet boy.
He looks suss on you.
Look at that beautiful FACE omg I have not seen such an innocent/babby-looking older dog, he's so precious!
You can tell he's still got some anxiety but he looks like he's adjusting well. He just needs lots of pets.
As someone who rescued an older dog also, I'm curious, how does your dog respond to commands? Now that my Jack Russell is around 13/14 (We don't know exactly as he was found on the streets), sometimes he just ignores commands or sounds he used to react to, like being called to go outside, or even people entering the home. He used to be so excitable and curious but now he's almost like a grumpy old man who sleeps in his chair lmao.
My dog used to slept under my mom's bed, mom doesn't cool with that because my dog made noise during the night (scratching the floor, snoring etc).
We dogsit a husky once in awhile and she prefers to sleep under the bed than on the bed.
So cute
How could you ever have a bad day again if they all start like this. Certainly cheered up my Monday morning
I can't wait to adopt some senior doggos some day 🥰
Den instincts kicking in HARD. My samoyed squishes himself wherever he can to sleep.
So much better
*dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun*
Words cannot describe the noise I made on seeing his face. That is the cutest bundle of fluff I’ve seen in ages
Thank you for adopting.
My dog does like that too
A slow game of peekaboo
That's his cave
Why you rushing him? He's coming as fast as he can.
This is so pure
I wanna cuddle and reward him to the extent his adorable and loving body can tolerate.
It's like a pillow fort, with structural integrity!
He is beautiful
How senior is he? I hope he has many years left after. Man he too cute
All hail pops!
You are a good person
Atka is a beautiful boy!

OLD DOGGY!

OLD DOGGIES ARE THE BEST!!!

Look at how big and happy and fluffy old his old grandpa doggy smile is, and his big old fluffy old doggy fur and old grandpa doggy head is!
Oh my gosh what an absolute cutie! The way he shuffles so adorable.
AWWWWWWWW
Thanks for this wholesomeness on Monday morning
He is a Good Boi
oh he looks so cute! lets give some love for senior puppies!
he reminds me so much of my bb spike
:D
this made my heart feel so kind. Thank you for giving him a chance
Good
He's a sneaker! :)
Look at that smile!!!!
I love him.
This makes me want to adopt a floofer like yours, our dog only barks at everything, there can be the tinyest forx outside our window and she will go to town in the window, sometimes knocking down the plants, i guess you can say "its a hard knock life"
OMG those cute eyes!!! My heart melted 😍❤️
Read as señor doggo
So cute! Does he like the tight feeling or do you think he'd be happier if you got some dorm room bed risers to temporarily raise the bed up?
He looks as cute as a puppy would! Look at that smile!
Do you ever feel bad about banging cause you might  be doinking directly on top of him?
u/vredditdownloader
I also have a Malamute and for some reason she does the same
He’s frigging cute.
Always adopt a senior dog if you can. 

Most people overlook them and want a puppy but a senior dog will love you just as much, and be just as loyal. 

They may not get another chance to be loved as part of a family.
Hes so cute it's ridiculous
Baaawww this makes me happy.
Awww. Moon moons love a good confined space. Mine used to get under the deck outside even at the risk of hurting herself. It was her safe space.
Thank you for taking a senior dog. He is beautiful!
Wow, a video where I wished there *wasn't* sound. That's a first
Oh my god look at his happy face! Hope he brings you as much joy as you've brought him
This video made my day) yell.
So so so so so cute I’m so happy I’ve seen this
he has the sweetest lil face
Thank you for adopting a senior dog. I could never do it constantly, my heart would hurt too much.
 I read it wrong and thought his name was Senor Doggo
Thank you so much for adopting a senior pup!
lookit that sweet baby
Fuck abandoners.
My malamute is 12 and a god damn handful, from peeing herself in her sleep to losing the ability to be alone without howling her ass off (got the cops called on me a few times, by good intentioned people, but still).
I wouldn't give her away for anything, except if she is suffering and putting her down is the only option.

Good on you.
Mal/Corgi sounds like an amazing mix. I hope you enjoy each others company for quite some time ♡
Good on you but not sure I could bring in a dog at that age. The heartbreak would be too much.
Wholesome af 😭
Such a happy dog!!
That's the kind of monster under the bed i want
This is the cutest pet video to come on this site in a long time. Love it.
/u/vredditdownloader
So nostalgic. When my Collie was still around he does that every night as a puppy under any furniture. Then one day when he grew too big, it became a morning rescue routine where we would hear him whine and cry, "Oh he's stuck under the bed/sofa again." Then when he is free, it's like we released him and he scurries to his toilet to take a long leak.

Then finally one day, he gets it that he grew too big and gives up squeezing under furniture again.

But was such an adorable routine to have to save him every morning.

That whining and crying was like our morning alarm clock .
Monster Inc. 4
Seems like he likes the enclosure, maybe get him a doggy crate to sleep in he might enjoy it!
Super precious!!!
I thought he would get stuck. 😜
He happ.
We adopted a 10 year old German Shepherd. Her name is Megan and she's great. She was a trained K9 unit, but she was too sweet so they retired her. We're lucky to have her.
Fluff
My heart
Aw, look how happy he is to start his day.
I love him 😭💕
My Australian Shepard/Poodle mix sleeps under our bed too! He gets too hot laying with us through the entire night. We ended up raising our bed safely for him so he has more room 😊
Aww
The floofmonster under the bed.
It thinks it’s a doghouse
Hey there you woke up awwwww....
Big floof world sighs in relief
Are you Caboose?
awwh he commeth
Omg!!! So adorable and fluffy!!!
i love him
What a hecking good boi
Kawaii. I love husky. Too adorable for words.
cuddle mode : ON
Omg he’s so floofy and happy I love him so much.
I’ve only ever had one dog, and she used to dk this with me.  I miss her a lot.
That is one happy doggo! :-)
Nice
What a sweetie! So glad he is with you and living his best life. We have an older lab and our vet just put him on Galliprant, which helps with pain and inflammation in older dogs. Can be a bit pricey but love seeing my dog playing like a puppy again.

Aw
Please spoil him.
Cf
Awwwww, this is so cute
Such a handsome old poot
Hello

Is it me you are looking for
God bless you
Hey, does he sleep under the bed because a) he can't get up on the bed or b) his previous owners wouldn't let him up on the bed or c) he just likes it there. Handsome puppy and adorable  ;)
Senior dogs rock! Thanks for adopting a senior.
What a champ
Here he comes here he comes here he comes HERE HE COMES HERE HE COMES
He needs Instagram
Silly Puppy. ❤
What a cutie!!!
You’re a good person, this is awesome to see.
The monster you have under your bed is adorable.
A pet like a dog is our best friend. Once it accepts you, you are the whole of its world. It will give you loyalty and love, and hope that we can love it and become each other's family, just like the name In the movie called the loyal dog Hachiko.
Senior dogs are extremely under rated
What a cutie
Why do I love this so much
Awwww what an adorable doggo
So cute!!
my dog loved sleeping under the bed aswell until one day it didn't came out for his walk.. saddest day of my life
Lol
I love him so much!
Please we need more pictures and videos.
There's a monster under the bed. It's fluffy and licks my feet if they hang over the edge.
❤
My dog is 10. She sleeps under my parents' bed and it's funny in the morning because she claws around and drags herself out from under there. It makes so much noise. Hardwood floors and claws don't mix well
You are good people
Must be a husky thing. Mine does the same thing.
The way he crawls tho awwwww
In love 🥰
e y e b r o w s  :’-)
Doggo: Connoisseur of Farts?
Old dogs are so innocent. They’re a special kind of it.
I feel as though maybe his previous owners didn't allow him on the bed, but he wanted to be as close to them as possible so he found a loophole and went under the bed.
dogs are the best people
I'm in love.
Omg look at that sweet baby ♥️♥️♥️ senior pups are the best
Can you put some small spacers under the legs of your bed and raise it just a few inches so he can get out easier?
That's not a senior dog, it's just a big puppy
My #1 test for determining how psychopathic a given person is is by observing their “dog voice.” You have passed.
Now that’s a monster I’d love to have under my bed
What a happy pup!
I need him
I love cats more than dogs but lately I been wanting to get a puppy. Sadly my GF don't want animals in the house.
I love you so much and don't know you at all.  What a wonderful thing you're doing!!
What an adorable pupper. Thank you for adopting a senior dog. <3
Is he scared or just silly
He looks like the pupper from UP!
Thank you for loving him, he's gorgeous <3
Seniõr doggo
My husky / Mal mix does this! Cutest thing ever
i wanna hug him so bad!
Aw, he’s just a big ol’ bear isn’t he. Absolutely gorgeous doggie! :)
Thank you for adopting a senior dog! Not many people do that and it’s a shame.
He Is .... ADORABLE!!!  I love him already.
U know the dog is loved when OP talks to the dog in a higher tone. This put a smile on my face, thank you!
OMG, you're so lucky to have a doggo like him. Such a sweetie.
This is such a cute dog
I think he likes to hear moanings a lot.
Senior dogs are amazing to have. We have two little old ladies at home and some days are hard but I can’t imagine my life without them. We don’t know their exact age about around 13 is what we think (from a vet) 
They spent their first 8-9 years in an awful illegal breeding situation and now are taking lots of naps, chasing ducks, and sleeping in their many bed options around our home. Also barking away any potential intruders.
I love doggos so much
/r/OldManDog demands tribute
The goodest boy!
Oh my goodness I just need me a dog like this little guy 😍
Imagine sleeping and you put your leg on the edge of the bed and he just grabs your leg i would freak tf out :P
Not gonna lie, that is one of the most beautiful dogs I have ever seen!
AWWW I LOVE HIM
He’s beautiful. So want to give floofster hugs!❤️
You adopted a doggo that loves to hunt monsters.
Our 8 year old maltese that we rescued also likes to sleep under the bed sometimes.
Oh to wake up and see my fluffy senior dog under my bed with a bright face going :D ready to begin his morning walk
How come I can not make my own post?
Surprise MothaRrrrrufah!
How clean your underbed
So cute! I miss it when my dog was just a pup and could do that, but he's too big now! He'll be 8 years old on February 29th(so it's technically still his second birthday)
Same with our greyhound rescues - any place that felt more secure and cozy.
To cute to be considered creepy. Night guard doggo is great doggo
We have a husky mix who has slept under the bed his whole life (he is 14 now). When he grew up and had his first winter coat he would get stuck(ish) and quietly whine until we dragged him out. We ended up getting a taller bed frame to accommodate him.
What an absolute cutie. Way to go dude, we need more people like you
People who adopt old dogs are saints, kudos to you man.
old pupper!
Happy Doggo :)
If he's not called monster..then you're not enough kid at heart.
What a beautiful sweet pup.
why does this shit have so many upvotws?
#HUG HIM
Anyone else talking baby talk urging him to come out from under the bed?

That is where dogs go to die.. my beagel started sleeping I  the cold damp basement for a year or two before we put her to sleep.
I love him.
Señor doggo!
Great work adapting a senior, thank you.  When my three pass, that is our plan too.
Senior doggo 🤩
Put your bed on risers! My pup refused to stop getting under the bed as he got bigger. Eventually he was squeezing himself in there so much that it took him a few minutes to get out. Now with the risers, it is easy on his old hips
Owner: Who's ready for breakfast?   
Dog: Me! I am ready for breakfast!
Suh’guh’boooyy
I love him! <3
He could have been crate trained and that's the closest thing he can find. My shepherd will sleep in hers with the door wide open, even though we use it for the cats litter box now.... 
Some dogs really grow to LOVE their crates if done correctly.
My Dog did that until I got her a "Cave" of her own. We got her one of the children's play tents and placed her bed inside.  She Loves it!
Ok first of all, you're a legend for adopting a senior pupper and second he's so fucking cute OMG
What a happy vintage pupper!
Thank you so much for adopting a senior doggy. They need love and care just as much as younger dogs. It shows you have a huge heart for taking him in. :)
God bless you for adopting a senior. Your handsome doggo has the very best people!
First of all, tell him we love him. 

We have a husky mix who has done this most of his life. He’s 14 now, and still loves to sleep under the bed most nights, then slowly worm his way back out in the morning.
Aww i love dogs
😍😍
he is so cute😭
Awww thank you for taking care of him <3
I find him adorable and Im not much of a dog lover
Sooooooo cute
Literally everyone liked that
Es un perro hermoso!!!!
Quiero uno igual a ese <3
You're good people. I always feel sorry for older dogs in shelters.
Adorable and so heartwarming. People who adopt senior dogs are truly heroes!

I need this dog
This is so cute
He is so adorable like a malamute mini puppy for life, 💕
Such s happy floof <3
Why I can't leave more than one upvote?
####Best conger eel ever !
Didn’t know you could adopt clouds
r/eyebleach
I want one of this!
You did good! Hes a handsome boy
Nice dog
I love Atka xxxxx
I wonder why s/he sleeps under the bed? Makes me sad to think of possible reasons, but so happy that this pup has a loving, healthy home now. Looks like a sweet dog.
HENLO HUMAN!
U have wolf ass looking ass boeh under u bed meight.
What a goofball weirdo 🥰
Doesn't that mean your dog is anxious?
He looks so happy! You did a great thing with getting a senior dog. Adopting a senior dog is one of the best decisions I've ever made. Ours was a mastiff and he lived to be 13! He was already on the high end of his age expectancy when we got him and we didn't expect to have him long, but you wouldn't be able to tell him from a puppy when we got him home. He was so happy to have a loving family and we were lucky to have him.
TLDR, adopt a senior animal and make their life longer.
RAISE that bed up for that magestic beast!
u/vredditdownloader
11 years old? He’s got plenty years left. All it takes is a daily dose of head scritches and love!
u/vredditdownloader
May I request more videos plzzzz
What a good boy!
More. I want more.
/u/vredditdownloader
You had me at senior doggo. I feel like they're under-appreciated in general :(
Please reinforce the bottom of your mattress.  I hate seeing the bed sag so low you put the dog at risk.  They sell bunk buddies online for decent prices.  We reinforced my son's bed after he got married so it no longer sags under their combined weight.   Some of the bunk buddies can double the total weight your bed will hold and prevent this kind of sagging.
My old pooch would do the same when I was younger. What a good doggo you got there!
This is so cute❤❤❤❤
Oh wow you can really see the corgi in him 😂 so cute 😊
He looks very happy and is super cute
i’m so glad you adopted a senior doggo, they need so much love too, he looks so happy now 😍
Thank you for giving this senior a home   I worked for years at our local pound and have seen to many good dogs get put down. So again thank you. Beautiful fur kid you have there😍
What a cutie!!!
Aww, looks like he just wants to be as close as possible... awesome doggo!
That has to be a nordic dog thing. I have a Huskey and she is 10, but recently she has started going under the bed too. We always thought it was just because she is silly but it is probably more because it gives them the safe feeling of being in a kennel.
I had a pup once who did something like this. We'd call it his lair.
He is so cute. My dog likes being under our bed too. He just hangs out under there sometimes. I think its like his private den space
Y r senior dogs so handsome 😭 I have one and hes so cuteee
Sorry this is a seal
Does he have a kennel?  Might be possible he was raised with one and now misses the security they provide.
You have my respect
Made me smile.
God bless you for adopting a senior dog!
My dog does this too! I always try to get him up in the bed for bedtime, but he scurries into his little cave and curls up. Mine is a little smoller- has an easier time than your army crawling bud.
u/vredditdownloader
Have you considered crate training him?  It seems like he likes the comfort of the small space
Thank you for adopting instead of shopping. And thank you for adopting a senior dog!
I think the dog is adorable, I think you are incredible, because under your bed is truly memorable.
(where is all the stuff, that is put under the bed because there's no where else to keep it?)
"WHO'S A GOOD BOI, UR A GOOD BOI"
Mine does the same!

When is ask "Are you gonna get out of bed soon" he accelerates out. Probably a bit younger though.
"I am smol"
This just made my day, thank you.
Bless him! ❤
I had a mixed lab that started doing that when they reached 8 years old freaked us out because we thought they got out, ran away, so we were searching around the neighborhood. Came back found front half  sticking out smiling when we got back.
Hehehe my boxer loved to sleep or hangout under our bed but she couldn’t get back out. So she’d moan at me until I would come get her; she’d stick we paws out to me and wait to be pulled out. Several times a week, she knew what she was doing.
Maybe try raising your bed a little with some risers so he doesn't have such a tough time sliding out. Such a good boy deserves it.
How do you keep the space under your bed so clean?!?!
He is just an overgrown puppy.🐶
What a handsome doggo
I think it’s so cute when dogs do this since they’re “den”animals and their genetics dictate an affinity for “den like” spaces haha like “aww lil doggo you’re still a wolf on the inside huh?” :)  anyways beautiful dog!
Aww
WHO's A  *G O O D   B O Y*
It’s enough to make a grown man cry, and that’s ok
I Love him!!!
Wholesome af
He deserves to forever live
Señor Doge
I only see one con for senior doggos 



You have less time with them and therefore less memories of your good doggo
I would die for this cutie
My family dog use to do the same. He can't go upstairs anymore so my brother have been sleeping in the living room for almost a year
He looks so happy! 😁
Your post made my day! And she’s or he is a beauty. Good things wished for you guys.
MOMMY THERE IS A FLUFFY BOY UNDER MY BED!
u/vredditdownloader
Omg I want to pet that baby until my hands are no more
Looks a little like our husky. She likes to bury herself and hide in small places too. She just likes her personal space. :-)
Ah the elusive dog noodle
Aw you're such a good person, heart warming :)
Oh lawd he comin
Dogs dont show pain the same way we do. I would get him in for a full body scan. osteosarcoma comes on fast and right around this age. my dog did this for three years. finding spots under things to sleep .Thats them feeling safe to sleep and not get attacked or eaten. He is old and in pain probably and he knows it but cant show or tell you. My scout passed on in september after 13 years of brotherhood.  [https://vimeo.com/365911343](https://vimeo.com/365911343)
I must have him!!
Just curious, how much more expensive is owning a senior dog? Is there any way to negate the price of the much more common vet visits and health problems?
u/vredditdownloader
I love this.
u/vredditdownloader
I love this so much
I need feel the compulsive need to go to the animal shelter and get all the sweet older dogos
Fine dog, there.
So awesome!!
Very cute
u/vredditdownloader
The bestest of boys
He's so cute
What a good doggo!!
Was anyone else brought here by an article on their Google feed? For some reason, it didn't seem to provide a direct link, but I found this post by searching. I'm glad the article brought by attention to this wholesome adorable video.
 so Lovely 
Iam in deep love ❤️😍❤️😍❤️
Those cheeks 😖
Bless you for taking care of this old boi. It can be really hard to get adopted when they're old. People don't want old dogs, but you've given this dog a second chance at life. You're an absolutely amazing person for doing this.
He is sooooooo cute i want one 😭
Does she have a crate? Might benefit her seems like she likes the coverage. I adopted a dog few years back and she did the same thing, think it brought it comfort. We ended up getting a crate for her and she loved it became her new safe place.
I want him
This is a 3 month old post so you won't reply but I need to know how this ball of flluff is doing right now
how do I upvote a post twice please help
That smile tho
Best woofer
Dog man just dog, this is getting cringey.
Our doggo used to do this, until she got stuck, it took a full hour to get her out of here (our bed is attached to the wall)
What's up with "doggo" being used constantly? "Dog" is shorter both verbally and in text.
Like a hecking tremor worm
Please clean under the bed regularly for the puppy sake. I was going crazy when my cat used hide in all the places I had trouble cleaning.
Doggo needs a blanket
cute doggo
The video is cute but please don't say doggo, talk like an adult. Please.
The word doggo though makes me feel ill. It's called a dog. It fb oesnt need a shitty different name.
love this
Special awent doggo weporting for wuty.
Be careful so that bed wont collapse on the doggo.
so you didnt put any pillows or blankets down there? his comfort should come before you whip your phone out.
Reminder 3
Oh fuck yes he looks happy. Good job humans.
Never talk like that again fr🤡
no one cares
I am a well respected canine behavioural expert. I have been studying the behaviour of dogs for the almost 40 years and I am sorry to say this is a sign of canine dementia. It won't belong before you have to have it put down. Sorry to break the news to you.
