Congratulations my fellow American 

Don‚Äôt forget to treat yourself as well
Such a big deal, amazing!
There is something deeply touching about seeing someone come from another country, and upon seeing a creature in need on his front porch, immediately taking it in and caring for it.

Congratulations, you are a testament to the human spirit, my friend.

Edit: Thanks for the awards, guys! I'm just glad my comment could have so much positivity.
This kind of reaction has blown me away! It is overwhelming. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for you encouraging and awesome comments fellow Reddit users . I am a proud US citizen and animal lover. More info about Camila my cat: she was only around three months old when I found her . She was underweight  and had several red spots due to flea infestation. I took care of her and nowadays, she is a joyful pet... btw I will give her cat nip instead of raw fish based on some comments . Have a wonderful day tomorrow guys
 Thank you so much. I believe in destiny and my destiny is to have a long time great companion in the form of a little furry creature!
It's a great day!! For you, the USA and that sweet cat!! Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Congrats to you both! May both your futures be positive and uplifting!
Congrats man! Welcome home.
Congratulations !! Please reconsider the raw fish treat , it can carry bacteria that leads to food poisoning.
Thank you for coming here and joining us! May your contribution continue to make us all stronger and better people.
Congratulations!
One of us! One of us! 

But really, congratulations and welcome home. You and your blessed kitty are very very welcome here.
Big days all around! Seriously really happy for you, I‚Äôve seen my dad cry exactly twice in my life, when we had to put down the family dog, and when he became a US citizen. Proud to call you my countryman!
Congrats!
Congratulations on your achievement!  


P.S: Fish is not a natural part of the cat's diet and can cause diarrhea and hair loss, it's better to buy tuna in water and draining the water onto the cat's food.

I am proud to have you as a fellow citizen. 

You are kind enough to take in a friend in need, AND you know how to use ‚Äúwhom‚Äù correctly. 

We‚Äôre lucky to have you. Best of luck!
Congratulations and good on you! I know the road to becoming a citizen is a long and difficult - and sometimes frustratingly complex - path. You and your sweet kitty deserve a night of celebration!
Congrats, your ambition, drive and willingness to take risks is part of what the American Dream is all about. You and your kitty should be proud.
I'm sure that was a very long process, congratulations!
yeah dude cats are cool
I see that red, white, and blue outfit you're rocking. :) Congrats man.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!!?????

I juuuuuuuust came back from a naturalization ceremony on Constitution Day.  The VERRRRRRRRRRY first thing the director of UCIS said was DO NOT POST PHOTOS OF YOURSELF WITH YOUR CERTIFICATE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.  Bro, you're holding up a document with allllllllllllllllllll of your personal info on it and broadcasting it to the world.  The only things ID thieves need are your name and DOB. The doc you're holding up has more than that on it, plus your photo.  I get that its a low quality photo, but who knows what kind of image software people have out there these days?
You and your cat are the most beautiful things I've ever seen
First. Congratulations!

Second, I scrolled through the replies and I am very happy to see no negative comments.  Nice work fellow commenters.
>unsubs from /r/pics.

>this post.

God.  **Damnit.**
Very cool. Lucky friend.
Congratulations!
Congratulations and welcome to the melting pot! Where are you from originally and were you able to keep that citizenship as well? It's nice that you and your cat found each other. Sometimes we need them as much as they need us.
I love my cat what I can say. I post also travel video and stuff . Who cares dude!
Female, orange kitties are pretty uncommon! Congrats on your citizenship! How exciting!
What country did you move from?
Congrats. You are the hope and future of this country. I'm proud to have you with us.
Congratulations! What a beautiful pic with your buddy ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Where you from buddy? Welcome to America!
We're proud to have you, fellow American!!
True but she does love me. She purr several times per day. She loves to stop by and lick me and try to play . She has plenty of energy
Hahaha yes indeed. It looks like she did not want to be in the picture lol
Her long-cat-con of six years has finally paid off...
Yay! Good for you! Welcome and make yourself at home. Beautiful cat.
Congrats! Both of you look very happy!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
[deleted]
Congrats my friend, out of curiosity where are you migrating from?
Hey man glad to have ya.
Welcome to America! You're a kind, gentle man. The cat loves you!!
Just wanna say love the suit very nice
So sweet! Good Luck
Congratulations & she looks proud of you as well.
i think your kindness to your cat is admirable
Congratulations!!
This is freaking adorable
Congrats!
Congrats! I would love to hear what the process was like for you. I keep hearing the politicians talking about legal immigration and I know there‚Äôs a lot of skewed information. I would love to hear what you went through if you‚Äôre willing to share!
Congratulations and welcome!!!
So proud of you! We are a better people now with you as part of us.
Youre the kind of person this nation needs.
Congratulations! ‚ù§ü•∞ü§ó
Congratulations!
Congratulations!!!! I dig the outfit!!!
People from other countries: what makes America so beautiful ü•∫
Congratulations! Well deserved!! 

Btw- that subwoofer would sound a lot better on the ground :)
This is such a cute picture! Congratulations!
Congratulations on your citizenship and being adopted by your cat!   Two very momentous occasions. üòÄ
Congrats on becoming a citizen and your newest member of you family.  This is awesome news!
Congrats brother! What s great cat! Here's to you and your pal having the best time!
Very happy for you! And your cat lol. Congratulations!
Welcome aboard, damn glad to have you.
Kudos and congrats....to both of you.  :)
Congratulations!
U have every reason to be proud & I am quite proud of u, as well! I know that naturalized citizens are required to learn SO MUCH more than native-born Americans do to graduate high school & college ( if not  political science majors & the like). I know for a fact that u know more about our government & our history than the current POTUS & his ilk. I wish I could meet u to give u a  hearty, congratulatory hand-shake. I'm so glad u met someone here who has been a hard to become a citizen. U 2 look as if u 2 were just meant to be in each other's lives!
Is this fucking /r/pics now?
Congrats!!
Congratulations!üéäüéà
Welcome and proud to have you! üá∫üá∏ üò∏
Congratulations on the citizenship and finding this lovely baby.
Welcome fellow citizen and cat lover. I wish you and your feline owner the best.
Congrats dude...
Congrats!
Great work! Welcome.
Congratulations from another female orange cat owners. They are so special and not just because they are rare. My girl is so different than any other cat I have owned.
That is awesome about the cat (mine respond most to tuna and salmon, although I've always felt like snapper is tragically underrated fish meat), and in regards to your citizenship status: welcome, and I promise our government isn't always this loony.
I have a big ol' crush on you and your cat.
Congratulations!!! And I‚Äôm sure your little buddy will love her treat!!! üòä
How did you do it?  Congrats!!
She looks very proud of you!!
Dude have you ever seen The Wire? You look like Mcnulty
Welcome! Now all of the world's problems are your fault, too! Hooray!
I recommend cooking the fish. 

Raw fish can have parasites.
Congrats dude! And thank you for saving your kitty! My kitty was a rescue from outside too. She's a bitch sometimes but I love her all the same. :)
Congratulations! I can‚Äôt imagine how difficult it must be moving to a whole new country, AND going through the citizenship process (which I know takes years in this country).
True statement . You never know what  post would become viral. When I grew up, I thought I was very ugly . Since then, I just did not care for what people think of me . Did my post deserved this kind of reaction? noooo . But I think is it because of the love for animals plus the the fact US citizens value someone who is legal and become citizen .
You are awesome! Your cat is awesome! Welcome to America, friend.
Congrats! The cat‚Äôs Bright-Eyed and Bushy-Tailed !!!
Congrats! You were an American before you were a citizen :)
Congratulations!
Welcome!
Welcome to you and congratulations! I hope you and your kitty are happy here!
Congratulations!
Welcome! This country is so much richer with you as a citizen. I hope you and your kitty friend have nothing but the brightest days together.
Welcome fellow citizen! Hope you register to vote!
Congratulations!
Congrats!
Welcome home.
This is awesome!

On a side note, I hope you checked her for a microchip to make sure she is not someone else's cat in the neighborhood.
A citizen AND a cat owner?

You're crushing it man.
My sister and my brother in law had their immigration interview today. They drove 5 hours and paid for their lawyer to fly out there. 4 hours before the interview was supposed to start the lawyers office called and said they just recieved mail that morning that the interview was canceled. They were pissed, and now they have to pay for the whole thing again whenever they get a new interview date. Im happy for you op, and welcome to the shit show.
I‚Äôm American and going to become a Mexican citizen. I hope people congratulate me.
If you are a US citizen, please vote and be responsable for our country!
Congrats dude
She looks like she can already smell the fish
Every new American gets a cat, as is tradition.
That is a really beautiful post, dude.  Congrats to you on your new citizenship.  I became a US Citizen in.....200........8, maybe?  I can't remember.  But it was such a profound moment - even here in shitty Arkansas.  It is a strange and powerful moment.  Looks like you have the right crew to celebrate with!!
Welcome to the family. Please use your newfound rights to improve the lives of those around you.
Grats but don‚Äôt do it. Once cats have had a taste for it they forever crave that shit
Congratulations!!
May our future country do a better job of welcoming you. Until then congratulations on a long sought goal and welcome to our jungle. It may not seem like it always but the country is pleased you are here. Please ignore the assholes.
People like you are what make America truly great! Thanks for having faith in our country, despite its many failures. Hopefully we can work together to enact change! Never forget you are *welcome* here!!! Thank you!
Those cat's eyes are so giant!
Congrats I'm kind of proud of you for going through the legal process it proves you respect the country. Since you went through the legal process I can tell your serious about living here so welcome, you're an American like the rest of us now. I really hope america lives up to your expectations!

(I also really love the cat super cute and reminds me of mine)
Congratulations my fellow American, and our country is made that much greater by people like you. So happy for you today, and every day!
Congratulations and welcome!
Congratulations!!!

Congratulations.  Why is the subwoofer on the desk and not the floor?
Congrats to you both!
Welcome home!
Welcome home!
So happy for you!!! I have 2 uncles who immigrated and then found my lovely aunts. Both from places that are vilified by the current administration and society. (Mexico and Jordan - after 9/11 I was very scared for the people I love and still am) They both helped me appreciate where I was born so much more than my peers. I grew up with citizenship papers being framed and displayed as a normal thing. I hate that it is so hard to become one of us these days but I am so happy when someone is able to jump the ridiculous hurdles to come to a country of immigrants.
[removed]
I have no doubt she will enjoy that in a pretty serious way. Congratulations friend. Best to the both of ya!
Congratulations! And super cute little lady there!
People you have to sort this by controversial
Yeah, yeah, becoming a US citizen is cool and all... but the really impressive thing is getting a cat to pose so well for a picture.

When we say bring the best and brightest, we weren't expecting literal super heroes.
Me too I became a citizen today! Hooray!
Congrats on youre new citizenship
Welcome to the USA, fellow citizen!
CONGRATULATIONS üéâüéâüéâ
Hello. I was born and raised in Colombia

Congratulations!  You now know more about the US Government than the US President.
Doing it right like a True American . Not the easy way like some socialist handout seeking scumbag
Congratulations!! I am so happy for you! The amount of work and dudiligence that is required to achieve this moment is quite ridiculous.  It should not be this tough! You know you are officially American because you have a free loading bastard that expects everything for free.... even though Hes a cute free loader, he will still eat better than you in the tough times. Lol . Welcome Sir! You most likely have more pride in this country then most of the people who were born into it.
Congratulations! What a lucky little kitty! And I  am glad she showed you the love they can give!!
I will vote for sure . That is our responsibility as US citizens. Have a great day
That's awesome! They make it WAY too difficult and stressful to come to this country legally. I'm glad you're beaming with pride and that you have someone Awesome to celebrate with ‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòÅüëç

Damn dude, props to you. My parents have been in the US for over 25 years and they still don‚Äôt have their citizenship lol
Congratulations, and that means that it's highly likely that you know more about American history & civics than most of the people who grew up here :-)
deported
So we can all agree that coming the legal way and getting a cat is good for Reddit? Right??
Right on man! Welcome to being a US citizen. Doing it legally and professionally I‚Äôm sure gives you a great sense of accomplishment. Don‚Äôt let the media tell you that Americans hate immigrants... I‚Äôm married to one and wish the best for you on your future!
Congratulations and welcome to the family. We're a bit dysfunctional at times, but overall pretty awesome. Glad to have you!
Welcome to the shit show.
I know you‚Äôve been told this literally a thousand times over already and that me saying this probably doesn‚Äôt mean jack shit to anybody but really, congrats. I don‚Äôt know what made you come to America, but whatever it is, good on you man. I hope you enjoy life to the fullest here and take advantage of what this country has to offer.
Welcome! And vote!

Congratulations on your big achievement and welcome to the United States, my friend. Hope you feel at home.
Congratulations! I deeply respect a person that goes through the process and achieves that piece of paper. Not sure if it‚Äôs the same for everyone but the people I know had to spend years jumping through hoops and giving pieces of themselves just for a chance to have a chance.
Hell Yeah Brother. Welcome my fellow American. I must say, cats are awesome and may you prosper sir.
Congratulations and welcome!!!!

Congratulations! Aaaww, you can see how proud she is of her dad.

Congratulations!  I wish I felt prouder of the country you're joining.  But it's stories like this that make this place great.  

Your adopting that cute kitty and spoiling it rotten makes us all a little better than we were before.  

Glad you're here.  Hope we live up to the standard you're setting.

Hi Cesar,

First and foremost congratulations to you, I'm happy for you and glad that you're proud. 

If I may ask, could you tell me why it is that you're proud to be a U.S. Citizen now? What about becoming a citizen makes you proud and what brought this to you? 

I did read/scan all the posts but didn't see why, forgive me if I missed or overlooked a post.
Congrats. üò∏
Congratulations man this makes me so happy. I can't even imagine how difficult this process probably was.
I clearly remember how happy we were when my parents, sister, and I finally got our citizenship (after twenty years of trying). Congratulations!!
Welcome friend! We need more and more people with kind hearts like yours.
Congratulations! I wish you well in your future endeavors!
Wow what a wonderful gift to give yourself. Congratulations
Congrats!
Welcome to the citizen's club, my friend! We truly live in the greatest country.
Congrats! And that‚Äôs a cutie cat!
Welcome.
Hell Yeah!!! üá∫üá∏
Congrats, my friend. It‚Äôs an honor to be your fellow American!
Congrats!!! So happy to have you here - but for the record. Dogs are even better than cats!
You can now officially gain an extra 80lbs and fit right in with the rest of us.
This is the very first thing that popped up in my feed when I opened Reddit. I‚Äôm so happy for you and for that cat.

I feel like I should close Reddit for the night and end on a high note...
Congrats friend!
I'm loving all the positive comments on here. It's a breath of fresh air üôÇ
Congrats, may your spirits soar like a bald eagle
Congratulations to you and your new pet!!!!

Nice cat!  Congrats on becoming a citizen, welcome to the club.  I hope that you become the best of us.
Became a citizen AND a cute cat pic?  This is re-edit gold my friend.  Congrats on the cat.
Welcome! I'm naturalized too - registering and going to vote is the most important thing you can do. The cat chose wisely. :)
Hello fellow American! Your cat looks like a good friend.
Welcome! You have a real American spirit! Thank you for joining our country at this difficult time and bringing optimism (and a kitty!). I hope you are able to realize you own American Dream.
So adorable, congratulations and God bless you
Welcome, fellow American! People like you make us great :)
