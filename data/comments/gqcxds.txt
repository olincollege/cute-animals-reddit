Cool fact - If you ever wonder why bee suits are white it’s because most bees associate dark colored things with predators that want to steal their honey! Mainly bears! If you ever get head butted by a bee around a hive, leave the area immediately! They think you are a predator!
I shall call him squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my squishy.
This is the most pure thing I've seen in a very long time. It made me smile ear to ear, thank you for sharing!
This is me as a 30 year old. May your four year old always be fascinated by the world around them!
Look at the smol rain boots!

This used to be me, my parents were beekeepers. I’d come to school with outrageous stories for the class like “we were putting bees in a field and my dad ran over an old TV set and got stuck” this of course sounded like a crazy lie coming from a preschooler..

I can remember my parents coming home after moving bees and bees being still stuck to them when they came back in the house, then I’d wake up with bees flying around in my room and sometimes I’d get stung before even getting out of bed!

Beekeeping sucks, i had to help a lot when i was older.  It’s a lot of heavy lifting, getting sticky, getting stung and getting up early also those suits are hot as Fuck. People romanticize it now but it was zero fun as a kid..

I do remember catching bugs like this kid while wearing my new suit.  I’d have a butterfly net and be catching all sorts of weird bugs while my parents set down bees in the cotton fields west of Fresno.

When I was really little 4-5 my parents would leave me alone in the truck and I’d entertain myself with whatever was in the truck as this was the early 90’s so no video games really or smartphones. I didn’t get a gameboy till later. in this case tools.    So i was alone in the truck bored while my parents were working and I started taking the inside of the truck apart with the tools.  I had the door handles and window cranks off and was jamming matches into the ignition lock, not sure why.  So when my parents got back they couldn’t get the truck open and then couldn’t get the key in the ignition and they were in the middle of nowhere...

Extracting honey is my all time worst experience.  My parents had a decent sized operation 500-800 beehives, so we had to extract honey a couple times a year.   This involves taking the honey combs out of the bee boxes and installing them into a machine that cuts the to caps off of the little cells the bees puke the honey into (yes honey is bee puke).  But the machine would miss sections of the combs so we would have to go back through and hand scratch them. I’d get covered in honey and my shirt would stick to my belly,  and bees were a lot of time still around or in these combs and they would get stuck to me and sting 

Once the combs were hand scratched they had to be installed in big centrifuges called extractors, these would spin the honey out and it would be pumped into a tank.  The whole process had to be done in a building that was kept at a temp of around 115-120 degrees using steam so the wax and honey would flow.. so it was hot as FUCK and wet and sticky...   



I’m a mechanic now go figure, i was offered the opportunity to take over beekeeping and I said NO
My son would go bonkers if he got to be a beekeeper for a day! He went from being mortally terrified of bees at three to being a six year old who's self-proclaimed favorite outdoor activity is "bee watching". Time to see if I can make that a thing.
Unsolicited advice:  get some lighter colored boots for beekeeper.  The bees don't like the darker colors.
I don't know the first thing about beekeeping, but can they sneak into the cracks on her rainboots?
This made me say "Awwww," irl!  So cute; thanks for posting.
BEE-yootifully captured. 😊
This is why the minimum age to become a beekeeper was raised to 5.
Brave kid, you would have a hard time finding adults willing to fuck with bees.
Love their wee wellies❤️
Anyone else notice how rare rolypolys are now compared to before? I remember as a kid any stone upturned had dozens, now seeing one is a nostalgic miracle.
I just wanna roly-poly roly-poly roly-poly roly-poly roly-poly roly-poly roly-poly roly-poly roly-poly roly-poly
I'm not sure why but I thought I saw a swan
What's a roly-poly?
What's a roly-poly?
I love that they make beekeeper outfits for four-year-olds, that is so precious.
it's the roly poly Pope! His holy roly polyness
For some reason this makes me so happy and joyful. 
It really did made me smile,  I am going to share it. 

Thank you for posting, keep smiling  :) :)
Every time I see a beekeeper outfit I keep thinking back to that one Nicholas Cage seen where he screams "Not the bees!" That shit scared the living ass out of me when I was little.
These child labour workers just don’t have the same dedication as the previous generations
"I caught a pill bug! That's a tough act to swallow!"

Whats a roly poly?
it's got a kind of r/accidentalrockwell vibe to it.
Rookie mistake
Whatcha thinkin’ bout? 

Nothin’, just bee stuff
This is me I would like to touch them and watch them curl up into a little ball.
At first i didn’t read the part of it being a four year old and felt even more love for this being hahahah
Gotta have priorities.
She was quite beesy with her studies.
34 years old and I still have to say hello to them lil pill  bugs!
Is this near Austin, TX?
that’s adorable😇
I recently learned that rolly-pollies are land based crustaceans.
If you squint a little he looks like an fresh adidas sneaker
I can’t bee the only one who thought this was a body bag at first glance...
All I can say is that her life looks pretty plain.
In my family we called them granny Grey's because in my great grandmother's house she had 100s of them and they were grey so"GRANNY GREY"!
This is actually adorable.
Post corona play time

This is soooo cute. The head us bigger than the rest of his body
What is a roly poly
Adorable. Updooted.
After seeing a woman kick a bus driver in the face repeatedly...needed this
This remember me the first time my daughter Saw a Ladybug, from that day we pronounced it like her "laadybu" it is funny she is ten and we still use her baby words ,😆🥰🥰
Whats a roly poly?
awwww 🥰
Maybe theirs a bee in his suit.
That's me playing softball/kickball.
ah yep, the birth of the elusive "Roly-poly keeper!"
For a brief moment there, I thought Altaïr missed his haystack.
That's a future entomologist!
Awesome
Nice
looks very comfortable
It's hard to find good employees these days
Fuck those bugs... Eat my strawberries!
Oh to be a little child delighted by a roly poly.
This made my day. I’ll always get distracted by a roly-poly.
This reminds me of that supposed “Alien” photo.
I didn't know they made these suits in tiny form!
Time to play Beekeeper/fencer.
God I used to love playing with them when I was little, now i want to keep them as pets!
I was reading barkeeper and honestly, I'm a bit disappointed that it's not...
“There’s a bee in my suit! Ahhhh!”
I thought it was a swan at a quick glance lol cute!
Dawwwwwwwww
Who isn't distracted by a Roly poly??? That made my day.
I thought it meant he had been a beekeeper for 4 years and he was just very easily distracted
I thought it was a turkey in clothes
That is absolutely precious!
Fun fact. Roly polys (pill bugs) aren't actually insects, they're crustaceans, one of the only that is fully terrestrial.
TIL beekeepers can start young
I'm imagining this as a Bansky piece of a child in a Hazmat suit admiring a butterfly.
Plot twist: it’s actually a little person who tripped
Adorable 😍
There’s no way he should be guarding the queen
As someone who has had a bee crawl into my shoe and up my suit leg while beekeeping, I appreciate his lil booties.
Man, this picture made me realize I'd probably enjoy being out in nature more if I wore a beekeeper suit and nothing could touch me.
So this isn’t the new mandatory school uniform for next year?

I kid, she’s adorable.
That's just basic PPE for roly-poly enthusiasts.
Well that's just friggin adorable. 

But I can't imagine there's a huge market for 4 year old sized beekeeper suits.
I love roly polys.
not sure why I first saw a poorly made dummy turkey
My kid is the exact same way. It looks like it’s a four year old thing
Gotta have your priorities
i need karma safe
Awww...I miss my son being that age. This is the cutest little beekeeper ive ever seen.
Woww
Bobs 4th yearly performance review:

Bob now 46 years old and only 4 years into his beekeeping career constantly gets distracted by the smallest outside factors. 

Bob also constantly reminds us about his birthday and what he refers to as his bzzzday which coincides with this yearly review.
I’ve never seen a young beekeeper in the wild before
This is off topic, but is it true that if you wear colored clothing bees will think you’re a flower and fly towards you??
Christina’s World
Dammit Jerry
He’s looking me wooeee dewwwd
For the uninitiated! Sure as might mistake him for an alien 👾
Bees: TRAITOR!
It’s interesting to me that they make 4 year old sized bee keeper outfits.
Four year old *Roy-poly* keeper. **FIFY**
That’l do little bug. That’l do
Space coupe now I’m a space cadet

Where did you find such a tiny bee-suit?
Haha! The size of that little girl with that giant face mask is hilarious.
I think that's the [Solway Firth's Spaceman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solway_Firth_Spaceman) kid.
Rolly polly
The thumbnail looks like a THICC swan
One of the most precious photos I’ve ever seen.
This could very easily pass as my mother. She's a very tiny beekeeper. With questionable balance. Also she likes wine.
Was so funny at the time for me, we had a british exchange student come to us in high school in America. She pointed out one of them and I said yea “we have a lot of rolly pollys” and she was like “what?” And I said yea that’s what we call them here and hearing her laugh was one of the most amusing things I’ve heard.
He will be known though out history
If you kinda unfocus and fudge it a little, it looks like a pigeon where his feet are the head and his body is its body.
That's too cool
Kids going to day on the green for the last day of school 2020
*ya like jazz?*
Is a roly poly not something u do in gymnastics as a child
This is my favorite picture. Thank you.
THAT PRESCHOOL DEGREE IN BEES WAS A WASTE!
Now that’s the way to raise a kid! Well done!
....Roger?
Caught a glimpse of this picture when scrolling through and I won't lie I thought this was a picture of a weird-ass turkey
Looks like Appa if you squint really hard
This has to be the cutest pic I have seen in a long while, Thank you for sharing.
What's Roly poly??
Man that’s like an invincible suit for a young kid, get to check out all the cool bugs with no venom bite to pair with them!
Me a 26 year old would be laying right next to him
Made because I’m English, maybe because I’m dumb, I didn’t realise until the comments that roly-poly didn’t mean a literal role where you tuck your head in and roll forward (as it does where I live). I guess TIL roly-poly is a type of bug too

Did anyone else see a goose with a bright red head at first?
But do you employ any bee freers?!?!?
There is a downvote conspiracy going on!
You know what? Maybe I will lol thanks for the idea
Adorable!

I understood the title as an employee of 4 years. lol
I thought it was spring pictures during quarantine

Those things will bore a hole into your head, so better to be safe.
If you were ever in a bee suit you would not think it was cute. It's so hot in them. It's like being locked in a car on a hot summer day with the window barely cracked.  It cruel and a child should never be out in that situation.
He probably getting stung to fuck. "Look dear, he's doing a roly poly, get the camera!"
So sorry to hear
 tag yourself im the kid in the PPE suit
plot twist: he wasn't paying attention and didnt see a swarm of giant asian hornets coming to him and he dies
