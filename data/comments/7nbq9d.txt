I love the delayed reactions. So cute!
A puppy pile!
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon 
The puppies apparently belong to a place in Utah called Green Valley Aussies. They breed the dogs as well as train them for farm work and showing.

This is apparently a mix of 4 different litters from 4 different mamas. The place looks pretty clean and the dogs all well-kept, so that‚Äôs good. 
Perfect amount of puppies per m^3

Litter of puppies at my house at the moment. Very familiar with this. =D
Why are all these puppies sleeping in dirt ???
Hooman!? Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman!
‚ô´‚ô™ He's the man ! with the food and the ball ! ‚ô™‚ô´

How did you know which house we were in ?

Look at these heckin freeloaders, GET A JOB YOU BUMS! 
That has got to be at least 2 litters, right? No way one dog can carry that many puppies. 
From the thumbnail picture, I thought it was a bunch of Roombas lol 
I love how they are sleeping huddled together like that. So cute and cozy
Contrary to popular belief, these organisms are actually a collective and form a superorganism - some say that the species is an offshoot of Supercute puppylickus
This. Is. A. DREAM üòç
That's a lot of puppers
It‚Äôs like that scene in Dunkirk when the soldiers notice the fighter plane coming. 
The puppy's burst to life!
PUPPY STAMPEDE
It's like a parade of puppies! 
Where do I get one of those magic boxes and how can I climb into that cuddle puddle?!?


Whatever you do, don't get them wet, and don't feed them after midnight.

[Here's the source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvUSNX1beO4) of this gif.

And as others have mentioned in the thread, this is NOT a puppy mill. This is from a responsible breeder called Green Valley Australian Sheperds.
Guinea dogs!
Is this one litter?
/r/awwakeup would love this, please x-post!

I'd love to pet all of those puppies
When I die send me here
Do I see an Old English Sheeodog or two in there?
fuck men only 5 seconds video.
Aussies!!!
I gasped
Wait, there was only about 15 or 20 there... Where are the other 81-86?
I counted 17 puppies. Did one dog have 17 puppies???!!!
Human detected...

Is it healthy to keep that many puppies?
I‚Äôm just wondering why this many puppies are behind a wooden plank...
I don't mean to be that guy, but there's a typo in the title. Sorry, I am that guy
farm dog had a litter, iirc.

Contrary to what people say, this isn't a puppy mill. In puppy mills they're kept in cages.
~~IIRC this was a puppy mill~~

Edit: NOT a puppy mill, I did not remember correctly

I‚Äôve been looking for this forever. Thank you :)

This would instantly melt my heart 
Please let me have one pleeeeeease!
Give me puppies
I feel so bad for that pupper momma.... that is a lot of puppers...
I want them all
*"The humans are back!" "The humans are back!" "The humans are back!"*
Went from "Huh seems they don't care that-" to 

"jeebus  how much dogs do you own?"
I want them, I want them all to live with me.
Holy crap the cuteness!

Pretty sure someone just announced they had food. 
I count more each time. I'm up to 18?
Oh sweet honourable Jesus. 
Please never let this gif end
When I get to Heaven this is how I want to be greeted by all the dogs I've loved in my life.

Got a lot more dogs to love before then.
I know I know, so cute. But dammit, if no one else will say it: *human's*
Aussies!!!:)

HAha I'm an overnight Vet tech and that's exactly what happens when I get the kids up for breakfast and morning treatments

Comments were at 666 so I made it 667
this is like the opposite of that gif where someone disturbs a fuzzy pile and spiders go everywhere
Why are they just laying out in the dirt? :( 
Looks like a bunch of Aussies 
Why are they outside?
Oh my gosh, reminds me of when my Aussie had 13 puppies in one litter (with a border collie) they looked just like this!
I hope this is what happens when we arrive in heaven üòçüòçüòç 
The look on any dog‚Äôs face when you get home is enough for most people to brighten up, no matter how bad their day was. I love that.
I want someone to add to the "attention" icon from metal gear.
I believe the scientific term for this is a "clusterpup."
FFFOOOOOODDDDD
OMFG * - *)
To be surrounded by puppies would be my idea of heaven on Earth. They are so adorable and so many, I would feel obligated to hold every single one of them.
Those sweet puppies should be inside :-)
What do I have to do to have this many Australian shepherds?
I'm a grown ass man and I'd loose my shit if I saw all those puppies. 
O.M.G Puppies!!!!
I want one.   
Uhm, yes adorable, but that's alot of puppies at one person's place, what's up with that? 
I don't wanna be rich or famous. I just want this.

The [shadow](https://imgur.com/a/LqWTQ) of a mature dog is their mother. The puppies woke up probably hungry for milk which proves this.

It's *elementary* my dear Watson
This is what heaven looks like. 
Are they border collies or Aussies?
I WANT THE PUPS, please üò≠
Awww, dog breeders!
Are they usually supposed to be left out like that? Looks like a mill :\

Edit: thanks for the responses, TIL :)
Jesus christ, how many puppies did that mama pump out? 
[deleted]
puppy MILL - see the mnumma
This is like the complete opposite of what happens when you find a litter of stay cats.
/u/emhart199 
Why are those puppies in the dirt?!! Give them a home, or at least a home for them to hang out in until the get adopted!
[removed]
Adopt don‚Äôt shop. 
sooo a puppy mill??
This is really sad to see the conditions they are living. 
aww a puppy mill, how cute.
Not to be a downer here but why so many pups? Thats more than just one litter of pups. This isnt one of those puppy mills is it?
Am I the only one that gets sad watching this? The puppies look cold and dejected. üòû 
Ughhhh...breeders
It's a trap!
"Foooooood!!"
They just keep coming!
Where can I get one of these puppers?! They are SO adorable. I live for cute pups like these!!!
A litter of a litter
So that‚Äôs what heaven looks like!
I want all of them.  Until it's time to pick up poop.
I‚Äôm setting an alarm so this is the last thing I see in 2017. 
I wish I knew someone with this many puppers.. I'd visit them more than I visit my grandma. 
Back? How the fuck could someone leave that incredible pile of love!?

That sums up my life in one gif! 

Every year I hope of starting anew but nah life has its own way of throwing problems at me! 

Similar to the pups in the gif, there‚Äôs always a problem I‚Äôm trying to avoid but nah it has to come throw itself on me! 

**Sad life!**

Dogs really do love us as one of their own. So cute.
I NEED THEM ALL

They want food.

Holy Crud! Is that one litter?

This warms my cold heart 
I wish that was me so bad
I need those.

I was really hoping there was one that just slept through the whole thing...
Im trying to spot which one takes the initiative first to make a move towards the human..
Don't step in that pile of pup right out the door.
>"The hooman's back!"

FTFY
Chain reaction game is real. 
You know his tinder game is fire right now

"fucker is here, GET HIM!! DON'T LET HIM ESCAPE"
Why do dogs get like this? Theyre not as excited when they see each other, but when the hooman appears theyre ready.
i want all of them 
That's a bunch of Fluffy  doggies, just wanna hug them ALL, at the SAME TIME~
Zerg rush! 
This is far too cute! Dogs are the best!

Oh the babies
Holy puppies, Batman!! üòÆ
I used to feed stray dogs when i was a kid. My mom still makes some sweet nutritious food for a stray female dog when she gets pregnant and post-delivery as it‚Äôs always hard for puppies to survive in cold weather (surviving on milk only). 

Usually, at dinner time, I used to whistle a specific tune and the whole family comes within few mins within 100-150 yards. 

I‚Äôve seen the same reaction more than a thousand time but only a few survives against the nature‚Äôs will. 
Why is there so many? Surely one dog can't have that many puppies. Right?  Any puppyologists here? 
They looked like a downed Watcher to me at first.   Now I wish Watchers gave you puppies instead of Shards.  


how many? I got 17. 
Did all those come from the same mom?
I wonder, if I laid down would they cuddle me and keep me warm? I could use a nap as we speak, and they look comfy...
I was expecting more
‚ÄúThe foods here!‚Äù
*hoomans
This is what my heaven looks like...
On one hand, *don't wake the puppies!!!!*

But on the other... That was hecking **adorable**

They got all excited and ran to their owner, we dont deserve dogs
Whatttoe is dogs are these?
Gimme
As the owner of a 6 Mo old border collie...YEP.
And now I own 17 dogs
I wish I could double like this!!

I feel sorry for the mom 
omg so cute
Oh to one day have that many puppies glad to see me..... sigh
Aw they look like Pyranees mixes. Definitely solid LGD stock. 
Those pups are the best thing I‚Äôve seen so far in 2018 lol! Happy new year
This is what I imagine heaven would be like
I will take a dozen
This is what heaven must be like. 
Tooo damn adorable. Their slow reaction nails it
How can I live this life
this is too mutch, i just cant. My male brain is overloading with this kind of cuteness, need to watch violent sports
I just wanna lie down in the whole thing 
Bury me in these pls k thank.
There are so many of them!!! What a great start to the year. 
I WANT ALL OF THEM.

So many of them!!
are these strays?
May be a stupid question as I admitedly know little about dog breeds, but what kind of dogs are they? They're so cute!
So is this person a breeder? I know breeding is frowned upon with so many orphans to be rescued but got damn, I would love to do whatever this person does. Living dreams.
That‚Äôs an damn near close to a legit infestation
Is this what heaven looks like?
Why is there only one tail wagging?
wow i just love it
Me too thanks
Lovely. Had no idea they would sleep like this.
Australian invasion
Ah yes. The perfect way to start my year.
This is possibly the only stampede that I'd like to be in the middle of.
If that‚Äôs 1 litter holy shit. The runt is easy to spot. Black and white just to the right of the green door by the brown and white one next to the green door.
Too many puppies!
Heckin cute
I was unreasonably worried that they we could get scared and run away.
I want this many puppers in my life.
Obviously.....I love the delayed reactions. So cute!
There are nearly enough dogs
They all look like good boys. But which one is THE good boy? ü§î
