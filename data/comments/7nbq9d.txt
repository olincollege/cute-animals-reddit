I love the delayed reactions. So cute!
A puppy pile!
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon 
The puppies apparently belong to a place in Utah called Green Valley Aussies. They breed the dogs as well as train them for farm work and showing.

This is apparently a mix of 4 different litters from 4 different mamas. The place looks pretty clean and the dogs all well-kept, so that’s good. 
Perfect amount of puppies per m^3
Blue merle Aussies 😍
My favorite kind of stampede!
This is the pure version of that gif of a guy sticking his hand into a pile of daddy longlegs.
“The human’s back!”
I'm gonna lay down, and have someone put as many of those puppies on my body as they can
Get these puppies a bed!!

I want to see a time lapse of them all deciding to fall asleep together in same spot.
Australian Shepherds!! :)
*Lays down flat*
This is how I would like to be greeted in heaven!
*human’s
so many tiny aussie potatoes!! 
Litter of puppies at my house at the moment. Very familiar with this. =D
Why are all these puppies sleeping in dirt ???
Hooman!? Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman! Hooman!
♫♪ He's the man ! with the food and the ball ! ♪♫

How did you know which house we were in ?
I count 18? 
What is going on here? 
"101 Aussies."

Look at these heckin freeloaders, GET A JOB YOU BUMS! 
That has got to be at least 2 litters, right? No way one dog can carry that many puppies. 
From the thumbnail picture, I thought it was a bunch of Roombas lol 
I love how they are sleeping huddled together like that. So cute and cozy
Contrary to popular belief, these organisms are actually a collective and form a superorganism - some say that the species is an offshoot of Supercute puppylickus
This. Is. A. DREAM 😍
That's a lot of puppers
It’s like that scene in Dunkirk when the soldiers notice the fighter plane coming. 
The puppy's burst to life!
PUPPY STAMPEDE
It's like a parade of puppies! 
Where do I get one of those magic boxes and how can I climb into that cuddle puddle?!?


Whatever you do, don't get them wet, and don't feed them after midnight.

[Here's the source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvUSNX1beO4) of this gif.

And as others have mentioned in the thread, this is NOT a puppy mill. This is from a responsible breeder called Green Valley Australian Sheperds.
Guinea dogs!
Is this one litter?
/r/awwakeup would love this, please x-post!
Crouching tiger, hidden puppy. 
Pup-pup-pup-pup-PUPPIES!
It's a Dothraki horde of puppies!
 Beardies and Aussies!!!
This is the opposite of a wasps nest
I'd love to pet all of those puppies
When I die send me here
Do I see an Old English Sheeodog or two in there?
fuck men only 5 seconds video.
Aussies!!!
I gasped
Wait, there was only about 15 or 20 there... Where are the other 81-86?
I counted 17 puppies. Did one dog have 17 puppies???!!!
Human detected...

Initiating swam manoeuvre.

ATTACK MODE ENGAGED.
Is it healthy to keep that many puppies?
I’m just wondering why this many puppies are behind a wooden plank...
I don't mean to be that guy, but there's a typo in the title. Sorry, I am that guy
farm dog had a litter, iirc.

Contrary to what people say, this isn't a puppy mill. In puppy mills they're kept in cages.
~~IIRC this was a puppy mill~~

Edit: NOT a puppy mill, I did not remember correctly
This is what it looks like when you disturb a momma wolf spider and like 1000 babies scatter from her abdomen.

One of them looks exactly like zigzagoon!
This is what my life is missing
What breed is the grey and brown one?
What happened next?!?
I need to encounter this at least once in my life. 
Ohhh...myyyy....lanta...soo many puppies
Cuddle Puddle!!
Is this heaven?
That’s the best!!!
I’ve been looking for this forever. Thank you :)
Omg. I want this. 
This makes me feel happy and my heart content! 
This would instantly melt my heart 
Please let me have one pleeeeeease!
Give me puppies
I feel so bad for that pupper momma.... that is a lot of puppers...
I want them all
*"The humans are back!" "The humans are back!" "The humans are back!"*
Went from "Huh seems they don't care that-" to 

"jeebus  how much dogs do you own?"
I want them, I want them all to live with me.
Holy crap the cuteness!
Puppies, so metal 
Why do they have so many puppy’s

Seriously. AWWW

Happy New Year!  Let’s have a pawsitive one!  4realz
That is just too cute. Im pretty sure this sub helps my depression a great deal :)
This is how I want to die 
I think I found heaven.
Gf is mad at me, this is exactly what I needed. 
Puppies! Puppies, puppies, puppies!!!

FTFY
This is the kind of life I want to lead one day.  Puppy welcoming brigade!
This is what happiness looks like.
/r/bettereveryloop
Cuteness overload
Pretty sure someone just announced they had food. 
I count more each time. I'm up to 18?
Oh sweet honourable Jesus. 
Please never let this gif end
When I get to Heaven this is how I want to be greeted by all the dogs I've loved in my life.

Got a lot more dogs to love before then.
I know I know, so cute. But dammit, if no one else will say it: *human's*
Aussies!!!:)

HAha I'm an overnight Vet tech and that's exactly what happens when I get the kids up for breakfast and morning treatments 
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon 
Comments were at 666 so I made it 667
this is like the opposite of that gif where someone disturbs a fuzzy pile and spiders go everywhere
Why are they just laying out in the dirt? :( 
Looks like a bunch of Aussies 
Why are they outside?
Oh my gosh, reminds me of when my Aussie had 13 puppies in one litter (with a border collie) they looked just like this!
I hope this is what happens when we arrive in heaven 😍😍😍 
The look on any dog’s face when you get home is enough for most people to brighten up, no matter how bad their day was. I love that.
I want someone to add to the "attention" icon from metal gear.
I believe the scientific term for this is a "clusterpup."
FFFOOOOOODDDDD
OMFG * - *)
To be surrounded by puppies would be my idea of heaven on Earth. They are so adorable and so many, I would feel obligated to hold every single one of them.
Those sweet puppies should be inside :-)
What do I have to do to have this many Australian shepherds?
I'm a grown ass man and I'd loose my shit if I saw all those puppies. 
O.M.G Puppies!!!!
I want one.   
Uhm, yes adorable, but that's alot of puppies at one person's place, what's up with that? 
I don't wanna be rich or famous. I just want this.

The [shadow](https://imgur.com/a/LqWTQ) of a mature dog is their mother. The puppies woke up probably hungry for milk which proves this.

It's *elementary* my dear Watson
This is what heaven looks like. 
Are they border collies or Aussies?
I WANT THE PUPS, please 😭
Awww, dog breeders!
Are they usually supposed to be left out like that? Looks like a mill :\

Edit: thanks for the responses, TIL :)
Jesus christ, how many puppies did that mama pump out? 
[deleted]
puppy MILL - see the mnumma
This is like the complete opposite of what happens when you find a litter of stay cats.
/u/emhart199 
Why are those puppies in the dirt?!! Give them a home, or at least a home for them to hang out in until the get adopted!
[removed]
Adopt don’t shop. 
sooo a puppy mill??
This is really sad to see the conditions they are living. 
aww a puppy mill, how cute.
Not to be a downer here but why so many pups? Thats more than just one litter of pups. This isnt one of those puppy mills is it?
Am I the only one that gets sad watching this? The puppies look cold and dejected. 😞 
Ughhhh...breeders
It's a trap!
"Foooooood!!"
They just keep coming!
Where can I get one of these puppers?! They are SO adorable. I live for cute pups like these!!!
A litter of a litter
So that’s what heaven looks like!
I want all of them.  Until it's time to pick up poop.
I’m setting an alarm so this is the last thing I see in 2017. 
I wish I knew someone with this many puppers.. I'd visit them more than I visit my grandma. 
Back? How the fuck could someone leave that incredible pile of love!?

I'm sorry you passed away OP, but at least you led a good life and are now in heaven
Do you just feel like a god when that happens? 
DDR
I’ll take three. Thanks!

I can smell the puppy breath from here. Awwwww
The horde approacheth!

###***"Human! Grant us your tummy rubs!"***
Puppers
Is this heaven?
I want them
That sums up my life in one gif! 

Every year I hope of starting anew but nah life has its own way of throwing problems at me! 

Similar to the pups in the gif, there’s always a problem I’m trying to avoid but nah it has to come throw itself on me! 

**Sad life!**

Dogs really do love us as one of their own. So cute.
I NEED THEM ALL
https://youtu.be/ypEaGQb6dJk?t=2m27s

They want food.
I want one...
Holy Crud! Is that one litter?
They’re like zombies... One notices a human and the horde ensues
[Reminds me of this, but much cuter](https://filmdebrief.com/images/soldiers-on-mole-in-dunkirk-gif.gif)
Tribbles!
This warms my cold heart 
I wish that was me so bad
I need those.

I was really hoping there was one that just slept through the whole thing...
Im trying to spot which one takes the initiative first to make a move towards the human..
Don't step in that pile of pup right out the door.
>"The hooman's back!"

FTFY
Chain reaction game is real. 
You know his tinder game is fire right now
nice
That's my new year's resolution: cuddle with countless of fluffy puppies <3
Human’s*
Jeff, did you piss on my shoulder?
My life is not complete until I experience this
I can smell that puppy breath from here
*Human's 
Can i have one?
Aussies are to best!!!! Love mine
This is my happy place
You dropped this '
Can this be me
I love puppy piles! 
Wow that’s a lot of puppies 💜
I love that little runt puppy
You spilled your puppies
I just melted inside 
I want to see the going to sleep video
💜💜💜 made my heart smile!!! Thanks for sharing!!! 
Is this heaven?
"fucker is here, GET HIM!! DON'T LET HIM ESCAPE"
Why do dogs get like this? Theyre not as excited when they see each other, but when the hooman appears theyre ready.
i want all of them 
That's a bunch of Fluffy  doggies, just wanna hug them ALL, at the SAME TIME~
Zerg rush! 
This is far too cute! Dogs are the best! 
I wanna be the puppy in the middle - the warmest pup!!
So many pups!
I wanna sleep right in the middle of this puppy pile.

Looks like people leaving Times Square after the ball drops. 
Oh the babies
Holy puppies, Batman!! 😮
I used to feed stray dogs when i was a kid. My mom still makes some sweet nutritious food for a stray female dog when she gets pregnant and post-delivery as it’s always hard for puppies to survive in cold weather (surviving on milk only). 

Usually, at dinner time, I used to whistle a specific tune and the whole family comes within few mins within 100-150 yards. 

I’ve seen the same reaction more than a thousand time but only a few survives against the nature’s will. 
Why is there so many? Surely one dog can't have that many puppies. Right?  Any puppyologists here? 
They looked like a downed Watcher to me at first.   Now I wish Watchers gave you puppies instead of Shards.  


how many? I got 17. 
Did all those come from the same mom?
I wonder, if I laid down would they cuddle me and keep me warm? I could use a nap as we speak, and they look comfy...
I was expecting more
“The foods here!”
*hoomans
This is what my heaven looks like...
On one hand, *don't wake the puppies!!!!*

But on the other... That was hecking **adorable**
Dem stubby fluffballs jesus christ
this is almost enough dogs 
Did a dingo eat your baby!?
Yucky yuck yuck!!!!!
Aww
😘
The human's back

GODDAMN
so cute
Awwwwwwww
Damn. I wish I could wake up like that!
I want the black one
The grey (gray?) one on the left started it. 
They got all excited and ran to their owner, we dont deserve dogs
Whatttoe is dogs are these?
Gimme
As the owner of a 6 Mo old border collie...YEP.
And now I own 17 dogs
I wish I could double like this!!

I feel sorry for the mom 
omg so cute
Oh to one day have that many puppies glad to see me..... sigh
Aw they look like Pyranees mixes. Definitely solid LGD stock. 
Those pups are the best thing I’ve seen so far in 2018 lol! Happy new year
This is what I imagine heaven would be like
I will take a dozen
This is what heaven must be like. 
Tooo damn adorable. Their slow reaction nails it
How can I live this life
this is too mutch, i just cant. My male brain is overloading with this kind of cuteness, need to watch violent sports
I just wanna lie down in the whole thing 
Bury me in these pls k thank.
There are so many of them!!! What a great start to the year. 
I WANT ALL OF THEM.
Is this literally heaven? 
Cute

So many of them!!
are these strays?
May be a stupid question as I admitedly know little about dog breeds, but what kind of dogs are they? They're so cute!
So is this person a breeder? I know breeding is frowned upon with so many orphans to be rescued but got damn, I would love to do whatever this person does. Living dreams.
That’s an damn near close to a legit infestation
Is this what heaven looks like?
Why is there only one tail wagging?
wow i just love it
Me too thanks
Lovely. Had no idea they would sleep like this.
Australian invasion
Ah yes. The perfect way to start my year.
This is possibly the only stampede that I'd like to be in the middle of.
If that’s 1 litter holy shit. The runt is easy to spot. Black and white just to the right of the green door by the brown and white one next to the green door.
Too many puppies!
Heckin cute
I was unreasonably worried that they we could get scared and run away.
I want this many puppers in my life.
Obviously.....I love the delayed reactions. So cute!
There are nearly enough dogs
They all look like good boys. But which one is THE good boy? 🤔
Let us in so we can sleep on the couch.
