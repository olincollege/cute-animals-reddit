These remakes getting more and more realistic
I read somewhere the way the dragons move is actually partially based on cats, I think.
Live action How To Train Your Dragon 2020
Mum: we have how to train your Dragon at home

How to train your Dragon at home:
I love these movies and I  love cats so this is genius to me
This would fit well on r/catsnamedtoothless !
Dragons are just lizard hardware with cat software anyway
Purrrr-fect!
They about to slap box
"they are the same picture"
Man that Toothless - what an actor!
[my dogs too](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/frphg6/just_a_photo_of_my_dogs/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
Well the night/light fury were partly modeled/based on cats
I like both
They are the same picture...
Corporate wants you to find the difference between these 2 pictures.
Now kith
This is pawsitively cute
Ah forbidden love, basement cat and attic cat, together at last.
life imitates art
Post it on r/httyd
Why would you post the same picture twice?
Me: I want toothless 
Mom: we have toothless at home
Toothless at home:
u/worstjinxuniverse
even the lighting is similar

Great job
Is that Zion?
thought you could copy paste the image and we wouldn't notice?
Their kid may be gray...
I wonder if they thought of that before taking the photo
THATS SO FUCKIN CCUUUTTTEEE
How to train your dragon was amazing, especially the first movie. The third one was ok but the ending made it for me.
What's more difficult: how to train your dragon, or how to train your cat?
this is one epic pic, I love it!
I love how even the eyes match. It's beautiful.
r/walmartcelebrities
the eyes match Ö
"Close enough"? I'm guessing that the black cat's tail is normal.
Cat is fine too.
That is beautifull!
Why does the white dragon look like some sort of cheap Malaysian cartoon ?
Toothless really is just an adorable silly cat
Hey wait a minute.... that's  not a blue eyes white dragon
Romantic..... as....... FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
I wanna pat those heads.
MY GOD IM POOR BUT PLEASE MEDAL THIS. awwwwww
rtx off vs rtx on
Thats fucking cute
Inb4 the cats start slapping each other
[removed]
I love this
About the distance? Yes
Luna and Artemis!
Yes I love the cats
Category: Interracial
This remake looks so realistic! The power of technology is amazing...
😍😍
Purrfect. 😻😻
Cute
Low Budget Cosplay
Toothless is essentially a flying firebreathing cat with the loyalty of a dog
This is adorable and keeping me sane during quarantine.
NARUTO!! SASUKE!!!!
so cute
I thought they act more like dogs
Seconds later they was a cat fighting.
Awwww
Nice
Same vibes
The right is definitely preparing for landing. R/airplaneears
That white one is about to cut a bitch
I Love you
For all the animal behaviour experts.. what does the ears folded back mean in this situation? Scared?
Just add a lil CGI
cuties! 😻
does the eyes match too? damn
Hey why does your Void^TM have a face
I love interracial
Fuck yeah, close enough. 

Might could be the same thing!
Nice
Awwww I miss my cat
aw so cute. do cats have to social distance?
Bruh even the black cat's eyes are the same colour as Toothless
Same 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
66.6 k upvotes, are you the Devil?
Moments before the cat swatting fight begins
It’s perfect 👌 I don’t see any differences a work of art!
"I have the high ground"
Same energy
This makes me feel good
That's some 100% epic shitty cosplay right there folks
But instead, the cats smack each other in the face
If I ever get a black cat I want to name it Toothfull.
Where's Hiccup?
They got that same energy tho
Same same
Those cats really want to fuck each other up.
Day 20 of Quarantine
Love the eyes on the black cat, very Toothless.The white cat is great, but does not look spirited enough! Keep trying guys, you cant get much closer!
live action
loving these remakes
Every dragons movie, night furies just remind me of cats. They act like it too.
Even the black cat’s eyes are green
Honestly I think this is one of the best recreations of this scene
So cute
Omg I love toothless ❤❤
Excuse me this is not 6 feet apart
This looks so cute
That black cat looks a lot like my black cat, lmao
Iconic af ❤
r/DragonsAreCats
omg this is adorable
Tiny little dragons
LOVE THIS
Can't tell if the white catter has the same eye color as Light Fury, looks brown from the picture
<3 I have a black and white cat and they are very much like this!
I love the r/airplaneears/ on the white kitty.  I'm not sure she's 100% with the program here.
I love it! That’s a great photo! I have an all black kitty and an all white kitty too!

Netflix live-action?
How to train your cat: into the catto world
Aww I LOVE this! lol they are a perfect match lol.
It's clearly the how to train your dragon franchise but can someone tell me the specific movie the first one is from
In about a year, nobody will probably get the reference I'm making here, but here we go:

Memento Mori.

Unus Annus.
this is NOT proper social distancing
The cats are much more terrifying!
N
Gonna tell my kids this was Unus Annus
Awww!!
Alt right's triggered
😍😍😍😍😍
