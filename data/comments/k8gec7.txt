My lower back felt this.
The more cats I saw, the harder it was for me to decide whether this was heaven for me or hell for my work.
Girl: "I need to get up"

Cat: "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"
Ah yes, not being able to move so long your leg falls asleep because you don't want to wake the cat.
hahaha -

1st half - how many cats are under there?

Then - Is there a cat in her pant leg?
I love the dirty look given out by the orange tabby when she has the nerve to try to reposition her obviously numb leg
I was waiting to see how many cats she had under her sweater, it was a game for me. More than I thought.
Can anyone tell what the sweatshirt thing she is wearing is? I know someone who wants it for Xmas
Did anyone else think that was just one enormous orange cat for a split second
struggle snuggles
That‚Äôs not a person, that‚Äôs 12 cats in a trench-coat!
I have [three](https://i.imgur.com/8joS1YF.jpg) and they all demand my attention in different ways during the day.

[**Ra:**](https://i.imgur.com/JUulIoS.jpg) Takes what he wants

[**Isis:**](https://i.imgur.com/SDUOoi8.jpg) Preferers to snuggle

[**Nut:**](https://i.imgur.com/ZXhVnNB.jpg) Demands her own seat
The cat with their head on the computer was just too much, so cute
How do you sit cross legged for long without debating if you should just amputate from the knee down instead of enduring the struggle of standing up again?
Aww they love her so much
I am her but with bunnies. But I also have to watch out for the cables because they love chewing them.
Aaaand there is more.... Kitties.
That's a lot of cuddles!
The worst is when you have to get up and they look at you like, "Why are you doing this?"
Where can I get this life?
5 cats in a trenchcoat
Ergonomics, schmergonomics.
I wonder what the litter box situation is like, I got two cats and that's too much poop for me already
Yep... you WILL attract cats if you get comfy on the couch.
When she tried to strech her legs and was trying not to disturb the cats, I felt that.
That hoodie was definitely designed by a cat-owner.
I wish I wasn't allergic to cats
My neck, shoulder, back, hips, and knees hurt from looking at this posture. I'm only 30 üò©
What a fantastic problem to have lol
You can love your pets and still set limits.
She is a trooper, working on a touchpad. That drives me insane, I need a mouse.
This is very cute but my god looking at how she works is giving me a bad back!
The cat on the left looks like it's pulsating with some sort of demon kitty inside of it bc of the fast forward lmao
This is my dream
All I see here is my dream
I love cats so much, I‚Äôd die to have a bunch sleep on me like that.
I like how she‚Äôs trying to negotiate with the cats to move. 

‚ÄúPlease get up‚Äù
‚ÄúNo‚Äù
‚ÄúPlease my foot is going to fall of if you don‚Äôt‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs part of the job Sarah you knew that when you started‚Äù
Hi,surprise~ I‚Äôm very happy to see my video are liked by so many ppl but could you inform me at least before you post my video? üòπ
I thought she was gonna shake another cat out of her pants at the end there.
I never thought I‚Äôd say this but this.... might be too many cats.
This is my dream
The phone is the bigger distraction, by a wide margin.
1.  You can tell she‚Äôs a good cat mom and her cat babies love her

2.  I get the struggle, but I‚Äôm jealous her cats like each other. My two boys never cuddle each other. 

3.  The solution to this struggle is a drawer with a heating pad and a fleece blanket. My needy boi sleeps right there in my desk while I work. He gets periodic pets, I get to keep the feeling in my legs. Win:win
damn.. she is 4 cats deep in being single
Does u/savevideos work?
The Life.
Get off me!! I gotta pee! LOL
I feel this but in place of 4 cats it's one very needy min pin hahaha
No wtf didn't you know the rules of cat lover!?! Rule number 3 1,1If a Cat sit ON your lap it is illigal to move!
How many cats she own?
That moment when you think the orange cat is really long.
Wow, thanks for sharing this video, it shows how much you love the cats. I also love cats.
With cats and smartphone, you have to be focused with an iron will to work efficienctly

Legend has it she's still there to this day.

There is like 3 cats under her robe and the cats are HUGE. Love it.....
I don‚Äôt know how they got this actual footage of me working from home, but me and all my cats don‚Äôt appreciate being filmed in the privacy of our own home. Don‚Äôt ever talk to me or my cat or my cat or my cat or my cat ever again.
Lolol. When she picked up her sweater and there were more!
How does one sit in that position for hours??? Sitting cross legged makes my legs hurt after a few minutes. Just being super flexible?
Younger people, please don't sit like that. You will regret it when you turn 30ish.

Source: I never gave a fuck about posture until now that I'm 34.

This makes me think of those hens that adopt a litter of kittens, and the hen lifts up and there's just a gaggle of warm babies underneath
Oh I know the struggle. Sometimes I have 4 cats at once. Like her, you can‚Äôt get up or move because they‚Äôre too heavy.
She won't be getting chilly!
Omg I did not expect so many cats underneath üòÇ 
I also like how the grey cat is just chilling on the side. What an adorable bunch ü•∞
*Working from home snuggles
I want this problem
"Come on kitties. Got to move. Mommy's legs are asleep. Come on. Let mommy up. Mommy's got to move. COME ON. MOVE." You're lying if you say you've never had the "we have to get up" argument with your animals
Its called "purralysis"
This is getting to crazy cat lady levels.
You need a proper desk and chair. You're guna be in pain if you keep sitting like this.
So at which point do you graduate from being an  intermediate cat owner and move on to become an advanced level cat hoarder?
way too many cats!
Ahh the crazy cat lady
I still don't understand how after like nine months of working from home so many people have done nothing to improve their setup. At the start I suffered along and as I realized it wasn't changing set myself up a dedicated office area to work from. My home office area is as good or better than what I have at work now
I bet that house smells awful.
Lol. I feel this
I have two dogs and i feel this pain. Also when i need to work and tbey want attention or they want to play
Sir, is this your cat?

No.

Is this your cat?

No.

I was wondering how she sat like that without her leg being dead.

Man how can you have 4 cats and not have them hate each other? Mine could barely tolerate her sister cuz it meant less attention for her lmao.
Everyone‚Äôs cats on here are so nice. My cat lets me scratch her for about 5 seconds then wants to rip my hand off
I‚Äôm waiting to see the struggle ... seems like heaven to me

I feel obliged not to move if I have ONE cat on me. In her situation I wouldn't ever make it out of bed in the morning.
Needles in the foot
My legs are falling asleep simply by watching her
In Soviet Russia you don‚Äôt own cat, cat own you.
You don‚Äôt own four cats because this is something you *don‚Äôt want.* this is like best case scenario for a cat person.
What is the thing she is wearing with the hood called?
Aw yes sorry no sympathy from me for these ‚Äòstruggles‚Äô
Struggles or snuggles
I would call this snuggles, not struggles. and where do you get that sweater :)
congratulations you gave given birth to a cat
Looks cozy, but my neck and back hurt just looking at this.
damn that‚Äôs a whole lotta love.
Oh, yeah. You can forget getting up when they‚Äôre comfy. I becomes a new life principle when you become a cat parent.
And she's had to pee for the last 45 min.
What is this black magic?  Our cats only pretend to tolerate us when they are hungry. Her's seem to genuinely like her!?
This poor woman gonna have back issues typing like that.
I wfh now and I‚Äôm distracted 90% of the time, but somehow I‚Äôm still more productive than In an office environment..
How is she not sweating her butt off?
If I were wearing half those layers, I‚Äôd be drenched in sweat
The itching and knocking on your own leg to wake it up is relatable as fuck with animals who like to snuggle lol
Somebody add in the ‚ÄúKing of the Hill‚Äù theme song
Whaaaaat there were THREE under that poncho blanket ??
this made me smile , thank you :)
This is ridiculous. Sit at a desk..
God I wish my cats were able to chill calmly like that with me. Mine prefer the "roll all over your bed/the couch and meow every second you're not petting them, stopping for even a second is not allowed". Takes *forever* to get them to chill tf out.
Watching as I'm covered in Shih tzus, the cats of the dog breed..
I love how the one cat is like "well I'M not moving".
Why does she record her self?
What a hard job :/ She almost lost her leg
Really, if you're struggling, I hope it's like this! If not I hope it makes you grin. I did.
Ahh I see the problem. She has too many fucking cats.
I see no struggle. Just snuggle.
The ultimate cat lady
Where can I get that hoodie!!!!
I aspire to be this woman
She's simultaneously a crazy cat lady and a hot water bottle.
Cats didn't even help knead her numb leg. All take, no give.
Best office ever
Legs asleep. That happens.
My cat will cry and bite my legs until I step away from my desk. I love her, and I know seeing me at home more makes her happy, but I got work to do!
My back hurts just looking at her hunched over like that. ‚ò†Ô∏è
That‚Äôs a lot of cats.
Cats comfort before her own, lol. Im the same way ill sit/lay there until I just can't anymore bc I don't wanna make kitty move. üòú
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day!
Definitely more cats there than expected. But, the more cats the merrier!
She really needs a proper chair else her back is gonna be in bits in a few years.

This is more like a work from home miracle
Lol why is this me
This is so precious. I love how she's just so accommodating to those babies, really shows how much she cares about them and loves them. They may be a nuisance sometimes but it's so, so worth it. There's nothing like the love that kitties show their owners, it's just amazing.
Keep expecting to see a 5th cat pop up somewhere.
Hahaha when my work is slow, I sit on the couch next to my desk. My cat has learned if the phone rings, I'm getting up.
Where can I get this fuzzy sweater??
Snuggles.  

Reminded me of the simpsons where they showed the first ever woman to be both a lawyer and doctor plunge into lunacy and become crazy cat chucking lady down the street


Wait her pauncho has cat paws on it
I like what I assume is the apology to the grey cat when she tries to move and disturbs him
Omg, me while trying to teach, grade, or even function with my two pugs XD
I want her coat
This looks so comfortable and enjoyable in a weird way.  I love being stimulated while simultaneously being comfortable and loved!!!  I know you were working but it's times like those that time stands still..
It‚Äôs like cell division
My 4yo 100lb golden retriever does this to me! All his weight too. He still thinks he's a puppy lol.

This. Except with kids.
Fucking disgusting to have that many cats. Her home probably smells like litter box and piss
6 litter boxes...no thanks.
Cute cats aside, sitting like that for any extended period of time hurts my back.
That home smells like cat piss, I guarantee it.
That is too many cats lol. I think 2 is how many i'd want so they have company I guess.
My puppers is behind me in my work chair all day. She keeps me warm at least. And stays out of trouble...

Those are big cats
My cat enjoyed watching this from my lap.
This hurts my back and knees just watching it.

Really ..truth of the work from home

"Ho no I'm stuck :0"
Cat cheeks on warm laptops are the best cheeks!
Now that's what I call a cat lady
For a minute I thought there was only 2 cats and then I realized that there was 3
I love my cats, but damned if they don't stop you from doing things.
Obviously they're cold af. Turn on the damn heat!
This is her life meow
This happened to me half an hour ago. Cat crawled onto my lap, and then he stood on the keyboard and accidentally sent a bunch of gibberish via office IM to one of my coworkers. üòÜ
This gives me the urge to get up and pee. üòπ
Oh no, she spilled her cats
u/plantsandpumpkin u wish
*Cries in ergonomics*
I missed my ex tapping that numbing legs. She gets irritated while me keeps tapping.
When the view zoomed in on her foot wiggling, I thought she'd have a cat or two attacking the foot any second. I'm a little disappointed.

/edit: typo
This is the exact opposite of a problem lol
Stretching the leg out while trying to offend the cats as little as possible is very relatable to me.  My husband always says, "Just get up!" because he doesn't get it.
That‚Äôs not a struggle that‚Äôs amazing
That position looks so painful for the neck...
It has a human so initially from me it's a no, but damn that's cute
Needing so badly to feel your foot again but regretting it immediately when it causes the cat to move. Every cat owner‚Äôs personal dilemma.
This is me, but with kids...
She's full of cats.
I wake up with my pitbull sleeping on my legs every night. He has to be on top of me somehow.
So this is the famous cat lady?
Lmao! The fourth cat got me. I need a little hoodie like that or one that has a big pouch for the kitty to sleep in. Also, that couch is the chef‚Äôs kiss epitome of comfort for me. I love those couches with the big chunky cushions and 90‚Äôs upholstery. Reminds me of my childhood and all the bomb ass cushion forts I made.
That lady needs a mouse
I see no struggle whatsoever.
More like, "work from home snuggles."

I was waiting for the moment when she was going to start reasoning with the cats because she had to move her legs.
That is a struggle. She wanted to move, but in her heart she knew that it's wrong to move if a pet is sleeping on you.

I saw some news stories recently with people complaining about working from home.  Things like they have to work more and always feeling like they are at work.  Talk about 1st world problems.

No commute. No dressing up.  Your kitchen and bedroom and pets are all there.  No asshole bosses looking over your shoulder.   No asshole co-workers bothering you.  I guess it's not for everyone and depends what you do but working from home is my dream job.

Cats are prey as well as predators so I imagine the lap of the big kind animal would be the safest place to sleep. I find that kinda aww :)

How do you think her boyfriend/husband feels about all those cats?

You know that's a trick question right? The answer is..."There is no boyfriend/husband". This poor girl is in the beginning stages of "Cat-lady Syndrome".

My lap would be soooo HOT ü•µ.one time during a nap, a cat slept on me. And in my dream I thought someone lit my pants on fire.
From :22 to :36-ish, that's her explaining to the cat that he must move because her leg fell asleep. I know, I've been there. Cats don't care if your leg is asleep.
Wow, thanks for sharing this video, it shows how much you love the cats. I also love cats.
Seems more like having too many cats struggles.

Bless your heart!  I have a friend who works and loves cats too.
Alao, your cats just loooove you.  Very cool!
Wow, this lady cats
God I would LOVE to have this struggle
It's fun for about a day when ur pup wants to lay on ur lap but after a week ur like sorry fam I love ya but yeet ya ass over to the other cushion
Is this the actress from that Twitch commercial with the avengers gum?
Snuggle struggles
No I think she has an entirely different problem.

Thst cannot be good for her back leaning forward like that. First I thought she was sitting closer to the edge with feet on the ground lol. Makes me wanna get a cat during these times
This is exactly the kind of life I strive to live.
What an ergonomic catastrophe.
Being someone who sat like that for months in this lockdown and I can confirm she is damaging her back and neck because of this posture. I went to orthopedist for months then to physiotherapist (still going) and I just wanna let anyone who reads this know please take care of your body. I love animals...but they can sleep somewhere else too while you're working.
Doomed
I see no struggle. Just a fluff of warmth.
The Office Home edition

\-just play the Office opening to this vid!
Same!
Imagine explaining people from 100 years ago, this is what people would do for money in 2020
It‚Äôs just one ca- no now there are two- no three of them- four now!
Parents say she‚Äôs now a doctor and a lawyer.
I need more cats!
That‚Äôs not work.
My legs are cramping just watching this.
Seems like more of a cat issue
props to you for actually being able to work from home so well, I can't bring myself to do this when comfortable at home.
I watch this as I have a cat sitting in the back of my chair with her butt on my shoulder... being loved is pain, but we must struggle through and endure!
What was the final tally?
Why is she wearing hospital socks?
Well maybe don‚Äôt have four cats and dress yourself in a snuggly cat tent but I mean sign me up that looks great.
I frantically looked up and around. This person looks too much like me and also has a pink key off. I too am surrounded by four or more cats.
I love that she‚Äôs trying to discuss with the cats what the issue is. Cats don‚Äôt care.
I can feel this video in my legs....
Poor woman, it's like they're hibernating in her sweater belly.
I think our pets are using this time to remind us all what is actually important in life.
I love my kitties, but when they sit on me, I longer have legs. When they get off I can no longer feel my legs. So since I got cats, I lost my legs.
Working from home snuggles
When it zoomed on her feet I thought one of the cats was going to attack it.
It's a **cat**atsu ololololol
Probably , she has a backache. Coz, lt is hard to work like that
The last orange cat begins furiously cleaning himself instead of moving - he is busy, he can‚Äôt move.
Awww adorable hehe my doggies do this too! ü•∞ü•∫‚ò∫Ô∏è
Who's recording this? Lol
What is she wearing?
Work from home snuggles*
Didn‚Äôt expect so many cats
Still better then going to school
This is video comfypasta man. I dont know what the lady is working on but I hope she and her cats are having a wonderful time!
B-b-but muuuum
Am I a monster because I just move pets when they're in my way?
she's a good kitty-mama

That house definitely smells like cat piss.
Ooooo so cute.
I have 7 cats.
My allergic self would be even more so conflicted by this.
The dreaded sleep foot.
/r/scriptedasiancatgifs
Apparently single ladies need a cat on it
Crazy bitch
My legs are cramping watching this
What is the temperature in that house?
Man she must stink
I really wanna eat those bananas
What‚Äôs blast!
Kitties! That‚Äôs a great problem to have.
Story of my life üôÇ
shes like a mother bird keeping her eggs warm
The struggle is real
So...  Can anyone make it look like the foot is gasping for air at the end?  Hahaha
She hasn‚Äôt felt her legs since March.
u/savevideo

If the cat is sleeping on you, you don't move. Regardless of what you have to do.

Excluding the cats, her outfit looks so comfy
