I love the cats look at the end: okay, what was this, and why are you running?? 
"Good game."

"Good game."

"Good game."

That cat thinks they're all weird but is humoring them. You can tell it all from his expression at the end

Good work team ... Way to go ... Nice effort Steve ... Alright lets hit the showers
 I would be more inclined to workout if there was a cat high fiving me.
Cat 5 you say? That cat networks, he is well connected.
Imagine waiting for your turn and the cat doesn't slap your hand. **:'(**
i am the cat - am human's friend

i motivate from end to end

as they run past i tap their hand,

i wish them luck! they understand

i'm not like Dog in any way -

won't trot along - right Here i'll stay

for dogs - they run - try n' keep up

not me - i ain't no stupid pup!

dogs will come to You, you see

but I am CAT -

You come to *Me*

Why can't my cat be cool : (... Mine would be trying to bite all of them.
He sleeps 20 hours a day and is still in the best shape
This is the video I needed but didn’t know I needed to survive Monday. 
Every time I see a tabby I think they look just like my tabby cat.  Then after about 2 seconds I remember mine is way cuter and no one can change my mind about it.
Unless your tabby is wearing small clothes or a backpack.  That's pretty cute
Why can't all gyms be like this?
I love how the cat was like "Well, that was weird..."

Can you imagine what it would have felt like if it had left you hanging?

If I had that a cat like that at my job, it would be stress free.
I feel like in the end the cat was just like seriously?? No ones gonna stop and play with me?!
I love this! Tbh 90% of my motivation to go to hot yoga everyday is bc it's a small studio and the front desk employees are allowed to bring their dogs to work and said good boys come up and greet everyone at the door and receive pettings.

This needs  to be cross posted to  "cats with jobs"



Lmao!!
You try that with my cat, you're gonna need some peroxide.

All right, am I done yet, do I get my treat yet? "Is the thought of the cat while doing this".

Imagine the heartbreak if he leaves you hanging. Cats are savage.

This video put a huge smile on my face. Thank you. 
CrossFit Cat is the cheerleader we all deserve. 
I was kinda hoping he’d stiff the last guy.

Reeeeeeeepossttt
Attempt all the high fives you want, but beware, if you ever run away from the proper basement cat, it will chase you and lodge paws on your buttocks.
The kind of motivation I need 
If it was [this cat](http://imgur.com/gallery/DSKRMZl) he'd be like 100 times faster
It pleases me that precisely five "cat fives" were given. I was really hoping that would be the case. 
r/paww
I need this cat in my life! 
Good game, good game, good game...
So do we normally give human fives?
Gotta at least use cat 5e :D
Can you imagine if you were in that line and the cat looked you dead in the eyes and skipped you?
I would pay the $100+ membership just to get a high five from that kitty
r/paww
Awesome workout guys! LoL this is Adorable!
I'd go to THAT gym. No doubt.
Love it! 
Where can I sign up?! 
Just imagine being the *one* person the cat doesn't high five... You feel the hurt yet? Good.
Man if I had the opportunity to highfive a cat after an intense workout, I’d look like The Rock.
My cat does this except his claws are extended and he goes for blood. 
I take it the cat is Pepper, the owner of this Crossfit. Here Pepper is just finishing up the latest training session with a good ole high 5 to each crossfitter.
I love this confused look on their face xD 
But for real how do you properly teach a cat to high five??
u/megablah99
"ok where's my treat??"
I was disappointed. I thought the cat was going to leave that last guy hanging. 


Imagine how gutted you'd be if he left you hanging
Hahaha comments are to die for 😂
Love this tubby! 💗 I wander if it tried to scratch also as mine use to use its claws excessively 
"And i will slap you...and you...definitely you..."
It’s like the opening of Slam Dunk lol 
Jackie too late at the end.
Where the one person cat refuses to low five?

I wish there was a cat like this supporting in every gym 
I really hope its name is pepper.

Was the red shirt lady scared or something?  She pulled back the high five so quick
If that cat's name is NOT pepper, someone really missed an opportunity there.

WOD today is the Meowrph.
The guy in the white shirt was so far behind I had a feeling he’d get left hanging. Good to see that the cat is wholesome 
I wanna jump into the screen and hug that cat to death.
Man, i love this as much as the next person... But does anyone else feel like a cat running loose in a gym is a REALLY bad idea? Like, either that's how a person gets hurt, or a cat gets smooshed. 
I think the best part of this isn't the cat, but the people. Those genuine smiles just warm my heart.
My cat just keeps trying to mate with me. Seems like she's never not in heat.
Hi
The cat looks back realizing he used his claws
My cat would try to scratch out the eyes of everyone passing by.

Needs Tom Brady trying to get a high five and the cat disses him. I wish I was good at this stuff. Lol
Didn’t leave anyone hangin. What a good kitty
I was waiting for the guy at the end to be left hanging and the cat to be like “deal with it, bitch”.
My cat does this, It's amusing but all they really want is for you to scratch their head.
if there was a cat giving high fives at the gym i might go
Freaking Catfit! It's a cult!
Now do it with a Hemmingway and you get an upgrade. to cat 6 or cat 7 even.

that's some pawsitive reinforcement for sure 
The cat really just wanted to cut them but they are too fast 
The cat does not know why, but it knows that it is necessary nonetheless.
How it would feel to be the person the cat refuses to high 5?
Wait....what? Where's my treats??
😾😿
Title approved 
This cat is here every week. 
Why does all these cats look like mine?
That's soooo Cute!!
I would push myself to do so many more laps just to get more high fives

" i didn't just do that, you saw nothing!"
Cool

Such a gym cat 
Good kitty
This is the type of motivation I need to go to the gym
Id just do circles high fives all day.
I’d run past the cat and they would put their paw down.
Someone should have done the old down low to slow!
I’m surprised it didn’t cut up their palms

Was hoping he was gonna smack the bum of the last guy and grunt, “good hustle!”
Vicious predator attacks hundreds of civilians
You can see by his face, that he just wanted to high five the fitst one. But when the other started to high five him too, he was to embarass to stop.
And that's how I got chlamydia babe.
I want that cat at my gym!
Cat 5 or cat 5e? Big difference
She looked really reluctant on that last high five. Probably knows that person is an asshole.

That all look like they do crossfit. You can tell because it doesn't look like anyone exercises.
Wow. Rare to see a cat at a CrossFit gym. Box dogs are pretty common, but I can’t imagine a cat being around a bunch of people running, doing burpees, dropping barbells, etc.
Thanks for this
