Every time I see a tabby I think they look just like my tabby cat.  Then after about 2 seconds I remember mine is way cuter and no one can change my mind about it.
Unless your tabby is wearing small clothes or a backpack.  That's pretty cute
Why can't all gyms be like this?
I love how the cat was like "Well, that was weird..."

I love this! Tbh 90% of my motivation to go to hot yoga everyday is bc it's a small studio and the front desk employees are allowed to bring their dogs to work and said good boys come up and greet everyone at the door and receive pettings.

Attempt all the high fives you want, but beware, if you ever run away from the proper basement cat, it will chase you and lodge paws on your buttocks.
The kind of motivation I need 
If it was [this cat](http://imgur.com/gallery/DSKRMZl) he'd be like 100 times faster
It pleases me that precisely five "cat fives" were given. I was really hoping that would be the case. 
r/paww
I need this cat in my life! 
Good game, good game, good game...
So do we normally give human fives?
Gotta at least use cat 5e :D
Can you imagine if you were in that line and the cat looked you dead in the eyes and skipped you?
I would pay the $100+ membership just to get a high five from that kitty
r/paww
Awesome workout guys! LoL this is Adorable!
I'd go to THAT gym. No doubt.
Love it! 
Where can I sign up?! 
Just imagine being the *one* person the cat doesn't high five... You feel the hurt yet? Good.
Man if I had the opportunity to highfive a cat after an intense workout, I‚Äôd look like The Rock.
My cat does this except his claws are extended and he goes for blood. 
I take it the cat is Pepper, the owner of this Crossfit. Here Pepper is just finishing up the latest training session with a good ole high 5 to each crossfitter.
I love this confused look on their face xD 
But for real how do you properly teach a cat to high five??

The guy in the white shirt was so far behind I had a feeling he‚Äôd get left hanging. Good to see that the cat is wholesome 
I wanna jump into the screen and hug that cat to death.
Man, i love this as much as the next person... But does anyone else feel like a cat running loose in a gym is a REALLY bad idea? Like, either that's how a person gets hurt, or a cat gets smooshed. 
I think the best part of this isn't the cat, but the people. Those genuine smiles just warm my heart.
My cat just keeps trying to mate with me. Seems like she's never not in heat.

My cat does this, It's amusing but all they really want is for you to scratch their head.

You can see by his face, that he just wanted to high five the fitst one. But when the other started to high five him too, he was to embarass to stop.
